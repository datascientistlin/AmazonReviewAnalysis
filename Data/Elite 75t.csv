Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-26,Recommended for audiophiles who love bass,"I started out with the new Sony WF1000-XM3 earbuds. They got great reviews and I always try to buy the best - price is secondary to sound, for me. After using them for a day or two, I found myself very disappointed in the sound so I went back to the store to see if there was something better. These new Jabras caught my eye, with their small size. I read the specs and was impressed with the battery life. I knew the 65t was good, so I figured this would be 10 better. I exchanged the Sonys and brought the Jabras home. I have to say, I am very impressed with the sound these little guys put out. The bass is OUTSTANDING, to the point where I have considered EQing it down (and I love bass). What's really great though, is that the rest of the frequencies are well represented, even in the face of all that low-end. It's like a car system with really good mids and highs, but then a sub in the back. (Obviously not as good as a real sub, but you get the idea.) The size and fit are great too, a really impressive bit of engineering. I haven't tested max battery life, because they're always in the charging case when not in my ears and I don't listen for *that* long. Speaking of charging case, I really like how small it is - much smaller than the Sony case. I can fit it in my front jeans pocket along with my Note 9! The app is useful and appealing to the eye. It has a 5-band EQ that you can save your own presets into. I bumped the top end a tiny bit but otherwise the sound is on point right out of the box. If you are an audiophile who loves bass, and you want the best on the market, I recommend these Jabra 75t earbuds without reservation. (These should have a 5-star average, but some people don't get how product reviews work.)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-12-25,Great Wireless Earbuds,"So what are you looking for in an earbud? If it is a pair that is wireless, small and comfy, look great, and have great sound and battery life, these could be in your future. The first thing you want to do is download the app and update the firmware. That will take about 15 minutes, but you will be up and running afterwards. My favorite feature is the ability to tweak the EQ to taste. This alone will make it easy to get great sound no matter what you favor. Once you get the sound to your taste, you will notice clear separation of instruments and very good out of the head type of sound. Some people refer to this as ""head stage"". In my experience, these rival some open backed headphones for the out of the head sound quality. Next, the battery life is very good on these earbuds. You get around 7.5 hours on a charge and you can charge them in their portable case which will get you up to 28 hours of battery without needing to plug them in. The main shortfall here is that you can't listen to one while the other charges. Well, you can charge the left bud and listen to the right one, but you can't listen while charging the right bud. That being said, you can get an extra hour of play with a 15 minute charge. The controls on these buds is second to none. You can even control volume without evoking Siri. They also have the ability to connect to 8 different devices and 2 can be connected simultaneously. I tested this with a Mac and an iPhone. You can be listening on the Mac, pause music and start playing on the iPhone and it will simply switch right over. That is cool! It works the other way around, as well. These don't offer active noise cancelling. However, the bud fits in the ear canal deep enough that it blocks out most sound. They include a tech call ""hear through"" that uses the mics to make it easy to hear what is going on around you, though. There is a slight hum when you have this feature turned up all the way, but you can put it half way up and still be able to hear around you without the hum. For best sound quality, I would recommend turning this feature off. All in all, I am very happy with these buds. I really like the looks and sound quality of them. My only gripe is the inability to charge the right bud while listening to the left bud. This would be great for charging while listening to a podcast. However, everything else hits the mark.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

When i walk i can hear each step pound in my ears and sometimes can even hear my pulse. Handles sound and calls well but the hear-through feature creates quite a bit of static white noise. There is also a low level of static white noise when they are on but not in use (with hear-through turned off.) Overall they work fine but do not fit in small ears. unlike the models pictured, they do not sit flush in the ear and stick out quite noticeably.

I can usually use the medium one, so if yours don't seem like a tight fit, try the bigger ones. Setup was easy and it installed a new firmware before turning over control. The disappointing part is the Alexa implementation. I tried and tried to make it work because I subscribe to Amazon music, so I wanted to play tracks using Alexa. Sometimes I got Siri, the default assistant on my iPhone even though the setting in the app was for Alexa. Twice I got Alexa, but it only worked for a single command, then was unresponsive after that. Most of the time I double-clicked the right earbud to summon the assistant and got a quiet beep followed by unresponsive silence. So, good sound, small size and fit, but if you are trying to make Alexa work with these, I'd look elsewhere.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-01-17,Unfinished product with lots of bugs and issues.,"I would like to start off saying that I have tried multiple earbuds and I was really looking forward for an airpod pro alternative that wouldn’t break my bank as much . I currently own the Bose Soundsport truly wireless earbuds (released in 2017) , the Jabra Elite 65t Active (released 2018) and the Powerbeats Pro (released 2019) . The jabra 65t active was having call quality issues and my right earbud kept on moving off to the point they were going to fall of my ear so I have decided to give the 75t a try . The size of these earbuds are a huge improvement to the 65t and the case and battery life is also another great improvement. Now for the sound quality. They do sound a lot louder than the 65t but the bass is too overwhelming to the point that even if you lower the bass to the lowest level on the EQ, the bass is too overpowering to the point is not enjoyable or clean like my Bose Soundsport of the Powerbeats Pro. If I were to rank or refer someone to buy the best overall sound earbud , I would recommend them the Bose Soundsport , followed by the Powerbeats pro and then perphaps the 75t. Ear fatigue on these earbuds is eminent . I wore them a for a little over an hour and my ear canal was already hurting . I have also noticed the 75t only works with the right earbud as the master and the left earbud as the slave. The Powerbeats pro can work independently. I haven’t tried the call quality on the 75t but it is because of all the flaws it has , have forced me to put them down and continue using my older earbuds. I just wished they would have done a better job with the sound quality. Maybe a firmware update will fix this issue but for the time being , I wouldn’t recommend them . I would rather tell people to buy the 65t active that is going refurbished for less than $80 or to get themselves a refurbished powerbeats pro which offers a well balance sound , a comfortable experience , long battery life and great connection with your ios device.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

CAN'T LISTEN TO THE LEFT EARBUD WITHOUT THE RIGHT. Detailed review
I got these at the spur of the moment the other day while at best buy, I had heard Jabras had a really good sound quality and figured at the very least I will have a good set of back up buds if my Galaxybuds are out of juice or I forget them somewhere. After a very long update, I got right in to listening to music and was instantly impressed with how full the sound was, I compared these to my Samsung Galaxy buds and these made them sound flat by comparison, but noticed pretty quickly that they kind of hurt my ears. don't get me wrong, the shape is great and can be worn for hours with no issues, but the ear tips that come with them have a blunt tip to them leaving an almost squarish tip that really bothered my ear especially when removing them. I switched the tips with some with a more rounded tip and they are so much more comfortable, I cant hardly feel them in my ear at all. The App is great for these earbuds and the EQ setting makes a would of difference in the sound quality, unlike some cheaper earbuds. I would like it if there was a way to share EQ profiles like with the Jay Birds that my brother has, I'm not the best in the world at turning an EQ so it would be nice to see how others have theirs set. The audio passthrough is a nice feature and works just as well as the Samsung galaxy does, but with 1 big difference, you can use the passthrough with just 1 earbud in which is a nice touch. If you are afraid of losing an earbud these are perfect for you. These hare a GPS feature that shows the last location that they were connected, but they also have a find by sound mode that will save so much time if you lose them outside like brother and his jaybirds, that was a nightmare. My one real complaint is that if you want to listen to 1 earbud it has to the right earbud, its this reason these will not be my main set of earbuds. It is so annoying laying in bed with my girlfriend to my right and not be able to hear her if I'm listening to something when I wanted to be considerate and not make her listen to my video or music, but because of that I get chewed out for not listening to her just because my earbuds don't have what should be a basic feature, so I will be sticking with my Galaxy buds even though they don't sound as good. I really wanted to give these 3 stars just for this, but that would not be fair to how well these perform. Honestly Jabra, how can you not listen to the left earbud without the right this late in the game? My girlfriend has a 15 dollar air pod knock offs that can do it, and here I am with earbuds that run close to $200 feeling like a joke.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The passive noise cancellation is obviously not as good as the active noise cancellation you see in some of the other earbuds in the market right now, but as a daily commuter using public transit in NYC, I have no real complaints here either. In fact, one of my roommates says that the combination of the noise cancellation and low profile design has made it hard for him to tell whether or not I'm actually listening to him whenever he comes to talk to me.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-12-03,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Jabra Elite 75t Earbuds (HR).","Pros:__________
• Very small, compact, and a sleek design compare too many out there. Wearing these Jabra provides a minimalistic look that doesn’t draw any attention. This is something that Apple will never get back. • They have a secure tight fit. From my experience, there is no way that these earbuds will leave your ear unless you use your hands. I ran, went on a trampoline, and bobbled my head up and down when listening to Jimi Hendrix. Very sturdy, no wobble whatsoever. • They are comfortable to wear. The 75t rest on your ears, rather than relying on all the stability near the speaker end. Secure and comfort. • Excellent connection. No hiccups using them as a phone or just for music. Bluetooth 5.0, the 75t allows you to connect to your phone and another device if you want. • The case can go up to 28 hours. I didn’t test to see if this number is correct, but I did need to charge it after a week of use. • The case itself is super small and can be stood upright. Think Apple’s noise-canceling Airpods charging case, but a little smaller. My wallet and keys both can be fit in one pants pocket with this. • Magnetic seal on the case makes it to opens easily, and stays shut when you want it. The strength of the magnet can hold the earbuds upside down with them falling off. • The case has USB-C fast charging. A 10-minute charge gave the case 40 minutes more battery life. • You can check the battery levels for the case and the earbuds with the app (more details about the app later on). • The microphone layout is excellent. The 75t has a 4 microphone setup, making a conversation very clear on their end. I walked through the wind and there was little to none wind distortion on the other end. These microphones help isolate the outside noises so your voice is the only one that is focused. They work and they work well. • They put in a built-in mute button on the earbuds. Small perks go a long way Jabra, thanks. • One-touch on the earbuds and you got Alexa, Google, or Siri on your end, if you’re connected to your phone. • Sweat and dust resistant. Sweat all you like, these buds will keep going. • One of the best features is the app for these. With the 75t’s app, you can personalize your sound take that fits your comfort. The layout is very user-friendly as you are given a visual graphic display of how much you want to the sound quality to either your right, left or both earbuds. I’m a firm believer in enabling the use of custom sound profiles because only you know what’s best for your hearing. With a lot of customization with this, I’m very happy. • Another cool feature of the app is if you apply your personal sound settings, the earbuds will automatically adapt to what you’re changing in the app. No delay or restarting them. • Sound-wise: One of the best bass levels on the market. If you’re a bass person, you’ll love this in every way. If you’re not then you can just go in the app and reduce it. • The mids and highs are crisp, while the Passive Noise reduction does a respectable job blocking out those outside noises. • Pulling out my earbuds, they automatically stop whatever music I was playing. Quick sensors. • The tap controls are very simple and accurate. The best part for me with this is that you have the option to control the volume controls on the earbuds themselves. No need to go on the phone. Cons and Oks:__________
• The bass. It’s really good but too good. It overpowers the highs and lows of the music to a point it’s always boom, boom, boom. I immediately went to the app and cut down the bass. Sadly the bass power is still there, but defiantly not that significant. For bass needed songs, this an upside, but I’m not a bass person myself. • No built-in noise-canceling software. The Passive Noise reduction works well when the wind is blowing in your face. It does reduce a significant amount of wind resistance but other than that a loud environment will still be a loud environment in the earbuds. • Low water rating. Only sweat resistance so you have to be extra careful when the rain or snow comes into your world. These are great for running, but it’s a turn off knowing that you have to be careful not the get these buds wet. • Bulky in the ear. They are small but I felt these buds look like they’re going to pop out of my ear. Extend the earbuds as Apple did so they can be thin and not look like large jelly beans. • No wireless charging for the case. • You get on average a less full day of battery life. This isn’t the greatest as other reviewers have had worse, so be warned. • There is a tight deal suction with these buds. I have no issue but I know some aren’t a fan of the suction feeling and would like some air coming in. This is especially a must if you’re a runner. • The left earbud can be used independently. The right can but not the left. Jabra states for a software update in 2020, so it’s a wait and sees. • Changing your setting with these buds are not automatic. A couple of times I had to wait for the buds to adapt to the settings I made on the app. This only occurs when they’re significant changes. • I used an iPhone and you can’t call up Siri with these. You have to go to the phone. • Those with large hands may have difficulty using these, because of the size. • I tried connecting my computer and phone at the same time and the buds got a glitch. It’s trying to find what primary use is, and when your phone goes off when you’re watching a YouTube video, it has a hard time to choose which one to give you. • With a small bulky size, numerous times I accidentally press the wrong buttons on the buds. There is a learning curve on where to press. Bottom Line:__________
For the active lifestyle for working out, these are quite good. I couldn’t get them out of my ears unless I physically took them out. Also, I was most impressed with the customization you can do for sound when using the app. To be able to configure the sound experience that fits your needs is spot on, and is something that every headphone needs to provide. With a small design, and great microphone setup, and an excellent battery case, I felt these are earbuds that I can be taken on the go while not making people staring at me (unlike Apple). But still that bass. It’s really good when the music matches it, but very annoying when there is bass in songs that don’t need it. The app does help, but with the price you’re paying you to expect the default sound to be neutral. Also the pricing is up with the big guys (Apple, Samsung, etc) so I expected to get some form of noise-canceling software, but sadly no. In the end, there are decent earbuds but with a mediocre battery life, my expectations were higher given the price. Overall: A decent sound with a strong bass but a battery life nothing to brag about. Hope I was a help to you. Love,

Although the sound quality while listening to music is superb, it is the lack of volume control while wearing only the right earbud that is causing me to give these only two stars. I utilize just the right earbud on a daily basis while working from home. When I receive a phone call, the caller ID voice is so low I can barely hear it. And after the cal connects, if the caller does not speak loud enough I can barely hear him/her as well. Unfortunately, Android has removed the call volume control and placed all volume control in one place. I have all of the volumes to the maximum amount, which does not affect the volume on a phone call at all.

I started out with galaxy buds, specifically for the passthrough feature, as I work in construction and have to be able to hear. The galaxy buds sounded awesome, but the passthrough feature was all but non existent. So I tried a few cheap sets of wireless air pod style buds, but the sound was terrible, and so was battery life. I looked at the jabra elite 65t active, and that's when these popped up. A little more money, but let me tell you, these sound amazing!!! The passthrough feature works fantastic, I can actually listen to music and hear the TV in the background, and the dishwasher running, and my girlfriend telling another work story.... point is I can actually hear when I want to!!! Im using them with a Samsung galaxy s10+, and the jabra sound+ app (which is nicer than the galaxy buds app IMO), audio sounds crisp and clear, LOTS OF BASS, but that can be fixed in the app. Nice sleek design, comfortable in the ears, fairly small case would fit better in a backpack or coat pocket vs pants pocket.

I am surprised that headphones of this price do not sound better. The bass is weak, and I have to raise the volume on my phone to hear decently. Meanwhile I had an old pair of AirPods that I got rid of because I wanted to substitute it with these pair of earbuds and the sound quality was better on the AirPods. I was willing to make a bit of a sacrifice on this issue however call quality suffers. Again the sound is weak and I can barely hear the recipient and as of late all of a sudden the person on the other end has a hard time hearing me. Another issue I'm having is the left ear bud has a hissing noise during calls and music playback when above a certain percentage whereas the right earbud sounds just fine. I am not sure if this is a quality control issues and these headphones were rushed to market but as mentioned before, for this price range I expect better. I guess it may depend on which earbuds you receive as others are raving about them.

They are for phone/ tablet use exclusively. Don't bother if you're hoping for something to use with your computer. I am on calls through my laptop roughly 50-75% of my day, and over the last weeks trying to use these ear buds, i have had to resort to backup wired headphones on more than half of my calls because they will just randomly drop the connection to the laptop right in the middle of the call. I've tried fiddling with the system preferences, and the ear buds, and read the manual several times over, and there doesn't seem to be a fix for this. Bluetooth is highly unreliable technology, and these ear buds seem to be even less reliable than average (compared to wireless keyboards, mice, etc.)
Of course, now the return window is over, and I am out almost $200 for something that is definitely more trouble than it is worth.

I have my Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones for travel or more stationary scenarios, so I was looking for a wireless pair of headphones that would fit my high impact workouts and my running routine.

While they do not have active noise cancelling like the Sony's, they are perfect for blocking out the majority of distracting noises. The fit is exceptional, and they're so lightweight and locked in, I simply could not knock them loose (I even subjected them to some light sparring at my MMA gym). No issues with connectivity - I was able to fill up my water bottle from over 100 feet away with no issues multiple times.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-17,I'd give them 6 stars if I could,"I have had a bunch of wireless ear buds over the years, almost all on the expensive side of the spectrum ($250+). Bragi, Sennheiser, Bang & Olefsun among a few others. The 75t's put them all to shame in almost every category. They're the best true wireless ear buds I've found and it's not even close. I've only had them for a few days and haven't had to test the battery life just yet, so I won't comment on that. But in every other way these are damn near perfect. Pros:
- First and foremost: INCREDIBLE connectivity. I haven't experienced a single dropout with these yet, either from the device or between left and right. I live and commute in NYC and there are places where other more expensive bluetooth sets were simply unusable because of all the interference. For the most part you would expect a dropout at least every few minutes just walking down the street. None of that with these. I've seen plenty of other sets advertise this kind of connectivity but these are the first that truly deliver on it. - They are the smallest and lightest pair I've ever seen with an incredibly thin profile. They're almost invisible from the front when you have them in. - Even though they're small they have a really great fit. I can't imagine them falling out and yet they're still incredibly comfortable. You notice the first time you take them out that you have to really PULL them which gives you confidence they're not going to fall out on their own. - There's no active noise cancellation, but you don't miss it. The tight fit shuts out noise almost perfectly. And the lack of noise cancelling software running means increased battery life. - Sound quality is exceptional and the app-based EQ is great to fine tune for music or speech. I don't notice any difference in the sound quality between these and pairs that cost twice as much although I suppose some audiophiles might quibble. But if that's your thing you probably aren't using bluetooth headsets. I don't quite understand the other reviews complaining that the bass is overpowering. Even in default mode I think it's great and you can easily bring it down with the EQ.
- Microphone is also as good as I've ever found. On calls people have no idea I'm on bluetooth and the Hearthrough transparency feature is much clearer than similar features I've used in more expensive sets. You can even adjust the level with the app which is handy since you might want more or less transparency say in the office versus on the street. - The controls on the buds are mechanical instead of touch-sensitive like on most more expensive models, and while that does pose something to potentially malfunction down the line, I actually prefer it as the touch sensitive controls on other sets I've had were always very finicky, often making me have to tap them multiple times to get any response which also made multi-tap functions next to impossible. With these you just click and everything works as advertised. - The battery level LED indicators are a great feature to quickly see if you're running low on either the buds or the charger with a quick flip of the lid. - The app is fantastic, showing battery life for the buds and charging case, enabling audio customization, microphone sensitivity, and even a GPS locator (I haven't tested if this will find one of the buds or the case separately but it's still a nice feature in case you ever misplace the set)
Cons:
- Honestly, I can't think of any. If they could develop a more reliable touch-sensitive control and replace the mechanical ones I guess that would be nice, although probably more expensive. Bottom Line:
If you're in the market, these are the buds to buy. They easily surpass $300+ sets across the board.

I have to believe that’s unusual. For the rest of us, here’s a review that is balanced and fair. It’s laughable to read some reviews where some people are so utterly disgusted with a product. It’s never, ever that bad. Some people are just mad at life and if the ear pods don’t make you a sandwich, they’re rated as trash. I currently have the AirPods Pro and the Jabra 75t. I’ve recently tried and returned the Power Beats Pro and the Sennheiser Momentum 2’s. By the way, if you make phone calls, avoid the Sennheiser’s. Unbelievable, phenomenally good sound quality, but mostly unusable for calls due to their awkward mic placement. And they’re $320 with tax. Now for the Jabra’s. These fit me far better than any I’ve tried. Tight and they fill your ear, but not uncomfortably so. These create a great seal even without ANC. The AirPods Pro are fantastic, but I happen to have trouble keeping the left one in my ear if I’m at all active, walking or running, regardless of the adjustable earpiece size. That’s a me problem, not Apple’s. The Jabra’s stay in, create a nice seal, require little to no adjusting while active and sound great. Don’t let the naysayers scare you off, these are a solid pick and customizable with the EQ in the app to help zero in on just about any sound preference. For me, fit is critical, a close second is the ability to tweak the sound, then call quality and finally, compatibility with connecting with my iPhone and ease of use. The Jabra’s have plenty of bass, maybe a bit too much for some out of the box, but a small tweak of the EQ should fix it. The low, mid and high ranges aren’t Sennheiser quality, not should they be at $179. Music is crisp, rich and deep. From 80’s metal to Maroon 5, to jazz, I ran through my library and was very impressed and pleased with what I heard. Call quality. Not quite as sharp and clear as the AirPods Pro, but awfully close. The AirPods may slightly edge out Jabra in overall comfort and I’d say there’s definitely a bit more of a “feel like I have cotton stuffed in my ears” with the Jabra’s due to the tighter seal and design. The case size is perfect, couldn’t be better, compact and right on the money. Battery life, so far is great. I’d recommend you give these a shot. If you’re like me and struggle with the AirPods Pro staying in your ears, these won’t disappoint.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The Jabras are clearly better quality in terms of build and sound over cheaper true wireless earbuds I've owned. The case is compact and the hinge has a really nice feel to it (I know that's kind of a weird thing to point out). For music and podcasts these are perfect. From a non-audiophile's perspective the sound is pretty well balanced with strong bass, clear highs, and strong mids that aren't muddled. The smartphone software equalizer is pretty nice, but only offers a few inflection points. Useful but not impressive. These are also very comfortable and generally stay in my ear. I get a little worried running in them but they've never fallen out. That was my biggest fear getting expensive earbuds. But I often wear them for hours at a time with no issue. They do have Android Assistant integration but I haven't really figured out how to utilize that too much. I do miss my Google wired earbuds with the assistant button built in. But I can't really fault these for not being as seamless as a Google product. I do have a few issues. Primarily call volume can be a little low. I'm not really sure why this is the case, but I have noticed that sometimes I switch to my handset because I just can't hear the person on the line too well. I know there's a ton of variables at play here, but I've never had this problem with wired earbuds or the handset. I wish I could overboost the call volume somehow. And my BIGGEST complaint is that often the earbud just does not charge in the case. I have had problems where I have the charging case plugged in, and put my earbuds in overnight, and in the morning they're not charged. I've put the earbud in, seen the red light blink indicating it's charging, and STILL have it not charge. So that gets really annoying. Overall these are really nice and I use them daily.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-03,"Great sound quality, fit, and ease-of-use features. AMAZING battery life!","* TLDR *
Sleek looking pair of buds with nice compact charging case. App downloaded, immediately paired the buds, ran updates, and they are great! I had to swap out the gels for a different size, but three sizes were included. Sound quality is fantastic, great range, battery life is unmatched from every other wireless bud I've owned. The feature set is more significant than anything I've had, not sure if they are common in their price range. The app is intuitive and has anything you'd need, and the in-app quick start guide was a quick 2 minute read, and enough to get a handle on which bud did what and how within a couple of minutes. After using these, I would have EASILY paid $300 for them. Would I have been prepared to do that before using them? Probably not. * Long-winded *
Coming from wireless buds that were in the sub $50 range, I feel like I'm seeing fire for the first time. Outside of the incredible sound quality and range on these things, little convenience tweaks that will make ease of use so simple. If I pull a bud out of an ear, it pauses playback. Or I can press a button and hear what's around me and not the phone audio. Phone App: configuration profiles to quickly adjust bulk settings on the fly with one tap. They are also in the persistent tray notification on downslide (Android 10). You can tell they really put work into the app to make it easy to use for people of all technical levels. I have a few nit-picky things and quick settings that may annoy me over time, but nothing worth noting (except at the end) - I'm sure this is the case with everyone and every app, because, humans. It does have a lot of quick options that reduce taps and repetitive actions, love that. Some sort of battery or usage metrics would be fun to see if only to see/send telemetry on battery usage. Sound quality: phenomenal, about on par with my over-ear $100-200 gaming headsets. Blown away that they were able to pack this amount of punch and battery life into such a small and comfortable in-ear. Noise cancellation: amazing (post gel switch)! I can't hear myself typing this review on a loud keyboard. Range: these have been great so far! I had my phone charging in my office and went down the hall into another room I bounce between at work, and not one bit of drop out, latency, or quality distortion. The same distance for an EarForce 450 would cause dropouts or complete loss if the door in that room were closed, or another person with a wireless headset was in there. Battery Life: A++! The test: 60 min album (Illenium: Ascend), within 1 meter during 95% of playback, EQ at bass boost, volume at 90% (occasionally 100%), HearThrough disabled. Self-reported remaining battery 60 minutes of playback: 100%. THAT IS BONKERS!! Maybe it drops in increments of 10% or something, but a solid hour of basically max playback and not a flinch. Based on my experience, it will last a lot longer than the quoted 7.5 hours on a full charge. With the nature of batteries, this will obvi change over time. ++ UPDATE: after 90 minutes of Ascend album looping, I'm at 95% (so it appears 5% increments). During the last 30 minutes, I had HearThrough on. I assume that uses more battery to turn the mics hot. Fit: as mentioned, had to swap gel, no biggie. I haven't gone running with them yet, but walking around and up and down the stairs, etc. - they are solid in-ear and super snug. Wearing for two hours now, no discomfort. Assistant: I haven't had much of a chance to use the assistant tie in, in the real world, but the selection of phone vs. Alexa was easy and upfront. Based on having conversations with people, with earbuds in, and using HearThrough only for that -- I'm sure the assistant will have no problem hearing commands. Saying ""Hey Google"" was an immediate wake response, didn't have a problem with wake or with command. Double-press right bud worked great, immediately playback resume. Assistance volume was very low, but I'm sure that's an on-phone setting in the Android mixer. Love the idea of HearThrough. Some of my gaming headsets and helps big time with communicating and not having to remove the device, it'll be especially helpful on public transit on new routes or delays on things. Constructive feedback: I was trying to pause music and turn on HearThrough at the same time. Pressing the button on both buds at the same time, it shuts them both off immediately. An option in the app to pause music if HearThrough is activated via bud (instead of mute, or maybe a choice between the two) would be excellent! Ideally, I'd like to with one button push: pause music and allow HearThrough. When disabled again, auto-start playback. I'll be sure to update this review in a month if anything changes.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

If I put my earbuds in the charging case for 24 hours, or more, my right earbud will charge but the both the charging case and the left earbud will be dead.

I ride mountain bikes and jog in the hills and I wanted to hear my surroundings for safety. FAIL. This product is a full earbud so the earpiece itself blocks most outside sound out. It relies on an external microphone to listen and return the outside sound back into the earbud. First, the ""Hear Through"" feature is very selective on what frequencies pass thru to your ears. Higher frequencies seem overwhelming, but lower frequencies don't seem to show up. But the biggest problem is the wind noise!! Any movement over a slow walk and these earbuds pick up wind noise that all but drown out any music playing, let alone hearing any of your surroundings. This feature renders these expensive earbuds useless. Oh, and don't get me started with the quirky app. It's ridiculously slow to react and most of the time didn't work at all. Pros: good fit in my ears, seemed like a nice product with a good feel. Sound was decent. However, as an audio nut, I found it a bit fatiguing after a few songs, even after adjusting the EQ.

I lost it and so recently I was in the market for a new pair of truly wireless earbuds. I was somewhat biased towards buying this model because of my experience with the elite active 65t but I thoroughly read and watched countless reviews / comparisons and ended up getting this one out of all the competition. Here's my thoughts:
1. Very secure fit. Small and subtle. (Note: Not as secure feeling as the elite active 65t but still feel quite secure in the ear canal)
2. IMO, the most stylish and good looking pair of truly wireless earbuds out there. 3. The case is on of the best, if no the best out there. Super small, compact and easy to open / close. Fits in your pocket together with your phone, no problems. 4. Battery life is AWESOME. A big improvement over the 65ts and I believe second best in the industry right now. 5. Connectivity is great. As some reviewers have found, you sometimes lose connection on the left earbud for like a micro-second every once per day but that's it. Otherwise perfect. 6. Music is fantastic. Some reviewers have found the bass to be too much but I love it. If you want to get in the zone, these are the earbuds to go for! Finally a big note that not many reviewers consider but I think it's so important: Physical buttons! You can control volume, call answering, hear through, song skipping, etc with physical buttons on the earbuds, something which other earbuds like the Airpods pro do not allow!

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-12-12,More Battery Life And Bass With No Tradeoffs,"Technical Note: The 75t uses BLE as well as the Bluetooth standard for connection, you want to use BLE as this extends the battery life with the only tradeoff being distance from the transmission device has to be shorter. In some phones, you have to pair twice to ensure you get the BLE connection as well as the standard. I own the old 65t, and I consider that pair to be fantastic. However, being offered these, I was surprised to notice how little has changed in the physical design. The fit is the same, the profile is a bit smaller, but this is not notably different. The software interface remains the same solid UI without much problems. All of the difference is within. As opposed to the 65t, the 75t gets at least 3 more hours of battery life (I was averaging 7 hours under real continuous playing conditions), a better bass profile which does mean that you need to rethink your equalization, and the charging to fast use gives you more time for less charging. These fit better than the Jaybird Vistas as Jabra decided to keep doing everything right that they had been doing. The Jaybird and Jabra brands run neck-to-neck in the competition for the best pair of general consumer earbuds, but right now, Jabra's offering is the best fitting brand with improvements to performance that buying these should be a no-brainer if you are in the market for them. I think the only difference that gives Jaybird's an advantage is that the Jaybird's tend to have better water protection than the Jabra's, but this Jabra 75t is all around an excellent choice.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-03,Great pair of wireless buds,"I don't write many reviews unless I feel something really deserves it, so here we go! First off I moved from the Jabra Active 65t's and most of the issues/gripes I had with the 65t's look to be resolved with the 75t's. I'll cover the gripes/improvements, then some pros and cons. Gripe Number 1: The charging case
The charging case on the 65t's was this weird type of case where you had to squeeze the side or the center to open them, not a pain, just different. The 75t's have that fixed, it's an easy open magnetic case, love the fact it's magnetic and a strong one at that. Gripe Number 2: Earbuds in the case
The 65t's just kind of sat in the case, there was no positive engagement and you had to rely on a light to tell you if they were connected, sometimes if I was in a hurry and I didn't confirm the buds were properly inserted they wouldn't charge, same goes if I needed to open them in a hurry the buds would sometimes pop out and fall on the ground. The 75t's are magnetically connected, this is friggin fantastic! Such an improvement, can't say how much I love this as they stay in there, in fact the magnet is so strong that you have to be intentional to get them out. Gripe Number 3: The on earbud buttons
I found the 65t's button on the earbuds themselves to be a bit stiff/hard to press and having additional pressure on my ear was a tad uncomfortable. The 75t's have much more sensitive buttons, and I love that they are single buttons, yes there are different combinations to remember but I feel having softer buttons is a huge plus. On to the PRO's! The sound:
I think the sound on these is definitely a tad better that the 65t's, there is a lot more bass, and I do mean A LOT. In fact I need to turn down the bass a little through the Jabra app, I guess you could say too much bass is a negative, but I enjoy hearing the lower end on all my songs. Battery life:
I am getting an average 7.25 hours using middle volume, if I keep the volume high, the run time is a little lower, roughly 6.75 hours. One thing I haven't tested is run time without using the EQ in the app, I'm sure if I left the EQ as default or flat I could squeeze a tad more out? Also the case packs a lot more backup charge than the 65t's, overall a huge jump from the 65t's. Hear through:
One of my favorite features is hear through...I can't rave enough about it as I use these primarily in an office setting and not having to take them out to hear co-workers or have conversations is a huge plus for me. The Case:
Fantastic improvements on the case, love that it's magnetic, magnetic earbuds and strong ones at that, no more lost earbuds. Charge port:
USB-C! Being that the industry is making a change to USB-C it's nice to have one less cable to support. To the CON's! The Bass:
One could say the bass is a tad to strong? However I rather enjoy it, I'm a big over the head, can wearing guy so getting a little more bass out of my on the go headphones is a rather nice plus, but some could be turned away. Ear bud magnets:
The magnets holding these little guys in are strong, and with the ear buds being tiny they can be difficult to get them out. The other side of this is they won't be easily lost, so again choose your battles. Overall thoughts:
I love the fact you get so much better battery life (and case battery too), strong bass, and great sound in such a tiny profile. Not to smash on the Air-pods, but these 75t's stay in my ears, I don't have a fear of them falling out during workouts, and they fit just as snugly (heck if not better) as the 65t's. I'm excited to use these in the warmer months on my longer bike rides. I think just the extra battery life these things pack to last me the work day and not need to do a mid day charge is a huge win and a reason to purchase and or upgrade.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

As a personal trainer and avid workout enthusiast, I selected these from online reviews. I needed something I can train and sweat in, as well as drown out background noise when it’s time to meditate and rest. This is especially important as I train and live in the heart of New York City, and quiet time is a luxury hard to come by. Something unique is that whenever I get new tech, gear, etc. my clients always ask and use my reviews as feedback to follow suit for a better fitness experience and thus a better holistic wellness experience. Here are my pros and cons:
Pros:
-Earbuds are snug. They have to be for noise isolation. It’s a weird feeling at first and one can become very conscious of the sounds of your inner ear— think covering your ears or being underwater. With sound on however, it is hardly noticeable. -Sound through is cool, but not great. I imagine it’s the same as hearing aide technology. Hopefully it can be better improved, but all in all, it is a cool feature in case you need to listen to your surroundings. -Music quality is great! Some people mentioned the bass being too much (and I don’t like bass), but I don’t mind it. I even lowered it in the app and still found my music enjoyable. (This was a big factor in selecting if I would purchase or not.) -Functionality takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it all makes sense. With anything it takes a little practice. Cons:
Time for the bad.. and this a big one, because I’m experiencing similar things to other reviewers. From day 1, my left earbud keeps dropping the sound and dropping calls. When it works it’s fine, but there is definitely something wrong with my left earbud. This is a shame because it doesn’t seem worth the investment. For that I say, “buyer beware.” Today on my walk, I had to check on the left bud because it dropped or didn’t work after 1 minute of putting them in. I tried putting them both in the recharging case multiple times, I checked my Bluetooth, ... I did everything I could. I’m very disappointed by this especially because I was looking forward to this purchase. It is a shame. I would appreciate Jabara contacting me about this matter and letting me know what my next steps should be.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-01-29,Earbuds popped out of my ears and random audio disconnects,"I had purchased the Elite Active 65t's right before the 75t's came out. I have been very happy with the 65t's, but I was curious what improvements had been made so I decided to buy the 75t's to see how they compare. Here are the improvements I saw, in comparison to the 65t's:
Plusses:
* Strong bass sound
* Longer battery life
* No video and audio syncing issue (this is probably my biggest pet peeve with the 65t's, but I don't use them for this purpose very often)
* Smaller size - both earbuds and case
But there are two major downsides. Negatives:
* Earbuds can pop out of ears when doing physical activity
* Connectivity was lost on several occasions. These two negatives are showstoppers. For me, the earbuds popped off on multiple occasions when I was lifting weights. You definitely do not want to be distracted with your earbuds flying around the gym in the middle of a rep. This never happened to me in all the time I used my 65t's. Also, when they didn't come off, there was still that feeling that they weren't completely secure in my ears - I kept playing around with them to adjust the fit. So I ended up doing an experiment: I put each set of earbuds in my ear and then moved my mouth and jumped around to see if I could loosen the earbuds from my ears. I was able to get the 75t's out within a few seconds just from moving my mouth around. I could not get the 65t's out though, no matter what I did. They're that good at staying in your ears. By the way, the issue was not the earbud tip because I tried all sizes and even tried to use the same one provided with the 65t's. Regardless, they still popped out. The connectivity issue happened to me several times in the middle of a run. Many times, the audio would cut in and out. And a couple of times, the audio completely disconnected. This happened to me one time in the middle of a run. When you're in that running zone high, you don't want to have to stop and deal with restarting your earbuds. Also, I had updated the firmware and Jabra sound app to the latest versions so that was not the issue. Again, I experienced none of these problems with the 65t's. I really wanted to keep the 75t's due to the plusses I noted above - in particular, the quality of the sound is a huge improvement. But it's really annoying to have wireless earbuds that pop out of your ears and to have the audio randomly disconnect, especially during a run. So in the end, I returned them and now I'm back to using my 65t's.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-12-03,TINY!,"UPDATE: have been super happy with these but today, the app said the case was at 0% charge (even though the earbuds were at 100%). After plugging in the case for 5 minutes and then using the buds, the app said the case was back to 100% (not physically possible for a full charge from 0% in 5 minutes). Will keep an eye on this - the whole point of the app is being able to tell when the case needs charging. I've been using the Zolo Liberty Upgraded (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GKHYVM8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) earbuds for about 10 months and I love them. I got the Jabra's because the call quality on the Zolo isn't the best. So. These are SMALLLLLLLLLLL. Surprisingly small. Or maybe I have fat sausage fingers? The case is really small, which is nice but also makes me worry about losing it. The earbuds themselves are REALLY small; by removing that microphone wing/stem from the design (like the 65t), it's harder for me to put them into my ears. Once they're in, they're great but if I try to push them back in a little, I end up hitting the button. There's almost zero border between the edge of the bud and the button. Sound-wise, they're pretty amazing - super deep bass, super crisp highs, just fantastic. The Jabra app allows you to customize the sound a bit; there are 6 presets that aren't very nuanced. If you like to really fiddle with your sound, you're better off using the equalizer in your music app (I use PowerAmp on Android, my favorite for nearly 10 years now). Overall, I'd say they're worth the money. ***When I got them, they weren't set to max volume; you HAVE to raise the volume on the right ear bud itself, you can't even do it in the app. Personally, I set the buds to max volume and manage it on my phone instead.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

• constantly falls out when you move
• insufficient battery life

Improvements over Jabra's previous gen 65t:

• increased comfort
• lightweight; improved secure fit
• stronger battery life
• seamless magnetic snap-in case 🙌
• looks much better
• hear-through has higher sensitivity
• hear-through strength is now adjustable
Regressions from 65t:

• hear-through feature sounds less natural

The sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, and call quality were all fantastic. However, 3 weeks ago I started experiencing an issue where there was an audio imbalance between the left and right earbuds. The right earbud would get quieter and quieter over time until you couldn't hear anything unless the volume was turned all the way up. This of course would make the left unusable because the volume would be so loud it would blow out my eardrum if I left it in. I did extensive troubleshooting on my own and the issue did not get any better, so I opened a support case with Jabra. After a few conversation over the course of a week, they sent my case to Tier 2 support. I didn't hear from them for about a week, when they finally reached out and told me there was a firmware update addressing my issue. I updated the firmware on my earbuds and they were fine for a day before the issue returned. I updated Jabra on the issue and asked about a replacement set and referenced the warranty, but have not heard anything back from them since.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2020-02-18,AUDIO IS JUNK! Going back to the 65t,"Wow wow wow! These are Trash compared to the 65ts. Before buying the 75ts I tried my dad's 65ts. I was afraid that they wouldnt sound as good as my wired headphones when listeng to music. But I was very impressed and decided to try out the new 75ts. Unfortunately once I got them I was extremely disappointed. First the positives:
I love the small case with the magnetic snaps, I love the USB-C, I love the smaller size and the longer battery life. And the pass-through sounds MUCH clearer than the 65ts. (side note, Jabra please double the available gain on the pass-through, it really needs a boost)
The bad:
I don't like the way the 75ts fit in my ears. The 65ts twist in and lock into the shape of my ears. They fit perfect! When I try to put in the 75ts I have a difficult time deciding if they are properly in place. They shake out a little easier too. The Big bad... I am an audiophile and believe I have fairly good hearing across all frequencies. It seems someone let a bass head with no top end hearing design these new buds. The bass is completely over driven and makes the entire low end sound like mud. If I turn down the bass in the equalizer all I get is quieter mud. The highs are also pushed too high and loose all their clarity. I couldn't believe it. All these great new features but junk audio! All the features in the world can't sell me on a pair of headphones that sound bad. Man did they screw these things up! Maybe if you never use them for music you won't be bothered. I tried my dad's 65ts again and man do they sound amazing! I could do with a tad more bass, I do love bass so long as it's clean, but the 65ts have enough to satisfy.

Reason enough to get these. Added some pictures so you can see the size difference between the 65t and the 75t. Not an audiophile by any means but I still like the sound these have. Maybe a little quieter than the 65t but more clearer. The new controls are a bit unorthodox but like any new tech there is a learning curve. They did away with the up down button on the left ear bud and now you have to learn a series of button clicks on each bud which is good and bad. The best part you can now turn on passive hearing from the earbud. No need to pull out your phone and bring up the app.
The new case is way smaller and has a more ergonomic design. Sits upright instead of on its side. The buds stay in place with magnets instead of the lid acting as the place holder. It still has an LED to let you know its charging or updating but now the app/notification area tells you how much power is left in the case and the earbuds. Now the bad is the Jabra Customer Service and not their product. I preordered these more than a month before their release but never received them and couldn't get a date from them when I did get a response so I had to cancel and go to the local Best Buy to get them on 12/3.

However, the bass is a notch up from the Soundcore and Sony offerings. The jabras really bang! Volume level on the Jabras is the loudest of the 3... being a tick louder. The battery life of the Jabras is better than the Sonys but not quite as good as the Soundcore buds. It's not far off though. The hear through, if on, probably takes off an hour or so.

Plus they 75t's would stop playing music or podcast, even though my phone showing my music or podcast was still playing. To fix that, I had to remove them, place them back into the case and put back into my ear. VERY ANNOYING!

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-03-19,OUTSTANDING upgrade from Elite 65t! Worth the price...,"Purchased these to replace my original Elite 65t buds (which I love). After trying a dozen high end wireless buds I settled on the 65's for the comfort, battery, and quailty! When I saw my beloved buds had an upgraded version, I did NOT hesitate and I am glad I bought them! Set up is straight forward, pair with phone and they work! They use the same Sound+ app from Jabra. The say they reduced the size by 20% and theres no doubt, they actually feel like they shrunk them by 50%... They seem ti fit a little deeper into my ear so they are a little less obvious compared to the 65t. They also offer the same comfort as their predecessors, I can wear them all day long and forget they are in my ears - trying doing that with ipods! They are also just as secure, I have not once found myself trying to adjust or reseat them? (tip- nobodies ear canals are the same left/right, my left is larger than my right. so on the left bud I have the medium silicone and on the right I have the small one. So play with the sizes and find something that works - it also doubles the longevity of the silicones if your only using 1 of each). The best thing is they have a longer battery life, I can get through an entire work day (shutting them off at coffee and lunch only) listening to music and taking calls. The carry case has also been redesigned which is a huge upgrade! I found the 65t case to be a bit awkward or finicky to open; not these, the lid is magnetic and super easy to open! They also added magnets to the inside, so you dont have to worry about the buds sitting in the case in the correct position. When you get the bud near the hole it sits in the magnet actually pulls it from you finger tips and snaps them in place and they are firmly held in place (even when flipped upside down with the cover open)
As for sound, they have the same quality sound as the 65t but with a little more bass, the Sound app allows you to fine tune some of the settings. again your looking at ear buds - dont expect to get the same sound your going to get from a huge set of cans! If your going for size, duration, and convenience then this is it! Sound quality is EXCELLENT for a true wireless earbud. They have also added new button features to the buds them self (maybe its the firmware?) either way for example - you can now press the left ear button to switch off or on the Hearthrough feature, etc. FYI - out of the box there was a firmware update (though I dont know what it did)
PROS:
very light
very very comfortable
tiny (especially compared to the 65's)
long battery life
case is a charger
new improved carry case (its significantly smaller) also added magnets
quality sound
quality build/feel
CONS:
no wireless charging
if you want only one earbud in; you can ONLY use the right one!? Maybe the 85t will allow you choose either ear? the price! (BUT I believe they are worth it)

First of the earbuds are really great sounds quality and have nice bass and it can be adjusted to anybody's amount you want with the app. With the earbuds in you can't ear much of anything around you so that's a plus. The calls ppl say they can hear you ok and clear. The case is nice and small and flat on the bottom for putting on a surface to keep it up right. Battery life couldn't be much better they go a long time. They stay in ear and are tight in there never have to worry about them falling out. They feel comfortable in ear as well and you can wear for long periods of time and have no hurting. Cons
The only cons is that only the right earbud is able to be used separate b from one another. Then I have noticed that with a phone say if you have phone on pocket and not in plan sight the Bluetooth connection cuts out allot and Skip's idk if it is because I have a case on my phone that makes it worse but shouldn't be the phone as it if a Samsung note 10+. Only other thing to is some times the left ear bud will cut off and only way I've found to get it to reset and reconnect is to put it in the case and let it go red then pull it out again and it comes back on. Over all I'm very happy with these and if you are in it for sound quality these do really good for that I'd give the sound a 10",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-02-18,"Nice sound, good fit & battery life....unfortunately left ear bud drops.","Have had many different TWS bluetooth ear buds the past couple years, as well as too many bluetooth to 3.5mm stereo receivers (and dozens of in ear/canal headphones). I'll confess to being somewhat of a in ear/canal headphone junkie. Had high hopes for the Jabra 75t. Unfortunately these are being returned, as they have the left in ear piece drop out issue that many other users seem to be experiencing. I've updated firmware through the app twice as the software from Jabra comes out, but this issue still present. Connecting to an iPhone iOS 13.x (always latest available). Don't have this drop out problem with other setups. The 75t sound signature is nice, very warm and controlled, but still with plenty of mid and upper range. The app helps with EQ to dial in the sound style you like. Battery life is better than I need, didn't go for detailed testing on this feature, but easily lasts longer than my listening sessions, 3-4 hours at a time. For talking, the microphone/noise cancellation works well, but can't best the Apple Powerbeats Pro. Many times when using the 75t, the person on the other end complains they can't hear my voice well, like it's distant, as compared to the same environment with the Apple Powerbeats Pro. I didn't really buy these for the mic feature, mainly for the sound isolation and listening to music....my comments just to compare mics on a TWS set I have in a similar price range. Fit is awesome. The Jabra 75t is the best of any TWS bluetooth in ear I've tried, ear hook or no ear hook design. Noise isolation is also very good, easy to seal in your ear. When sealed, you can use a low volume and still have a little feedback from the surrounding environment, but with volume levels approaching half way, outside noise is easily overpowered. My use the past couple weeks has been walking or typical indoor around the house. Most in ear buds (even those with ear hooks, or wired solutions) I have to constantly readjust, or they simply fall out or lose the seal. Not the 75t. Only need to adjust every half hour or so. Hopefully the left ear bud drop out issue will get solved.....the fit and sound signature was such that these could have been my only TWS solution.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I was very impressed with the sound, especially the bass for the earlier set, and these are just as amazing. I would have expected a known sound maker brand to have buds of this quality on the high end. Maybe this is one of those brands known only to audiophiles, but even if not it should be soon. Main difference between old and newer models, is the charging case, it holds a larger charge, I'm not sure the old one had much battery at all, but this set has a nice feature there. High quality construction and materials makes for very nice sound quality with the design. Come with different ear inserts for the various sizes for a good fit, just like my other set. I always have to include this disclaimer though on my audio reviews. I hear pretty good for my age, but it's a known fact people over 50 don't hear the high notes as well as teens and those in their 20's and 30's. I think they list the testing specs on their site, and it seems to be accurate on the low range, but since I probably don't hear the highest notes, I can't really test that part well. Older people tend to hear bass much better than when younger, so that part is excellent. I like what I hear on the high end too, but might be missing something on a song with very high frequency sounds.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-03-27,Falls Short of Good,"Let me start off by saying that I have had these since mid-December 2019. First set I ordered, the left earbud wasn't working. It probably had something to do with the fact that the right earbud is the master and the left feeds off of the right but regardless I couldn't get it to work together at any range. Amazon thankfully has an extremely smooth product exchange process so I got a functional pair. Jabra put out a tweet or something saying that they would make both earbuds independent in early 2020 and with the active version out now I'd thought it would be done by now. Idk if its because of COVID-19 but it doesn't look like they're gonna deliver on this for a while. The more I use these the more annoying they get. The bluetooth is decently stable but once every other day or so it will start to spazz out between youtube videos or just stop audio entirely. Usually the problem can correct itself in about 20 seconds but sometimes I have to disconnect then reconnect. Then final problem I'm noticing recently is that the earbuds don't hold 7.5 hours as promised. At about 25% or even less volume while connected to my macbook pro they're getting like 5 maybe 6 tops. Not a huge difference I know and still probably longer than the airpods pro but one of their key marketing ploys was their long battery life and they just don't last as long as I'd like them to. Oh and passive noise isolation is kind of a joke, they have to be at pretty high volumes to tune out moderate noises. As for positives I will say that the sound quality and bass on these puppies is pretty great and they charge pretty fast, but the more I use them the more I regret not getting airpods pro, sennheiser's or something else.

Well, I bought these for use at work and the gym...but then the quarantine hit, so they've been mostly used at home during me working from home. They are great for conference calls, listening to music, or watching shows while I tune out my child's shows or music. I've honestly only gotten to use them at the gym once, but they worked like champs. The headphones, as well as the charging case, have a great battery life. I charge them like once a week with pretty steady usage. They fit great in my ears and the hear through allows me to participate in conversations without having to take them out of my ears when I'm not listening to anything at a higher volume at the time. The companion app for your phone is AMAZING, and super versatile. It gives you active stats on batter life, allows you to customize the sound, and also has a find your headphones feature. The button press combinations are a bit confusing at first, but are easily sorted after a bit of usage. My only downsides to these are few. First, after a long listening session, the slight pressure used to press the headphone buttons can cause a slight pain to the ear. Second is that none of my old earbud tips really work with these headphones, and by that I mean they can be put on with little problem but they make the headphones stick out of your ears more and disallow you to charge with the aftermarket tips in the charger case. All-in-all I absolutely LOVE these headphones. For transparency's sake, I only gave these 4 stars on noise cancelling because they really aren't noise cancelling headphones.

I was impressed at the claim of 7.5 hours of battery life, and good noise cancellation. I'd had Jabra products in the past, and they always performed well, so I gave these a shot. They work, pretty much, as advertised. The good? They're small, lightweight, and compact. I can wear them for hours without my ears hurting. The sound is excellent. I can hear whispered lines in songs that I couldn't before, even with my computer's headphones. The noise cancelling is enough that I can stand next to the open hood of a semi truck, while it's running, and not have my ears hurt from the sound. An hour's charge brings them to nearly 100%
The bad? Well, it's not bad, but it is a little disappointing. The battery life is about 5.5 hours. I know it says up to 7.5 hours, but I'm not sure how you'd get that. I listen to music or audiobooks, and nothing too loud, so I don't know what causes it to not last over 6 hours. The other problem I'm having with the earbuds is if I want to use speech to text, I can't get the headphones to do that for me. I can tell them ""Ok Google"" and get a response that way, but if I touch the microphone button on my phone, then my phone wants me to talk to it, not through the headphones. Touching the phone is contrary to my job: I drive truck, and I need to be able to control my recording apps without touching the phone. That is possibly a phone problem. All in all, not a bad pair.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,0,2020-03-27,UPDATED: Call audio leaves much to be desired,"For transparency, I currently own the older Jabra 65t Active earbuds and love them. They fit great, are comfortable for long periods of wear, sound great for music and calls - callers can hear me well (although there is no active noise cancellation on the mics so they hear EVERYTHING), and battery life is as advertised. I've been waiting to buy the 75t because I wanted some wireless earbuds that were a bit smaller and mostly wanted to see what the next generation could offer. Overall, I wasn't disappointed. There are many new features - not anything class-elevating - that mostly fixed annoyances with the 65t. Unfortunately, the first day used them (I've only had them for about 4 days now), I noticed the most annoying problem with phone call audio. Callers can hear me just fine, but the audio on my side of the call is HORRIBLE! Primarily, the audio level is very low - enough so that I need to turn the volume up to the highest setting to hear average level audio (I'm not hard of hearing). And either in addition to that or because of that, there is an annoying amount of hiss that accompanies the caller audio. I'm not certain if it's an amplifier gain problem, or bluetooth encoding problem, but the hiss is only there when there is audio (think noise gate). Honestly, it sounds like the decoded audio stream within the headset is not entering the amplifier with enough gain (from a technical perspective). How do I know this isn't just an issue with the phone (Samsung S9)? Because during the call, I switch from the 75t earbuds to the 65t earbuds and the problem goes away. I'm back to beautiful call audio with plenty of volume and no ""amplifier"" noise. I switch back to the 75t in the same call, problem reappears. I'm working with customer service now to understand if there is anything that can be done to clear this. The earbuds were upgraded to new firmware as soon as received them so I can't tell if this is something that changed with the new firmware and there is unfortunately no way to downgrade the firmware to see. If I'm unable to find a resolution, I'll need to consider returning these as I will only use them for media audio and not calls. That could be enough for certain use cases, but it would be annoying to need to switch between earbuds just to get decent call audio quality. I'm hoping the issue can be fixed with software changes and is not a generic design flaw. I'll update this review if I get any decent answers, but for now, it you want Jabra true wireless earbuds and consistent phone audio quality, buy the 65t instead. Updated 3/30/2020:
I've had a few more interactions with Jabra customer Service and unfortunately, according to them, the noise I hear during the phone call is by design and is a result of the low-power design of the earbuds. They gave me some reset options to try on the earbuds that made no difference. What I didn't originally report were some random volume inequality problems between the left and right earbuds during a phone call (media is fine). What was odd about this is that the ""noise"" I hear would actually play at the same volume level on both earbuds, but the call audio would sometimes be louder (more than 50%) in the right earbud. I would have to remove the right earbud forcing the bluetooth connection between the earbuds to pause, reset, or something (the call was still in progress during this process). Replacing the right earbud would apparently reset the connection between the earbuds and the volume would equalize between both. It's unfortunate that call audio quality is apparently being sacrificed for battery performance. I would love to keep my 75t earbuds if the call audio quality was the SAME as the 65t at the expense of battery loss because all of the other features, including media audio quality, are fantastic and worth the higher price. But as Jabra is supposed to be known for fantastic support with phone calls, I can't in my right mind keep the earbuds and put up with annoying call quality (30-40% of my day). I really do think there is an engineering/software resolution to my problem - even if it's something as ""simple"" as providing the ability for me to sacrifice battery for higher audio output (well above the noise floor) on phone calls. But since I can't seem to get past the first line of customer support (I requested my problem be run past an engineer), I decided to return the 75t and continue to use my 65t - which I'm still very happy with.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-02-24,Meh. Don't bother.,"I really like the design aesthetic of the 75t and that's about it. For me, it falls down in several areas:
Size/fit -- The buds are completely insecure in my ears. I have to really restrict head movement and walk with a steady, even stride when wearing these while out-and-about. And don't even bother wearing these while eating...they fall out with every movement of your jaw. So much for listening to a podcast while lunching at work. Audio - The sound is a lot softer/quieter than my other headphones and earbuds, which can make audio really difficult to hear in moderately noisy environments, even with the volume turned all the way up on my phone or laptop. So much for using these on public transit or in windy situations. Calls - The microphones pick up EVERYTHING which makes it difficult to have a conversation if you're outdoors or multi-tasking indoors. And they're completely useless in even slightly breezy environments. While trying to make a call while outside on a nearly windless day, the other person couldn't hear anything but blowing sounds from the breeze while I walked. So much staying connected while on the go. App / features - the ""find my Jabra"" feature in the app is a joke. It's not able to locate your buds in real-time. Instead,it displays their last known location which is based on the last time you tried to locate the buds while you were wearing them. I misplaced my buds for 8+ hours at home one day and was not sure if I'd left them in the office. I tried the ""locate my jabra"" feature and was told their last known location from a week prior when I'd first set them up and paired with my phone. There a few other minor annoyances but just based on the above I would not recommend these if you intend to use while in motion (of any sort) or in moderately noisy environments.

The second set is having the same issues, just without the crackle, and now the volume will go down all the way, on it's own, and they power off frequently. This is not the quality I would expect when paying close to $200 for some ear buds. Jabra is no help either, all they do is recommend you reset them, and then update them with the app. Done that... a few times now, and still having issues. I would also like to point out that the suggested 7.5 hours of battery life is a very generous estimate. Today alone I wore them for less than 4 hours and I received the ""battery low"" prompt... 4 hours surely not 7.5. I would say they last more around 5.5-6 hours...at best. The sound is decent and the app is nice with the EQ and other features, but the quality of the connection and Bluetooth is lackluster at best.

I realize every product has a certain amount of duds, but Jabra's customer service is simply terrible for me to recommend these. Yes, they are smaller than the 65t and I actually think they sound better. Some complain about the bass being too much, but I love bass in my rock music and think it sounds great. I don't love the taps you have to do and miss the rocker switch from my 65ts. They're smaller and less noticeable, though you still get motion noise when exercising which is annoying. The problem I encountered is that they stopped charging on the first day. The case would light up green but the buds were dead. I tried again on other cables and chargers, and did not get them to charge. They're brand new, and yes they made good contact with the case, so I can't explain why they won't charge. I reached out to Jabra and heard nothing for days. I tried again, nothing. The THIRD time I finally got a response, and they literally sent me 3 pages of troubleshooting things to do to reset the case. It was absurd and frankly they should have RMA'd them and sent me a new pair. I had issues with a previous Anker earbud set and Anker simply sent me a new pair, no questions asked. Jabra makes you jump through hoops, if they respond at all. So, 4 stars for the buds (if they work), and 1 star for Jabra's terrible customer service.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2020-02-03,"Amazing sound quality, but not the best device for every situation","Let me start off by saying I’m absolutely floored by the sound quality of these earbuds. I’m sure some will disagree, but I’m more impressed with the sound of Jabra than with Bose and Klipsch. Jabra is the best IMO at providing both rich bass and crisp treble. Headsets are typically one or the other; heavy bass good for hip hop, but poor treble for classical. Or heavy treble good for jazz, but poor bass for dubstep. What about genres like EDM that sound best with both? I listen to a mix of music styles, so I really appreciate Jabra’s ability to handle them all quite well. If you install the app, you can tweak the sound even more by using their equalizer. Listen to a lot of podcasts or audio books? Use the “speech” preset so voices are clearer and less “boomy.” Want more bass or treble? Want smoother or more energized sound? There are options for that, too. Or you can custom adjust the range yourself. The earbuds sit in my ears quite comfortably, and seal tight keeping sound both in and out. So much so that they are nearly as good as earplugs. Which is why Jabra included a HearThrough option that uses a digital technology that brings outside noises in should you wish to. This is good for when you are outside and want to be aware of traffic sounds, or around other people and want to hear what they are saying without removing the buds. In the app, you can adjust the volume of the HearThrough as well as add soundscaping noises to them. Such as pink or white noise, nature sounds (rain, birds, waves, etc.), or ambience like cavern or crowd. This can be calming when at work (assuming earbuds are allowed) or resting. * NOTE: Regarding HearThrough outdoors. Be aware that it picks up the sound of moving air. Whether from your speed or the wind or both. I took these earbuds along with me on a bike ride and found the air noise dreadfully annoying. With HearThrough off, they were fine. But it also meant I had to be more visually aware of my surroundings since I couldn’t hear them. Something to keep in mind if you want to use them while jogging or the like. While these earbuds are good for relaxing, I would not recommend them for sleeping. Not unless you are a back or stomach sleeper. The buds do fit nicely into your ears, but they stick out a bit. So those who sleep on their sides or move around will find them uncomfortable, perhaps painful. Even soft pillows will put pressure on the buds and jab them into your ears, giving a new meaning to the name Jab-ra. (See what I did there?) When using a headset daily, I personally prefer those that sit around the neck and have retractable earbuds. Such as the LG TONE Platinum. This allows me to keep the headphones on me in a resting position without having them in my ears. I can quickly pull them out and put the buds into my ears for an incoming call, or conveniently listen to audio as the need arises. The Jabra Elite 75t Earbuds makes this more difficult. While they are great for when I’m dedicating time to listen—such as doing household chores—they are less convenient when I want to carry them around throughout the day. Plus, they are much easier to lose (since they are so small). There are silicone cases designed for this set (such as ASIN: B083FFBM4J) that have a carabiner you can attach to a belt loop or bag/backpack. That could help the buds be more accessible while with you, but I still envision the process of pulling them out quickly enough for an incoming call to be slow. Just something to keep in mind. Overall, great sound quality, but uncomfortable when lying down. Picks up wind noises outdoors when in HearThrough mode. That said, I find them to be a nice option for the right situations.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-16,Near perfect,"I was looking for a pair of all-purpose true wireless ear buds that could be used for commuting and the gym. My previous pair was the wireless Jaybird X2, that I had a terrible time with -- the fit was poor, especially with the wings! The sound started giving out on one of the two earbuds, and the wire that ran between the buds sometimes loosened the earbud fit with even light activity. Plus, the batter life was so-so, pairing was a pain, and charging was a pain with awkwardly placed micro-USB. After putting up with these for a couple of years, it was time for a change. After doing my research, I settled for the truly wireless Jabra Elite 75t and have had them for around a month and got them for a holiday gift, before the active ones came out. The active ones are submersible, which may be nice for peace of mind, but the IP55 rating of the non-active ones is fine for the gym or in rain. So far, these earbuds have been great! There are only a few minor quirks. Pros:
-The sound's great
-Bluetooth connection to 1-2 devices is seamless (by the time you take them out of the case and put them in, it's connected! So easy compared to my old Jaybird X2s!) -The tactile buttons are great - it's not uncomfortable to push them; light pushes will do
-Hearthrough works very well
-The passive noise cancellation is very good
-The seal's great, and they rarely come loose, even at the gym
-The phonecall quality is great
-The battery life's outstanding
-Indicator LEDs about battery life are intuitive, informative, and non-obtrusive
-The case is small, light, and the earbuds won't fall out accidentally due to magnetic attachments and lid closure
-The buds themselves are also light and compact
Cons:
-With hearthrough activated, you get a slight hissing sound in quieter environments. It's not really noticeable when music is playing, but can be mildly annoying for podcasts and audiobooks
-If hearthrough's activated and nothing's playing, the hearthrough occasionally cuts out, so you hear your surroundings, then not for a second, then hearthrough reactivates
-The left earbud's sound occasionally drops for half a second. This is rare, but regular (every 2-3-ish hours)
-Sometimes the left earbud doesn't connect, and I have to put it back in the case and take it out again to connect it to the master right earbud
There's also a little room for improvement:
-It would be nice if the buds and case could be made to chirp from the app so you can find them more easily if lost
-I'm not sure how water resistant the case is. It doesn't need to be submersible, but an IP55 rating or so would be nice
The cons and places for improvement are minor at the end of the day. Overall, these are light, comfortable, stay in, have great sound and call quality, and are super-convenient. If you're looking for a pair of truly wireless earbuds for all-around use, from commuting to housework to the gym, these are a great choice.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

-USB-C
-Better shaped charging case. -Smaller size earbud. Cons:
-Noise cancellation isn't as good. -Left ear randomly cuts out for a second or two. -Manual power on/off is unresponsive. -Battery drains significantly faster than the 65T. -Case doesn't appear to charge the bus quickly, even while plugged in. -New earbud controls leave a lot to be desired and are often confusing.

By comparison the apple Air Pods Pro are well worth the extra money in my opinion. Sound quality is amazing, as is call quality. Transparency mode is far superior, with the Jabra Elite 75t sounding like it was amplification through an old radio. Airpods sound like you do not have them in. The addition of active noise cancellation that the Jabras don't have is a big plus, and also worth it.

1. Only headphone I found that can simultaneously connect to 2 phones without having to pair again each time. Connection is seamless. Goes between phone calls, music etc. and for 2 phone without any issues
2. Mute and unmute calls from the headset without handling the phone...
3. Sound quality is great. The app has various presets or can customize the levels
Cons:
1. Expensive...
2. Call quality is just ok. Caller on the other side complains of background noise. Would expect better noise reduction for top of the line headset
3. Heavy. Hurts after half hour of wearing. The magnet parts caused cheffing inside the ears. Not comfortable in any of the three earbuds. 4. The hear through feature is weird. It allows outside noise through but creates a weird ambience. Similar sensation when ears are covered with hands
5. microphone is not very generous. Need to be very still when on the phone. Otherwise people complained my voice sounds far away. Tried all of the different earbuds but the issue persists
6. The charging case collecting some kind of a white residue. Does not wipe off... not sure how to clean it
Overall disappointing for the amount it costs. Other top line products are far more comfortable and lightweight. Sound quality and conversation quality is better in most other headphones in the market, even some cheaper ones. I will use it for the multi point connection because it is a must have for me and I have not found any other product in the market as good as the Jabra.

I bought the 75T thinking they would be a good upgrade. The sound IS an upgrade, they sound pretty good; a bit more bass and clarity of the 65T, from what I can tell. The controls are a definite downgrade. The rocker on the left ear of the 65T is a FAR superior control than the pushbuttons of the 75T. Not sure why Jabra decided to change what was GOOD without adding any features. I especially hate the volume controls. Previous controls on the 65T used the rocker on the left ear so you can turn sound up or down in increments. On the 75T you press and hold the left ear to turn down or right ear to turn up. The longer you press the more the volume changes. So if you just want to step the volume up or down one notch, you're WAY better off using the phone controls. It's impossible to change the sound ""just a little."" I've kept the 75T for now trying to get ""used"" to the controls. The sound improvement makes me keep them. The TERRIFIC improvements to the case (magnetic on the 75T) is definitely a plus if you are ever holding the case anything but upright. Battery life is so good that I don't even worry about it...but the way I used the 65T it was never an actual concern. Jabra - You made a nice headset taking forward steps in design and sound. You made a backward step in functionality in my book. Bring back the rocker. Of small consequence - one activity I use the headphones during is washing the car. This is a 2+ hour job for me. Using the 65T I'd never had problems with connectivity with the phone (Pixel 3XL) in my left pocket, and the headphones always stayed in my ears just fine even if I had to take them out for a second (with wet hands) and put them back. I've used the 75T one time while washing the car and noticed (with the same setup - phone in the left front pants pocket) some ""choppyness"" with the connection. I also had trouble getting the headphones to STAY in my ear after I had taken them out once. I had to stop everything to completely dry my hands, inner ear, and headphone before they stayed in place again. Can't imagine if I was sweating...

I use music to alter and enhance my mood, I use audio books to learn and grow as I go throughout my day, I watch movies and video clips at night to attempt to understand the world. Given this level of engagement, I don’t mind shelling out several hundred dollars to optimize such a critical component of my existence. I bought several pairs of Jabra 65t, and was pleased. I chose them because Apple’s earphones are horses***. Why on earth would I want white sticks hanging out of my ears? I researched heavily and ultimately concluded that Jabra was the clear winner. Then the 75t came along. Dear God, this device. Jabra upped the audio content and RAPED the battery life and longevity. The recharging capacity is nonexistent. This $200 little steaming pile of poop will make you wonder how the scrawny pimple-faced perpetually virginal engineers at Jabra can sleep at night. Worst $200 of my life.

BAD: The master/slave bluetooth connection the buds have make it difficult sometimes to for them to respond quickly to changes from calls to music. I found that I missed having the ability to use either bud independently (apparently thats suppose to come out soon). The right bud mysteriously stopped working after 5 days. I had read some reviews about poor jabra support, but was relieved to find them very helpful in working to resolve the matter. They spent time with me on the phone to walk me through reset procedures and then when that didnt work, they informed me they would like to send my problem to the engineers who would reach out to have my broken buds sent in, and a replacement sent out. I was impressed that this company was interested in understanding the underlying issue causing my problem so as to prevent it in the future for others.

Audio
- The audio is fantastic. I listen to mostly Drum and Bass, Uplifting trance, Psytrance and a bit of old school rock. These earbuds are able to reproduce the sound to perfection. It is very bass heavy, which I love. I've adjusted the eq to a more neutral and treble intense setting and they do a fantastic job. - I've been using the PXC550 for the past year, and I expected to use these Jabras as a set just for travelling in the bus and studying in the library. But honestly, since I've recieved this earbuds, I haven't touched my pxc550s. -Hear through is fantastic
Build
- I've watched a few reviews on this product, and thought the case was rather big. Upon receiving them, the case is unrealistically tiny and you can barely notice it in your pocket. -This is type C Charging. It makes life so much more easier, as I use a Note 9.
- The earbuds are weightless, and I haven't had any ear pains when wearing them. They're extremely comfortable. Battery life
- In the past 2 weeks, I charged them once and I've used them everyday for ~3 hours a day. Cons:
- I keep getting random notifications from the Jabra app, which sometimes is annoying. - I'll update this list, when I've used them for an extended period of time.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

And...I am shocked that they have the exact same issue! The left earbud exhibits the same crackling with no actual voice or music sound coming through. Crazy. I really wanted to like these earbuds because they are quite comfy. It seems Jabra's quality control might be lacking. Also, I contacted Jabra support via the link provided by Jabra in another review here. That was over 48 hours ago and have not heard back. Faulty products and poor customer service.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2020-03-25,"If you own an iPhone, don't get these.","I wanted to review my Jabra Elite 75t's but in full transparancy, I ordered them through Best Buy because I wanted the solid black versions. I have been using my Jabra Elite 75t's since the first day it was available to purchase. Here is a quick breakdown. Sound is great. You can pick from a list of equalizer presets or create your own custom preset. Call quality is good. I use these for my buisness calls and overall the call quality has been very good. From here, things start to fall apart if you are an iOS user. Problems:
The advertised feature that states you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch between them is false. It simply does not work and Jabra support has told me that it's due to a change made to the latest version of iOS and they have no idea if and when this will be resolved. If you are using you iPhone to listen to music and the other iPhone or iPad gets a text message or anything that has a notification. If will stop playing your music if you switch over to the other device. When you try to switch back to your iPhone to continue listening to music, it won't work. Most of the time I have to disconnect my Jabra and establish a new Bluetooth connection. There are many other examples that break when connected to two devices. It's easier to just say, it does not work. My Jabra's turn off while in my ear from time to time for no reason. Sometimes one earbud stops and the other continues. The connection the the Jabra App displays incorrect battery life sometimes. The ""Passive"" noise cancellation is simply not good but this was a given since its not real noise cancellation. If you try to use Siri, it only works on the last device you connected too which is counter intuitive. So let's say you consider your iPhone the primary device for using your Jabra and your iPad is a secondary device for things like Netflix or YouTube. If you connect your iPad second, all Siri request go to the iPad. This means you need to connect your devices in reverse order. The biggest frustration I have is that the Jabra's simply don't provide you with the functionality they advertise. The main reason I picked them is to have two devices connected at the same time and this simply does not work. I experienced issues from the start and despite many emails with Jabra support, they would not provide me a refund. If I could get a refund, I would purchase the Air Pod Pro's. So if you are an iOS user, I would stay away from the Jabra Elite 75t's. They are very frustrating to use and I think you would be disappointed considering the high cost you are paying for them. Save an extra $50 and get the Air Pod Pro's. I got the Air Pod Pro's for my teenage daughter who uses them all day long and they have been fantastic for her.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-12-29,An improvement on the already great 65t Elite Active,"First and foremost: yes, they do sound better than the 65t. Some reviews seem to indicate otherwise, but to me the difference was night and day - much more pronounced bass and cleaner highs. Maybe that's an improvement built into the app, such as a default EQ setting that alters the sound profile in a beneficial way. I don't know - all I can say is I was wowed when I played music from the 75t's. The other big improvement is actually multi-fold - the case. The new case has USB-C, which should afford faster charging. The case itself is a significantly improved shape. It's both flatter and smaller than the 65t case, so it can now sit upright where the 65t case could only lay on its back and wobble, and the case lid is magnetized so it closes and stays closed until you need it, and it's a lot easier to open than the 65t case. In addition, the earbuds themselves are magnetized so they flop into the proper orientation to charge without any work on your part. They just kind of go where they need to be. Bonus ""feature"": because the earbuds are magnetized, they will snap to each other, which might prevent one from going missing. I hope everyone who gets these makes sure to get the accompanying app. It's the key to getting the most out of the sound. It has a customizable EQ along with some presets, and you can now save your own EQ setting for later use. It also allows you to control the ""environmental"" settings such as hear-through. They may not claim to be noise-cancelling, but without hear-through on, it's very difficult to hear the outside world. I can't speak to battery life yet, having only used them for about 4 hours, but so far they're still chugging along without an issue. The case has kept them at 100% and the case doesn't seem to need a charge yet. The 65t had impressive battery life and these are supposedly better. These are a pretty significant step up from the 65t and while I don't know if I'd say previous model owners should dump their 65ts and move up, I can say that I think most people would be quite happy with the upgrade.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-10,Well worth the price!,"I needed a new headset for my work due to constant conference calls - my previous headset was collar-based and the wiring to the ear pieces broke down. Setup: The setup was a breeze and the complementing app is very easy to use. Sound Quality: The sound quality is great and you can modify the EQ through the companion app. Very good low end and crisp highs with everything in-between. Again, the EQ feature allows you to dial-in your desired sound. Build Quality: These are light-weight and fit very well in the ear. Almost like butter but without the mess. :) The buttons on the buds are responsive and don't require a lot of pressure to activate. Charging: Pretty standard for ear buds nowadays - you charge the case and place the buds in the case to recharge. It is better case than the cheaper buds I bought from Amazon but that is expected at this price point. Call Quality: Calls are clear - no dropouts. Also, my voice comes through as though I was talking directly into the phone. Considering this is the main reason I purchased these buds, I'd say they are excellent for business meetings. Features: Beyond the app integration, there are a couple neat features on the buds that make these desirable over others. The ""Pass Through"" feature allows you to (when not on a call or listening to music) use the mic to hear the room. This is very convenient when hold conversations with people in a room without needing to remove the buds, which reduces the irritation on the ear from constantly having to remove and replace the buds. Another cool feature is the ""Sidetone"" option. This allows your voice to come back through during phone calls. If you've ever used an earbud to have a conversation, you know it is a little weird because it's like talking with earplugs. By piping your voice back in, it allows you to have conversations at normal volumes without that earplug feeling. Overall, a great product and would highly recommend if you the price point isn't a bother.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Maybe wait till Jabra figures out there QA or delivers the 2nd generation? --------------------
My first pair the left earbud kept dropping the connection to the right. After a not so smooth run with tech support, I just returned to the store and got a second pair. It wasn't worth troubleshooting the issue when I was in the return window. The second pair worked great... for three months. This time, the right earbud volume plummeted. As I took the earbud out from the case, it will always say ""Connected!"". It does, but the volume is so low, the right earbud is useless but you still need it cause the left won't work without the right. After emailing with tech support for 2 days, the earbuds are being sent back for ""inspection"". Why 3-stars? 4 stars - When it works, the earbuds are great. They don't look like q-tips, feel lightweight, and the physical buttons are great. I knock off 1 star cause the case feels cheap, the auto pickup calls, switching between phone and earbuds is not as seamless as the AirPods (I own both). 1 star - These earbuds suffer from quality issues. 2/2 earbuds have some glitch that renders them unusable. Jabra tech support is 3-stars. They should RMA the unit, send you new ones on good faith (i.e. charge you if you never send the old pair back) while you send back the old ones so you're not out a $200 electronic good. Instead, I have to probably wait 1-2 weeks for the verdict. Not having a physical store like Apple does to get quick service and drop-off they need to implement something easier.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Left side just stopped working. Followed instructions to place back in case and tried putting left bud out of range and in range to connect.

That allows me to switch ears to avoid discomfort, and I only have to carry 1 set of earbuds to get me through my entire shift. My 1More Stylish set met my needs quite nicely, but I recently lost them, so I was in the market for a new set. Having heard good things about Jabra and seen a YouTube review that claimed both earbuds could be used independently compelled me to get the 75ts... I should have read the description more carefully. The sound was great as expected. They were comfortable in my ears and had a decent hold. The app and the features offered by it were also nice. The earbuds also sport a very premium look to them. These could have been my dream set of wireless earbuds, but for some reason, Jabra has decided that they will only let you use the right side earbud in independent mode which is quite useless. You mightbe thinking, ok but at least I could use the left side earbud as long as the right side one is out of the case and nearby... WRONG! If the right earbud is not in your ear, it needs to be next to the left one to maintain a connection so unless you plan to glue them together and tape them to your left ear, that's not an option. This is truly a shame, and a mind boggling decision by Jabra in this day and age. In the end, I had to send them back.

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-03-22,Fantastic but needs some work,"They sound really really REALLY good! The noise cancelling, although not active, is absolutely amazing. Personally, I prefer the noise cancelling on these over the airpod pros because with active noise cancelling, you constantly have a hissing. The passive noise cancelling is almost as good as the active noise cancelling on the airpod pros but without the hissing! The app is amazing, I've never heard a better hearthrough mode. I'm not joking when I tell you that when it's on, you feel like you don't have anything in your ears, its as good as your hearing is. Now, the reason I knocked a number. The fatal flaw that they've worked on. The connection, some people don't have a problem with the connection but I did. Cutting out, especially with the left bud in due to the motherbud design. However, they have been working on this and it has improved a lot since I first got these. It's definitely tolerable now. Also, it's said that they are going to release a firmware update that allows you to use the left earbuds by itself and ""activates"" the Bluetooth in the left earbuds the pair to the phone rather then to the right earbud. Seeing as when I have the right earbud in only and no left earbud, it cuts out less, I'm thinking that when the left earbud has an independent connection like the right earbud and will therefore have a stronger connection, they'll have way better connection and the cutting out will be almost completely gone. That's my hope and that's my opinion. All in all, very very good earbuds but they still need some work which is being done.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I haven't had any comfort issues, and the hear-through feature works great. Have done plenty of running and have had 0 issues with them staying in place. I have a couple of minor complaints:
1. These work in a master/slave configuration, meaning that the right earbud connects to your phone/whatever, and the left earbud connects to the right earbud. The issue I'm having (and have read of others having) is that when I wear my Garmin music fitness watch on my left wrist (I'm right handed), the music will cut in and out while I'm running. Everything works perfectly if the watch is on my right wrist, so I just switch wrists when I go for a run. It's not a deal breaker, but it's a little bit annoying. It would be great if Jabra could some how give you the option to decide which side was the master. 2. Too bassy. No matter how low I set the bass frequencies on the EQ, there is always a hint of muddiness/boominess to the bass. It's almost as if the EQ doesn't have any effect below 60hz or something. They mostly sound good, but try as I might, I can never get the bass response to sound right. Could just be the way they fit in my ears.

Sub bass: NoT eNoUgH bAsS
Mid bass: Completely non existent?! Mids: Like a soup that tastes alright but was served cold
Mid High: ????? Highs: Thank god they didn't take the same approach to this as the bass. The sound quality is pretty decent. With that being said, if you are used to Sennheiser mids and highs, these will definitely leave you feeling a bit dissapointed. The bass. Is. Heavy. If anything, a bit overbearing. Do not expect to be using these to have nuanced listening sessions with classical or acoustic music... Lol. The thing that really irks me the most is that you would think that with the bottom end being emphasized so much, the mids would sound more robust, instead they end up feeling quite hollow. They don't feel rich or full despite me messing with the EQ. The bass is definitely at a level where a fast paced EDM track will sound amazing during your exercise. I used the Jabra app to tune my earbuds to a upside down v shape, I feel like this matches my preferred sound signature best, definitely fiddle around with that. I cannot stress it enough, I saw many reviews stating the bass was heavy and I thought it couldn't be that bad, it's like bass was salt and a soup called for 1 tsp and the chef added the whole can. If you like mids, these will leave you feeling like there is a whole layer to the song that is missing, the bass and treble do not extend into the mids. No matter how you EQ it, you will be able to hear the lack of extension. Passive noise cancelation is decent if you get a nice seal on your ears. Speaking of seals, you will need to make an effort to get these earbuds to fall out of your ears. So, very good for vigorous activity or very sweaty people. All in all, a bit dissapointed, but that was because I was looking at these to be my earbuds for day to day. Unfortunately, I can't say they match my personal tastes enough for that to be warranted, there's just an element missing that I have grown very fond of.

Pros: -There is a very noticeable sound improvement coming from what i used to use before these which were just 20$ wired earbuds. -This thing can connect with up to multiple devices which is really cool. I can go from a youtube video on my laptop to a video on my phone but just pressing play or pause. -They fit really snug and dont feel loose at all. - Battery life is pretty long. Cons: -No instructions on how to use them that came with the actual earbuds so i had to get the app to connect and learn what single tap, double tap, etc. does on each ear. - Updating took about an hour even though the app said it would only take 15mins
- Either the app or my devices are just really buggy. But the app would never show the correct battery percentage. One time i was checking the charge on my earbuds and it would say 80% so I'd used them for only a couple minutes and it would tell me low battery and when i checked again it said 9%. Another time i plugged my case in to charge since it said it was at 60% but when i plugged it in it turns out the case was actually at 20%. - The app/device doesn't tell you its charge as its charging. (At least mine does that) I started charging it since it was at 0% and after an hour of so of charging the case was still at 0% so i unplugged the charging cable from the case and then it showed that it update? and was at 100%. - You can only use the right earbud independently. Don't know why they chose to do that but i really wish each side could be used independently. - After only a few minutes of using them my ear would already start to hurt. This is where i would switch to using the other earbud and let the other side relax but you can only use the right side independently so there goes that. - The latency is pretty bad. It takes about 2-3 seconds after pressing pause on the earbuds to actually pause songs. -Kind of a con? Maybe its just that these aren't made to work with laptops and mostly for mobile devices but using them with my laptop, I can't use the mic and listen at the same time. Because the device thinks that hear through is on since the mic is on? So i would hear myself through the earbuds from the mic. Conclusion:
I do really like these earbuds for the pros but getting them to actually work and the software for them is just really frustrating. As of now i do not recommend these especially for the price. The cons just far outweigh the pros. Maybe for 80$ or 90$ i could live with the cons but for 180$?

Jabra,Elite 75t,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2020-01-04,"Great product, until the battery stopped taking a charge","Overall pretty great product. These are designed to be more function over audio quality, so I was not expecting a fantastic music listening experience. The setup was very easy and the sound+ app works great for the most part. However, after about two weeks of using these earbuds, they stopped taking a charge. The carrying case charges, but the earbuds remain dead despite placing them in the case a numerous amount of times trying to charge them. Customer Service is taking quite a long time to get back to me to resolve the issue. In the meantime, the earbuds are not functioning at all. I did purchase these earbuds early in their life cycle, so perhaps these issues will be resolved in the future. Regardless, can't recommend a non-functioning product",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
