Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-29,Great pair of ANC headphones!,"This is my first Bose purchase, so glad I didn’t let the negative reviews keep me from trying these. I had read all the problems others were having with the app but they connected to my Galaxy Note 8 with android 9.0 instantly. From there I paired them with my Surface Pro and desktop PC both with Windows 10 and they work great with both. I had no problems switching between either PC and the phone, just had to pause playback on one and start it on another. So far the only problem I’ve found is the play, forward, and back touch controls don’t work with the pc. The volume touch controls do though, all the touch controls work connected to the phone. The sound from these surprised me a lot after some of the reviews. They sound great, they have plenty of base and are very clear with all the music I’ve played. The ANC works very well, I’m able to still hear voices a little with it on 10 though. It works best with things like motor and AC noise. They are very comfortable to me, I haven’t had any discomfort at all with these even using them with a hat on. I hope Bose can get the app worked out for the iPhone users it’d be a shame for them to miss out on a great set of ANC headphones."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-02,DO NOT BUY [UPDATE: Additional issues],"As a lot of people have said, the app is horrendous. I was able to pair these to my Iphone X the first day but ever since they have never paired. I called Bose and their suggestion was just to pair to the phone instead of the app. Great but then you cannot use a majority of the features, including pairing to two devices at once. For the price you will be paying for these, either wait for a fix or go with the Sony's. Bose rep said they hope to have a fix in August but they aren't sure. This should be their top priority and the fact that it's taking so long makes me think this is more than just an app fix. Either way, don't waste your money at this point. It's not worth the hassle and frustration if you can't pair and effectively use the headphones. UPDATE - 8.14.19 - I have managed to experience an even more significant issue with the headphones. I have the headphones paired to both my cell phone and my laptop at the same time. While the headphones do a good job of switching between the two devices when a call is received, when I receive a call on my computer (through Skype for Business), the headphones constantly disconnect from the laptop during the call and sometimes will reconnect/other times just shut off completely. Either way, this disconnects me from the call until I can reconnect the headphones. This is completely unacceptable as it has resulted in multiple dropped calls with clients. I will be returning these asap and recommend that no one buy these until these issues are fixed."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-07,Very Impressed So Far,"These are beautifully constructed headphones. I chose the silver color. Bluetooth sound quality is getting close to excellent. I had no problems setting these headphones up and running right from the box using the Bose Music App. I set mine up after their first update. I see that today 8-7-19 they have made a second update to the app. These headphones are on par with wired units. I also own a pair of Bowers and Wilkins P7 wired headphones Using a Sony DAC with it. Up until now they were my headphones with superior sound. These Bose headphone match it. I also have the Bose Soundlink II headphones. They are lighter than this unit but no noise counseling. I really like this new design. Bose put some thought into this unit with design and quality. No more of that fabric material on the headband that disenegrates over time. The ear cup material is soft and appears sturdier too. They function well. The app is not perfect but adequate at this time. I haven't had time to test the second update. They really need to add an equalizer to the app with presets and customization like the Sony units. The unit has crystal clear highs, very good midrange and decent bass. The noise cancelling is great. I think the app will get better and better. So at this point I am very pleased with them. As a note, the luxe silver is beautiful but the black will probably look better aesthetically in the long run from showing normal wear marks."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-11,Poor,"Very disappointed after reading all the hype. Static at times, difficult getting assistant to work. For all the money they charge would have expected better, much better."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-12,Connectivity,I’m a crazy audiophile and have been using headphones since the mid 1980’s. Without a doubt these are Bose’s best headphones that provide Bluetooth wireless connectivity as well as an unbelievable amount of noise reduction. The Bose 700 is what you want.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,I’m Impressed!,"The difference between my original Bose over the ear noice cancelling headphones and the new 700 is like the difference between my old PT Cruiser and my new Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit! The upgraded technology is astonishing with blue tooth capabilities, noise cancelling levels, touch on/off, volume and audio control. They are lightweight and more comfortable than the original version. I love them and look forward to many years of enjoyment."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-15,Nice but poor ergonomics,Nice design. Good sound. But poor ergonomics. If U rest the headphone around your neck the cups point upwards leaking sound everywhere. Also the on off switch is not very distinct and u never know if u have turned it off or on unlike the previous q35
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-16,overpriced but looks fantastic.,"It’s a little pricey. but looks great. no big design flaw. a little buggy app, but it has work around. Sure it’ll be fixed in the future."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-18,Great purchase. Awesome Headphone,Got it for my girlfriend and she watches videos and listen to songs while working and exercising. She loved the gift and happy with the product.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-19,"Average ( or probably below) Average quality for very high price, older version was way better","I have used the older version - QuietComfort - for over 3 years and loved it, so was very excited to buy this one, but this model is a big let down. Here are some bullet points about what I didn't like about these headphones
1. The head band is not large enough. At max, it just fits my head, if I wear a cap, it becomes a bit uncomfortable. Plus very uncomfortable on the neck when I'm resting my headphones on my shoulder when not listening
2. Noise cancelling not OK during calls, hear fairly loud hissing noise on call and multiple callers complained about hearing lot of outside noise. 3. Forces you to download app and also sign in with your email, without which it wont work
4. Didn't find any improvement in the noise cancellation ot sound quality over the old ones. I'll surelt stick to Bose but buy the old ones (QuietComfort) again rather than this, Definitely not value for cost."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-23,"AWFUL - NOT WORTH IT,","I bought these because I lost my Quietcomfort 35s and thougth this new model was going to be an improvement. I couldn't be more wrong. The setup was confusing, the app you have to download and install is not user friendy and the worst , after a couple of days of usage, the left speaker sounds like if it blasted. Returning them ASAP."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-25,5 star once the app is better,"My 10 year old Bose noise cancelling headsphones finally gave out, so I upgraded to these. In terms of sound quality and noise cancellation, they are great, 5 stars. I use on phone calls, for noise cancelling in office, and recording lecture videos for my class. Device: 5 stars. App: 2 stars. But I am being generous as I suspect Bose will address the app with all the complaints. The app is annoying, as follows:
1. You can only connect to two things- for me, I have my phone, office computer, and laptop. I wish it would know where I am to know which of the second devices to connect to, and to do so automatically. 2. Auto-turnoff: Sounds great, but will turn off in the middle of recording a lecture video. ARGH!!! So I have this feature off and somehow they still do turn off because the battery life indicates it is still good. 3. When it connects, it spells out in your ear what device it is connecting to- so annoying, I put the headphones on, I don't want 10 seconds of a woman's voice telling me what connected to. Should be able to rename things in the app, or have a system of beeps that tell you what connected to. 4. Related to 3, wish I could push a button to connect/disconnect easily. 5. Sometimes app is connected, and I am listening to music, but then it says disconnected and that it cannot find the device, so I cannot adjust the settings. 6. Sometimes the noise cancelling seems to turn off, yet app says it is at 10. Switch devices, not the setting, and it comes back on. Sometimes simple is better- my 10 year old set turned it on and off with a flick of a switch. 7. Need to have app for windows/mac so can control from computer and not need to be connected to phone. Once the app improves, 5 star for sure. Until then, beware.. though I am not sure if the more recent Bose headphones use the same app."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-29,Would not pair - UNBELIEVABLY BAD TECHNICAL SUPPORT - POS,There is no English Instructions included There are many languages but no English. I downloaded the Bose Music App. I followed the instructions. The headphones would not pair. It kept saying connection unsuccessful. I called Bose Technical Support. After waiting you get the call center in India. They wanted the serial number which require taking right earphone apart because they hid it. The person in India spent 15 minutes in broken English having give detailed personal information which they already in their system because I filled it out online. In difficult to understand English she tried to help me pair the phone. She worked with for 15 minutes then it was quitting time and she hung up on me. $400 product with no instructions in English. It paired with the phone just fine. It would not pair with the Bose Music App even with technical support from India. Technical Support was unbelievably. She would not get me manager. Bose is a terrible inept bungling company.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-09,Best headset i bought in a while ❤️,Grwat headset great experience with noise cancellation
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-09-14,Buggy app so I sent them back,"I was really excited to receive these prior to a long flight and 2 wk vacation to Hawaii. They are very high quality and futuristic looking. Initial setup was very easy after you download the Bose Music app. The ability to choose the ACN level is clutch so you dont have to take them off to have a discussion (on 10 you really can't have one with them on). Phone calls were excellent and the touch sensitive controls work very well. A couple of knocks about the build is that they dont sit as flush to the side of your head as the QC35's and they tend to slip more, requiring occasional readjustment. But those are minor and might not apply to everyone. Everything was working fine until I downloaded the app and connected to a 3rd device. After that, it wouldn't recognize/connect to the original device I paired it to (my iPhone). I tried several times to reconnect, including deleting and re-downloading the app but no luck. So despite all it's great features/looks, I ended up having to return it."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-18,Quality built and lightweight.,Quality is superb. No issues setting these 700s up for use. Noice cancelation works exceedingly well
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-19,Amazing headphones,Got them post software update. Apparently there were some bad connectivity issues before. I’ve had them weeks and no problems whatsoever. Fantastic headphones. Bluetooth Connection is great. App is awesome. Sound quality great. Look sexy as hell.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-09-19,No bass too flat a sound,The sound quality is not great due to the fact that Bose did a horrible job with zero bass. We deserve better
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-21,Worth the price,It performs better than expected
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-28,Works great!,Amazing. Works great on a plane. Cancels noise for sure!
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-10-01,HOw to return?,"Hi, the bose headphone I bought has been continuously disconnecting every few mins. I tried various options as suggested in bose customer forums, but none worked. And especially it has been disconnecting from phone frequently. I want to return it, what is the process since I don't see any 'return' button"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-03,Amazing!,Amazing!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-12,Better than my old Bose headphones,These headphones really stepped it up from the older designs. I used the wired headphones before using these and it's a big leap forward. The noise cancellation is outstanding.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-17,Can't use the headphones without an email - Fail,"I was excited to get headphones with a mic-array for phone calls in the airport, but when I received them, I couldn't use them without giving my email address to Bose. When I search online for Bose Privacy, I can see the company has a history of selling their customers as a product to data miners. And now they force you to give them your email! No way!"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-19,Great potential but needs Bose to step up and fix issues instead of pretending they don't exist.,"Before you buy this headphone know that there is no 'low' setting' similar to the QC35ii or 'wind noise reduction' setting similar to the XM3. If wind noise is a potential issue where you live you will likely not be happy with these headphones. Unfortunately Bose so far REFUSES to acknowledge the issue and instead just says to reset the headphones with a canned response. They may also tell you to change the 'self voice' setting. This also does NOTHING because the issue is not just in calls. The issue is ALWAYS there. It is incredibly annoying that Bose continues to play dumb. I've tried no less than FOUR NCH700s. They all have this problem. It is working as intended when it picks up all that wind noise. The headphones simply lack an amazing feature that their old model has. An additional benefit of this 'low' setting would be handling very bumpy bus/train rides better. As they are now you may hear some heavy thuds from the noise canceling when on bumpy rides. This is an issue for all ANC headphones I've tried, but the QC35ii 'low' setting and XM3 'wind noise reduction' settings resolve this. The only option with the NCH700 in this situation is to go into the Bose Music app and disable noise canceling altogether. Far from ideal. If they address this issue I would highly recommend these headphones. The sound is quite nice and balanced. I wouldn't call it much of an upgrade over the QC35ii, but it's very pleasant and does not have bloated bass like the XM3. The call quality is excellent at least compared to other over ear ANC headphones. Good enough that the person on the other end isn't likely to complain. The clamp can be quite strong at first, but it will loosen up. You can accelerate this process by putting the headphones around the box they come in. Essentially have the box wear the headphones the long way. The headband can creak a little bit while walking around, but it's not really noticeable when listening to music. I should note that I wear glasses. You may have less issues with this if you do not. ANC is very good. Probably on par but slightly different than the QC35ii. Not much of an upgrade if at all. XM3 still wins here quite easily. The Bose Music app works fine. I had some connection issues before the latest update, but now it seems to be consistent. Conversation mode works great. Sounds basically as good as not wearing headphones."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-10-20,May have to do an update on your 700 headphones.,"Couldn’t get the headphones to turn off, so finally contacted Bose. I had to do an update on headphones. Would have been nice if Bose had instructions regarding that possibility. Super easy update though. Seem to be working ok right now."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-20,able to connect 2 bluetooth devices at the same time unlike sony,"best functions between the old bose 35 and sony. able to connect 2 bluetooth devices at the same time which cant be done with sony, and adding touch function like sony. sound isn't as good as sony but with the functions adding, it's worth it to me. very beautiful, not too heavy and comfortable. i like it much better than 35, a real upgrade with a hefty price tag."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-28,Beautiful sound,"Compatible with every device as long as they have bluetooth, a little expensive but worth the money."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-29,Love these headphones!,"Noise cancellation is great, sound quality is outstanding, they are very comfortable, on-ear controls are pretty reliable and very easy to use. Highly recommend!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-02,when u can’t get any chill,Lifesaver. Caved after sitting on a 7am flight with the entire row behind me talking over each other the ENTIRE time. And almost getting enraged with coworkers idle inane chit chat. Can still hear some. But easier to ignore. Battery life is MUCH better than the Bose sound sport
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-05,Headphones exceeded expectations,The head phones are great for work and air travel where they cancel a significant amount of noise.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-05,Excellent,Excellent headphones. Incredible noise cancelling
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-06,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,Perfecto!
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-11-07,Do not use near water!,"So far so good on noise cancelling. However, the online comparison with other products claim that these are water resistant which is NOT was the manual says: “Do not use this apparatus near water.” So, whoever made this claim in the Amazon discussion, should correct their words."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-08,"Great mic, and great sound quality",Best headphones I've ever had. I compared them to my friend's sony headphones and these just sound better. Plus the mic sounds great on phone calls.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-10,State of the art,These babies are amazing!! I love adjustable noise cancellation and touch control. I’m now looking forward to the train commute I used to hate
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-11,Great for concentration,"I wish they weren’t so bulky, but they work perfect for a cubicle office setting. They cancel the office noise and allow me to concentrate on my work"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-11,Optimized for calls,Great noise cancellation and sound quality and really great for phone calls
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-11-13,Disappointed,Not Bose quality reproduction. Thin in sound. Lacks bass and warmth. NOT Audiophile reproduction. Way over priced
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-14,Near Perfect,"These headphones are a definite upgrade from the Bose 25QC and the Sony Wh-1000XM2. But it still isn't quite the top pair on the market. When compared to the Jabra Elite 85h and the Sony Wh-1000XM3, they fall short in a couple areas. These headphones are definitely less flashy and unassuming than the previous Bose products, great for the business world. They sport a satin finish and an extremely comfortable feel, and won't pick up dust here and there. like the Jabra's fabric exterior. Like Sony's headphones, they are easy to clean. The touch controls on these is clever and easy to use. I think I still prefer the physical buttons of the Jabra Elites, but I have no complaints about these controls. I personally think that the Quiet Comfort Bose are the most comfortable pair out there, but these are also lightweight and extremely comfortable. When you're paying for quality headphones, the thing that matters most to me is audio quality and noise cancelling ability. Audio quality is fantastic and because you can't adjust the EQs, these aren't comparable to what you would get with Sony or Jabra. In fact, I like the Jabras best because I can easily switch to a flat EQ or to EQs adjusted for speech. If you listen to podcasts and music, that's a must. Bose doesn't want you to adjust EQs and that leaves your podcasts sounding muddy on the low end. These can't be adjusted liked the Jabras with Bose's Bose Music app.
The sound quality is, in my opinion, the best I've heard. I still have complaints in that department, which is most important for $400 headphones. The noise cancelling is also, the best I've heard. These are far superior to the Jabra Elites and a leap forward from the QC, which the NC sounded a bit like a whisper. When the NC is on, I can't hear it. I just hear silence. It works and works very well. One issue that I have with the Jabras is even though they do a better job of letting you talk on the phone than most other headphones, the mic didn't pick up your voice that well. These headphones pick up your voice perfectly. I was really let down that for the price, these don't automatically pause like the Jabras when you take them off. They don't automatically turn off when you turn the ear cups. There's no speech setting for podcasts. Those simple features are really nice to have. These have phenomenal audio quality and the best noise canceling I've experienced. And most the bells and whistles that you'd expect for an expensive pair in this price range."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-17,Awesome product!,Those are amaaazing! Beautiful design and very simple to use. 🎧
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-17,The Cadillac of headphones!,"Whenever I travel (once a month) I see a lot of people wearing Bose headphones on the plane. I typically wear the Google pods for music, but they do not have noise cancellation. WHAT A DIFFERENCE THESE MAKE!! This is true noise cancellation! I can see people talking, but only hear the music I am playing. They arrived nicely packaged - like it was being presented to you, afterall, at this price point you'll most likely have them for quite some time. The Bose phone app is feature rich and has just about every option you could want. They fit comfortably although I start to feel some pressure on the top of my head after a couple of hours so I have to readjust their position. The ear padding is nice and soft too. Battery life is superb. I have charged them once (when I received them) and they have lasted all week. Now I know why so many people splurge on Bose headphones - they are truly the best at noise cancellation, sound quality and comfortability."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-17,Excelente custo-benefício!,Fenomenal!
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-17,Amazing All Around; Most Comfortable Headphones I've Ever Used; Comparison with Beats Solo Pro,"I'm going to review the headset itself and compare it to the Beats Solo Pro Wireless. In general, I'm not going to base it's quality on the comparison to the Beats Solo -- because I have a good idea of what defines quality, in a vacuum. [---The Quick and Dirty Compared to the Beats Solo Pro---]
The sound is extremely similar, with the Bass edge going to the Beats. Personally, I like the heavier Bass of the Beats, so sound wins out just a tad on the Beats. Noise canceling is better on the Bose, but both are extremely good. Comfort -- definitely, 100% Bose is better. Quality -- edge to Bose, and I like they included a case that does not need to have the headset folded, which can lead to premature malfunction due to the cord when it folds. Functions -- about the same, tie here. Overall, even those Bose is light on the Bass, I'd purchase the Bose if I had to choose. [---Comfort---]
I'm not sure why, but I see a lot of reviews saying the comfort of the Bose is not good. I have no idea if Bose changed these after those reviews, but I worn many many headphones, the these are the absolute most comfortable I have ever worn. Not too mention my ears don't get warm like the others. 5 stars for comfort on the Bose. Nothing else I can really say. [---Sound Quality---]
Overall, flat. However, that's a good thing for audiophiles, usually. Treble -- organic, not tinny, not piercing. Mids -- subdued, but present. Not muddled. Bass -- Warm and light. No real punch or deep rumble. Just a slight tremor. Personally, I like a little more Bass, but you can't go wrong with beautiful audio output -- and the Bose delivers just that. [---Noise Canceling---]
Superb. Absolutely, superb. Many levels to choose from, and the highest level just really, really does an amazing job at getting rid of those low rumbles and ""white-noises"" that floats around a given day. Amazingly well done here. [---Quality---]
These are slightly heavy, and have a metal backing on the headplate. I think these are made very well. The cushioning is great, without allowing the metal band to dig into your head. The sliding ear cups allow for a good placement. Well done here. [---Other Functions--]
Bluetooth, and music playing does not require an app, though you will be prompted to install one. BT connection has been flawless and took less than a minute with no instructions. The 'touch-tap' capability is not as robust as the Beats Solo, nor is it as intuitive or responsive, but it works. You have to tap twice to register anything, whereas the Beats you have to touch once each time. It works, but not as good as the Beats. Alexa usage works very well. Just like the actual Alexa device. Nothing much to say here -- it works, and works well. [---3.5mm AUX Cable---]
You *can*, thankfully use an AUX cable with the Bose -- and you cannot with the Beats. Although it has a very small male end (not the typical 3.5mm) on the input. But -- this is a win here for those who like perfect audio transfer. ------------------------
Closing thoughts are the Bose 700 is an amazing bluetooth pair of headphones. Amazing noise canceling capability, with flat, but organic sound. I wish it had more bass presence, but with the overall picture of these -- I'm not complaining. One of the best on the market."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-19,Awesome sound and long lasting battery,"Amazing sound as expected from Bose, but way more important, very long lasting battery. I use these about 3-4 hours a day, and they usually get me through the whole work week without needing a charge, and when they need a charge, they charge fast."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-11-19,Too expensive,Amazing design and good sound quality.
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-20,Super nice headsets - a design improvement over the QC35's,"Look for a video review I will be posting in the video shorts section above! These new headphones from Bose are .a step above the QC35's from a design standpoint. They lack the physical switch that conveniently failed on most QC35 headsets right after the warranty period ends. Bose has been terrible about fixing this widespread issue unfortunately but it looks like these new headsets will fair better with their electronic power switch. The 700's do not fold and as such have less plastic creaking noises when moving around. They fit better and are more comfortable. The ear cups are super soft and super cushiony (if that's a word) and were a pleasure to wear on a four hour flight I took the other day. Noise cancellation quality is top notch and on par with the 35's. The difference here is that you have more granularity to the amount of noise reduction. Bose says there are 11 levels but the first setting is ""off."" So in reality there are 10 steps of cancellation that can be set through the app. A button on the left ear cup will allow you to step through three favorite steps. Sound quality, however, is a little different vs. the 35's. It's not bad but it lacks the deep bass punch that the 35's have. If you're a TV/Movie watcher like I am on flights I think the 35's have an audio quality edge. These will be better for music given the sound is more neutral. But for video playback I think the 35's better replicate my home theater experience on the go. The 700's lack physical buttons for audio control (track changes, play/pause, & volume), instead going with gestures that are executed on the right earcup through a capacity sensor. I prefer this over the prior generation and it works great for the most part. I was surprised by how effective the voice assistant feature is on these - especially for iPhone users. It's possible to directly address Alexa or Google Home just by uttering the trigger word. The assistants will speak to you through the headphones. Neat feature. All in these are nice headphones but I am concerned about recommending Bose given the bad experience I had with my QC35's. They have a widespread issue with the 35's that's the result of a significant design flaw. Their only solution for out of warranty customers is to just buy a new set. If these were some cheap budget headphones fine, but this is a high-end product. Bose should be doing better by their customers."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-20,A couple of things..,"These are the first set of noise-canceling headphones I have owned, so I have no other pair to compare them with. On many levels I think they are wonderful! They are very comfortable, don't squeeze my head too tight (and I am very sensitive to that) and they are very well padded for extended use, I normally use them for an hour or so a time. I didn't love that I had to install the app to use on my phone, but my experience with that was pretty painless and most everything set up without an issue, and I have not had a lot of disconnects. What I have had a problem with was setting up Alexa, I cannot get that to work for anything! Bluetooth finds the headphones with no problems but when it tries to connect through the Alexa app it fails every time. Works flawlessly with google assist, however, so I'm not sure what the problem is there but it's disappointing. When I started using the headphones the blue tooth was experiencing a lot of stuttering, super annoying, but thankfully a firmware update seemed to fix that issue. I hooked these up through BlueTooth with both my android phone and my PC with Windows 10 with no problems, the sound quality is AMAZING, the noise cancellation is awesome! And this has quickly moved from a luxury item to a necessity. Love them! Are they the best on the market? Not sure, but apart from the couple of issues I have had, they are fantastic!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-21,Great sound,These are sleek gorgeous and so comfortable. I can wear when I work out or just around the house. Can’t wait for my next flight to wear to keep the noise out. The sound is crisp I have no complaints
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-21,Superb noise-canceling headphones,"I've been using Bose QC 35 II headphones for a year now and very happy with it. When I had the opportunity to review the Bose 700 headphones, I was very excited and had to give it a try. Naturally, this review is more of a comparison between the 700 and the QC 35 II for those are shopping between the 2 choices. Bose 700 replaces QC 35 II as the flagship noise-canceling headphones. After trying it out for a few days straight, I have to say I'm not disappointed. Both have their pros and cons but in the grand scheme of things, the 700 edges out. Design and FIt. The 700 has a more modern, stylish look. There are hardly any buttons on it since it relies on touch control. The head band has a full-length padding underneath while the QC3 5 II has the padding at the center part of the head band. The 700 fits well and is very comfortable. However, I like the loose fitting of the QC 35 II on my head a little better. Both are really comfortable and I can wear them for hours on end. Controls. The 700 uses a touchpad on the earcup to control most functions while QC35 II uses physical buttons. Understandably, the touchpad control is more trending than button mashing. It's mostly spot-on for me. No major issues there. Phone App. The 700 uses the new Bose Music app while the QC 35 II uses the Bose Connect app. Since Bose took away most buttons on the 700, you'll need the Bose Music app in order to manage the control. On the QC 35 II, you'll just need the Connect app to do the initial setup (Bluetooth pairing, assigning the action button to ANC level switching or voice assistant) and delete it later if you want. Active Noise Canceling. The ANC on the 700 is every bit as good as that on the QC 35 II, if not better. The 700 has like 11 levels while QC 35 II has only 3 (high, low, off). The ANC completely eliminates the HVAC noise in my office. You can still get a hint of people talking in the background (depending on the ANC level). On the QC 35 II, you can toggle between the 3 ANC levels with the action button on the left earcup (which can be customizable with the app). On the 700, you'll have to use the Bose Music app.
Sound quality. I'll give the 700 an edge on this front. It has more balance in the mids and more extension in the highs. Lows are about the same. Good, clean bass. Not the bass head heavy kind. The 700 seems to have a slightly wider soundstage as well. Overall, it's nowhere close to audiophile level but it is not designed to be. Call clarity. Good clarity on the other end of the line for phone calls. No people complains about having hearing issues when talking to me on the phone yet. Connectivity. Both 700 and QC 35 II can pair with multiple Bluetooth devices and can connect up to two devices at the same time. The latter is a big selling point for me. What it does is that it allows me to connect wirelessly to my phone and laptop simultaneously. Say, when I was watching a youtube video on the laptop and a phone call comes in, the headphone will automatically switch to the phone connection to take the call. If you want to switch between the two connections, simply stop the playback on on device and start playing on the other. Both comes with a 3.5mm audio cable for when you're running out of battery, or plugging to the entertainment system on a flight. Battery life. Both offer 20 hours of ANC on a single charge. What the 700 really brings to the table is the fast charge which gives you 3.5 hours of battery life for a 15-minute charge, as well as the updated USB-C charging port. Portability. The QC 35 II is foldable while the 700 is not. As a result, the included travel case for the 700 is a little bigger. Not a huge difference in size per se but QC 35 II is more portable. In summary, for the 700 headphones:
pros:
+ Bluetooth connectivity up to 2 devices at the same time
+ superb Active Noise Canceling
+ nice and comfortable fit
+ touchpad control
+ good sound quality & call clarity
+ 20 hours of ANC on a single charge
+ fast charging gets 3.5 hours of battery life for a 15-minute charge
+ USB-C charging
+ 3.5"" wired connectivity
cons:
- needs phone app to control some functionality
- non-foldable design
- more expensive than top competing models
As with all headphones which are subjective, I would recommend going to a store to try it out and decide for yourself. That being said, I doubt you would be disappointed with the 700. It is a well-rounded pair of noise-canceling headphones with good sound quality."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-11-21,Great noise cancelling headphones but not great headphones,"Bose has been the premium noise cancelling headphone leader for decades but in recent years competitors have caught up or even exceeded Bose in some ways. These Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones are Bose's latest attempt to regain supremacy. In some ways they succeed and in others they don’t. Truly outstanding and unmatched:
• An excellent microphone array that makes for class leading voice call quality (particularly in noisy environments) and very good noise cancellation
• Excellent Dual Bluetooth connectivity with 8 device memory and easy switching (although a few others offer dual connections)
Top Tier and among the best:
• Excellent noise cancellation on par with the best competitors for air travel, but some competitors are better under some other circumstances
• Excellent user interface with touch and buttons giving access to most functionality without app
• Excellent voice prompting and variety digital assistants supported
• Excellent build quality
• Excellent comfort
• Excellent travel case
Competitive but not class leading:
• Bluetooth 5 with AAC Codec (some competitors offer higher quality codecs)
• 20 hours of battery life - but only at modest volume
• USB-C, but only used for charging, not audio
• Wired audio facility but with less common 2.5mm jack
• Fast charging, but almost half the rate of the best
• Software updates via mobile applications
• Travel form factor folds flat but doesn't fold up so thin but not as small as some
Noncompetitive or undesirable:
• Mobile device apps for iOS and Android are not well designed or implemented - feature poor, buggy, create privacy concerns, and are required for some functionality
• While audio is crisp and clear, and decent for voice and background music listening, actual fidelity is poor and sound stage is flat with unimpressive volume, underwhelming bass that decreases as volume increases, no punch or emotion, and annoying shrill piercing treble. Conclusions:
If your primary use is for voice calls in noisy environments, these are unsurpassed - buy them. And a number of other features are competitive so these could be good choice as long as music quality is not important to you. But I think that the major competitors that include Bowers & Wilkins PX7's, Sennheiser PXC-550II's, Sony 1000MX3's, or even Bose QC35II's are better choices for most people - they are more versatile, meet or beat the Bose 700's in most respects, and all have a significantly better music fidelity."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-21,Disappointed.,"When playing music the sound quality is great. My problem is when using the phone function the noise cancellation does not work. It amplifies Ambient sound. When I set my my phone to do not disturb calls still come through. I do not expect to have these problems with such an expensive set of headphones. I had purchased the Bose qc35 II and the exact same problem. So I returned the headphones to Amazon and purchased the 700. If this is something that can be addressed I would appreciate Bose reaching out to me. Technical support is poor, and they do not understand the problem."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-21,"Great Sound Quality, Lightweight, Easy to Operate","I've been using these headphones for a week and I can't get over the superior sound quality. They feature terrific high end frequency replication and offer a bass you can feel. I experimented briefly with the Bose music app, but I have enough apps on my phone already and this connects fine as a regular Bluetooth device. In the end, the comfort and sound quality are the most important and not the other features. Both are great on this product. These headphones have a really nice, sleek design. The ear cups swivel and can be easily adjusted to fit your head. The ear cups have what seems to be a soft leather or imitation leather padding that is comfortable and helps create a seal that blocks out external noise. You can adjust the amount of noise cancellation, so these are ideal headphones for both travel and zoning out. The headphones charge with a USB-C charging port. At this time most of my other devices require a USB Micro-B, but I'm seeing more of he C ports and cables. A charging cable is included along with an AUX cable. You also get a very nice plastic hard case that zips closed. The headphones have a minimal design with only three buttons. The only button that's labeled is the Bluetooth button. One really cool feature is that the front half of the right ear cup can recognize taps and gestures. Instead of feeling around for a tiny button, you can just double tap the ear cup to play your music or answer a call. You can adjust volume by swiping down or swiping up. The 20 hour battery life means these are always ready to play. I'm sure this set of headphones has more features than I'll ever use. The most important thing is that they are very comfortable, easily adjustable, and sound terrific. If you love music on the go, these headphones are a perfect choice."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-22,"These are pretty great, with a few problems...","Using these wirelessly, with noise cancellation requires an app, and an account. This isn’t a big deal for me because I already have a couple wireless Bose speakers, but others might be bothered. The app is fairly useful, but it’s a pain to pair these to different devices (my phone and iPad, for example) when the “other” device was used last and is in range. I imagine that I’ll eventually figure out what I’m doing wrong and quit doing it. For now, it’s the most difficult to pair Bluetooth device that I have. ...but it’s worth it. These are pretty light. As light and comfortable as my old wired Quiet Comfort headphones, and lighter and warmer sounding with almost as much detail as my Sonys. The noise cancellation is perfect, and adjustable in the app. I keep the ANC turned up to 10, but my wife, who gets this weird discomfort from some ANC headphones feels that 7 is a comfortable # while providing good noise reduction. These are good passive noise reducers too due to the ear cup design and padding material. Speaking of design, these are cutting edge cans. The adjustment mechanism is pretty out there, but is smooth as silk and hopefully durable as well. A minor niggle related to design is the unlabeled buttons. You can’t see them when you are wearing these anyway, so I get it, but labels would be helpful just as a reminder. These fold flat, and come with a little case that has a magnetic trapdoor for the USB A to C charging and wired listening cord. There’s no room for a wall wart in there so you’ll have to keep that someplace else. In case you are wondering, a Lightening to USB C cord will not stand in as an audio signal cord. Almost forgot: The gesture based volume, pause, skip forward/backward controls work perfectly."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-24,Very Nice!,"I love these headphones. I have been jealous of my wife's Bose headphones for a while. So I jumped at the chance to get these. First things first... you need to download the app. I mean, you don't need to, but the app is fantastic so you'd be silly not to. And these 700s are cool because in the app you can turn up or down the noise cancellation. I don't even know how it works but you can make it so it's soundproof which works fantastic or your can turn that feature to 0 and you can hear right through the headphones while they are still on. Pretty incredible! The sound quality is amazing. It's like being in a theater or something. It's full range bass and treble. The complexity of sound delivered is hard to describe but these headphones feel like something that belong in a music studio. And back to the Bass... I love to jam out to some bassy rap every once in a while. Right now I'm on a Lizzo kick. And these headphones make me feel like I'm in a concert. I can't say enough good things about them. Also, I think this design is super sleek and works just fine for me, as a guy, but would work perfect for my wife too."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-11-25,noise cancellation does not live up to advertisement.,"The online documentation is not always accurate and the documentation that comes with earphones is almost nonexistence. The TV ads, etc. are misleading since they imply that with the noise cancellation on max, one will hear little of the surrounding environment which is not true."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-25,"It's fine, but glitches from time to time.","Overall these are fairly satisfying headphones. The button placement is okay, not great. The fit is extremely comfortable. I have a decent size head and I really enjoy feel of having them on it. Battery: I have had a couple occasions where in the headphones seems to turn themselves on and run out of battery. That was very inconvenient to say the least. Otherwise the battery life has been excellent at 15 hours. Tech: The noise cancellation is adequate, on par with my qc20s that I've had for five years. If it's better I'd say only very slightly. I've also had a few occasions where the headphones would produce lots of static or refused entirely. If I weren't so busy I would've sent them in for warranty repair. What about them again if they didn't have any glitches? Probably."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-26,BEST EARPHONES ON THE MARKET,"First let me say how much my daughter talks, and we are loud people. With these ear phones on, at a normal level, I couldn't hear her over the music that was playing. These are quiet possibly, the most comfortable earphone that i have ever worn or tried on. They have a pillow on top of the arch as well. They were easy to adjust and seem very sturdy. The look is beautiful. I would recommend these over the other top name ear phones. Now that I have both and can compare... I am a BOSE fan for sure!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-29,Amazing Quality and Sound,"I feel spoiled each time I put these headphones on. The noise cancelling feature is nice, especially when I'm trying to work from home. With our kids in orbit, it can help me focus. It was a straightforward process to pair these headphones with my iPhone once I had the Bose Music app downloaded. My only wish is that I could pair these with my MacBook. However, if you have multiple devices (iPhones, iPad, etc.), you can pair these headphones with up to eight devices."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-01,Great everything love them,Wow wow wow. Bose is where it's at. Besides the great noise cancelling great sound great battery life these are super comfortable. I'm selling my old head phones lol you really can't ask for anything more except maybe a little easier on price but hey its Bose your paying for the best !!! !
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-02,Great all around noise canceling headphones with a modern look,"I’m really impressed by this next generation of Bose headphones. They no longer look like something you would expect to see on a traveling businessman who spends half their time on flights. As a headphone-ophile, I’ve tried to break down what I really like about these with a couple of places where the design may have let them down. Positives:
- Noise-canceling is great, as you would expect from one of the best in the industry
- 4 microphones make this usable for phone or video call conversations from your computer, without the need for an external mic. Voice quality was very good, easily as much as my airpods. - The earcups are very comfortable, even with eyeglasses on. This is HUGE and a place other headphones often cause me problems. - Battery power consumption was minimal and accurate to what the vocal readings said. I also liked that the remaining battery was given in terms of time remaining rather than the percentage of power. The voice is nice. - Turning the earpiece doesn’t control the power, instead, you click on a button. This is really nice for not accidentally turning them off. They auto shut off after 5 minutes of not being used. - Pairing was dead simple. - In talk mode, the noise-canceling automatically turns down to a low level so you can hear yourself talk! So so:
- I couldn’t really tell a difference in the noise-canceling levels between 5 and 8 or so. - The ear cups don’t necessarily cover the ear well enough that a lot of movement of your head keeps the seal. I found the cups to be a little narrow. They were really comfortable, but any quick side to side movement sometimes caused them to shift on my head enough to break the seal against my head and negate the value of the noise canceling."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-12-04,Excellent noise cancellation but a couple negatives,"BUILD QUALITY AND DESIGN
-Overall very good build quality. The headband is sturdy. The leather-like material on the earcups and headband is supple and thick and probably the best I've felt. -The exterior earcups have a nice silver color but are made of all plastic so a slight downgrade there. -The silver color is attractive with its shiny metallic look. -The custom case is the best I've seen. It is very slim and form fitting. There is a clever, magnetic flip down pocket with enough room to store a charging cable and headphone wire. COMFORT
-Comfort is excellent. The over-ear design cups the ears nicely and does not press on my ear cartilage at all. SOUND Quality
-Good vocal clarity for music, podcasts, and calls. -Not much bass but I don't expect much from headphones. -There is some baseline static at all times (even when disconnected from your phone) which can be drowned out when something is playing. You will not get dead silence when nothing is playing though. BUTTONS
-Only 3 hard buttons which are noise cancellation, voice assistant (google, alexa), and power. -The power button will change states with a short press of the button which is nice compared to other headphones that require you to long press. -Other functions are via the touch sensitivity - play/pause, volume, forward/back. I prefer hard buttons which are more reliable, less prone to accidental presses, and are not affected by gloves or cold hands. -None of the hard buttons nor the touch sensitive area are labeled (not even on/off) which makes it unintuitive to just pick up the headphones and use them. APP
-The app is not necessary to use the headphones including the noise cancellation feature. You can connect via bluetooth directly to your phone. -The app does allow you to customize noise cancellation settings (0-10) which may not be necessary for you. The default settings for the noise cancellation button are 0,5,10 which will be fine for most users. NOISE CANCELLATION
-Level 10 (max) works very well. Don't expect it to 100% block out noise as that's not realistic or even desired. Expect it to block about 80-90% which is very good. Quick, abrupt noises such as keyboard typing will sneak through. People talking is blocked pretty well. -There is a fair amount of baseline static hiss at level 10 which is presumably part of the noise cancellation feature. This hiss does not go away when there is nothing playing or even when disconnected from the phone. -Level 5 doesn't do much noise cancellation and introduces even more baseline static. -Level 0 (off) creates high volume static hiss which is unusable for me. OVERALL
If you want excellent noise cancellation, go ahead and get these headphones as they work very well. The attractive silver theme and excellent custom case are other highlights. However, there are some flaws. The touch controls work fine but I would prefer more hard buttons (and label them please). The baseline static hum was annoying to me but won't be an issue if you constantly have something playing."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-06,Awesome product,I love these head phones! They will not disappoint you
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-08,Best headset,Worth the money
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-08,Good,Great
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-08,Great features!,"I love the noise cancellation! I also love that they connect to two devices at the same time! No more toggling Bluetooth between my phone and tablet. Just start using the device of choice and they WORK! This was the most I spent on a set of headphones, but I would do it again."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-13,Great Purchase,"I bought these for travel, they are a game changer. Must have for any red eye flight!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-14,Love these!,"I have had these for less than a day, but so far I love them. They are way more comfortable than my Beats. The case is much slimmer and easier to fit in my backpack. I also think the music sounds better. The noise cancelling appears to be as good as my Beats but I will wait until my next flight to judge fully."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-15,"Filters Out Ambient Noise Flawlessly, Still Cannot Charge and Listen to Music at the Same Time","The Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700 are a comfortable set of headphones that filters out ambient noise extremely effectively. The headphones are large, but comfortable to wear, and many of the controls are on the headset themselves to allow for easy hands free operation. I found the unit filtered out ambient noise fantastically - when wearing them in the house, the headphones filtered out the sound of the kitchen exhaust fans, sound of traffic outside, bathroom fans, and even softened the ambient chatter from my kids. I am able to hear my music clearly, answer phone calls with people being able to hear me as clearly as I could hear them, and most controls can be done from the headset so I don’t have to pull my phone out. Seriously - the sound in this headphone is amazing, and it truly filters out those annoying ambient noises for both you and a caller if they’re on the line with you. This is one of those pricey items I never thought I needed until I actually got it! The unit comes with a type-C to USB charger cable, a cable to plug into a 1/4” headphone, and a case to carry all the wires and headphones in. The headset lays flat when stored and the case can be easily tossed into a backpack to take on the go. The headset does not require you to download an app to use the headphones, but if you’re looking to fine tune the headset, getting the app would be the best. By downloading the app, you’ll be able to adjust the noise cancellation between 1-10 as opposed to the set favorite 0, 5, and 10, and you can change the favorites to a level you prefer more. The app also allows you to save settings, set up Alexa/Siri/Google Assistant, as well as set up other prompts such as the voice prompts that tell you how much battery life you have left. I found downloading and syncing the app to my headset and iPad was an easy process and it didn’t mess with my iPad in any way. The bluetooth connection for the Bose Headset is good and I am able to go from room to room with my iPad in one location without losing connection. I live in a single level home, and I haven’t lost connection even though I’m completely across the house. This will vary from home to home, so you’ll have to test out the connection and how far you go in your own home. If you’re not syncing the headset to your phone/tablet, you can use the headphone to device wire that came with the headset so you have a wired connection instead. This is helpful when using devices that aren’t your own such as the airline media players or when using a friend’s iPod when out. The battery life of the unit is pretty amazing with 20 hours at hand. I’ve been using the headset on and off throughout the month and the battery life seems true to time. Each time I turn on the unit, the headset announces how much time I have left so I remember to charge my headset. One of the biggest gripes that I have with this Bose Headset is problem that spans across all Bose Headsets - you still cannot charge your headset and listen to music at the same time. If your headset is on low, you really will need to charge it while you’re not using the headset as the unit will not charge and will immediately turn off once you plug the charging cable in. This is something that I’ve noticed happens on all Bose headsets and it’s incredibly annoying. That said, the headset does have a good battery life, so hopefully you’ll remember to charge it while you’re not using it. Also, if your battery runs out, you can still use these headphones as passive wired headphones using the included wire. Overall, this is a great headset to consider if you’re looking for a truly noise cancelling headset. I can’t say how it would compare to other branded headsets, but I can say it’s a nice upgrade to the much older Bose Wireless Headsets, and an absolute delight to own if you’ve never used a really good noise cancelling headphone set before. It’s a pricey splurge that’s worth every penny if you’re looking to filter out ambient noise while listening to your music."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-16,"Beautiful, comfortable and decent sound quality","These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I got rid of a couple pairs of Beats and a pair of high-end Sony headphones because they weren't comfortable to wear for more than a half hour. They either got too hot or pressed on my ears. These Bose headphones I can wear for hours and almost forget I have them on my head. The design is unique and a beautiful fit and finish. The sound quality is standard Bose - nice mids and highs while the bass lacks a little and sounds over digitized. The sound cancelling is not near the same level as the Sony headphones that carry a similar price. If you #1 concern with headphones is noise cancelling I would suggest trying on the Sony's to see if they are comfortable for long period of use. If they are then maybe go with the Sony's if you listen to more bass-heavy genres. If you'd rather have a blend of sound quality, noise cancelling, design, prestigious brand and comfort then get these Bose headphones and don't give it a second thought. The Bose app required for these headphones works perfectly fine. I was concerned after reading the mixed reviews but I have had zero issues in the past couple months of usage."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-18,Pricey but a great listening experience,"I was looking for a good set of high-end Bluetooth headphones that felt comfortable, sounded good, and were simple to use. The Bose 700s checked all those boxes. I'd had the B&O H9 gen 3 headphones and found them fiddly and overpriced. On the other hand, the Bose cans work like a charm. The app is okay, it's not deep or anything, but I was looking for a reasonably straightforward setup anyway. If you want a ton of specialized features these may or may not be product for you, but for over-ear wireless headphones I found they did everything I needed and more--and look good doing it."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-12-19,Excellent...with some quirks.,"The short version: If you're ok with the occasional software glitch and single-device Bluetooth connection, these things are gold in every other respect. For the price, though, you may not deem it worth such concessions. Top notch comfort, typical impressive Bose sound, spectacular voice features, and a beautiful design outweigh the quirks for me. The long version: So many thoughts on these. Overall, I love them and use them basically all day every day at work. Let's start with the bad:
1) Software glitches
This seems to be a staple of modern Bose products, which is disappointing to say the least. The good news is they have a pretty good track record for fixing things...it just takes a *long* time. In the case of the NC700, this is currently a crackling sound when the headphones are connected to multiple devices at once. This is a great feature in concept, and the instant-switching of audio depending on where it's coming from is great, but it just doesn't work. Whenever my phone and PC (or any other combination of devices) are connected at the same time, you get a ton of audio crackle that makes listening to anything terrible. So you have to make your choice. Not a big deal, but when you're pricing your headphones at $400 you're talking a different league, and things like this are much less acceptable than in the $100 range. 2) More software glitches
Another issue I have is related to the ability to press a button on the left cup which pauses whatever you're listening to and reduces the noise cancelation to 0 (which actually passes through audio vs just turning off noise cancelation). This is an amazing feature I use constantly throughout the day in the office. However, sometimes when I use this it'll pause, ramp down the noise cancelation, and then a second or so later of not touching the headphones it'll ramp the noise cancelation back up and not resume what was playing. This is super annoying since people wait for me to turn this feature on, only for me to hear their voice fade out shortly after. Once this starts happening it happens every time until I turn them off for a bit. 3) MORE software glitches
Google Assistant integration is...fine. Most of the time, due to #1 presumably, when I press it it'll say I need to open the Google Assistant app on my phone first. Which is dumb! It should just work. I've had various issues with it. 3) Lack of bass / EQ
Bose doesn't like you messing with their sound, which is why no EQ is currently available. Although they have stated they're working on this feature. Who knows when - or if - it'll actually roll out. Regardless, out of the box these things definitely don't punch like other Bose devices. It honestly feels like my SoundSport Wireless headphones pack more punch than these. They still sound fantastic, but you can tell they're capable of really punching and I'd like to bring that out more in my music. You'll see those 3 points repeated a lot among other reviews and on the Bose community forums. Now, to the good (in no particular order)! 1) Sound quality
Top notch. Not much to say here. If you like other Bose products, you'll like these. The bass could be punchier, but when it hits it hits so nicely. 2) Comfort
These are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I wear them for 6+ hours a day and love them. Bose has comfort figured out with all of their headphones. 3) Phone Calls & Voice Quality
Bose put a lot of effort into making these headphones work great with phone calls. Audio is crystal clear, and the crazy array of microphones allow you to practically whisper even in noisy environments while still picking you up without a hitch. I love making phone calls with these and will tell people to ""hold on"" while I connect my phone to them if I'm not wearing them when someone calls. 4) Touch Controls
The play / pause / next / previous gestures work great every time, even in cold weather. I know people have had issues with the Sony equivalents of these, but it's not a problem. They all work well and are intuitive and fast. 5) Design
These things are stylish. I love the new, industrial, minimal design. They feel great while still being super lightweight. Overall, you won't regret purchasing these. The real question is, are these worth the extra cost from Sony's equivalent? I made my choice and am very happy with the Bose NC700 despite the software issues I hope to be resolved...eventually."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-21,THEY SILENCE THE RAGE AROUND ME.,Awesome headset!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-22,Solid wireless headphones,"There are small issues with the software and integration with apps. Nothing terrible, but for this price I would love for the user experience to be spotless. For example when I charge them and turn them on, the voice message will still say there headphones needs to be charged. Still, I'm a huge fan of nose and really love this product."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-23,Not quality nor worth the money. Look elsewhere.,I’ve had the B&O Bluetooth headphones since 2015. Bought these and am disappointed. If only I could get a refund...if definitely take that option and buy a new pair of B&O. Not the quality you’d expect from Bose or for the money. I’d encourage you look elsewhere.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-25,Expensive but good,Bose make the best headphones
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-25,"Yo, get them","These are perfect headphones, the case needs to be a charging case bc why not. I'm paying 400 and would pay 450 for the case to be self charging/a charging dock. Sucks you can't change the EQ through the app. I don't even use the app bc it doesn't connect automatically and please add a simple on/off button and do not get rid of the headphone jack. I thought it would be useless and just used that mug on a 8 hr flight instead of airline head phones. Kinda made me happy bc my fiance praises airpods and I loved saying why don't you plug you airpods in; rip, you can't. Bass is alright but I'd prefer to boost it. Can't think of anything else I don't like, the touch controls are literally worth the $400 cost. They make it so easy to change the music."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-26,Base was good,I like ways of looks but noise cancellation is not good
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-26,They are BOSE what can I say....,I bought them as a gift for my husband. Like many he is addicted to the noise cancellation on Bose and he has had several different styles of their headphones. So far he loves them and is very happy with the gift. There were no issues setting them up and noise cancellation is as great as ever.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-26,Good if you don’t use headphones alot,I don’t like that you can use only for a bit then the part that goes around your ears starts making you sweat
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-26,Great,Very good
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-26,Not as good as qc2 for calls,Older version makes far better calls else this is better for just music and noise cancelling
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-28,Excelente,Todo
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-31,Nice headphones,"I was kind of surprised that there is only three levels of noise cancelling (10, 5, and 1). I thought I read there were 7 levels and you could adjust some wavelength that you might find annoying. The ear cups are comfortable, but after an hour flight, I started noticing my ears were touching the outer cup. Not painful, but again, surprised. Sound quality is great and the battery life is awesome"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-31,Great product,Thumbs up
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-31,I can choose what ambient sounds to hear when wearing around others or traffic.,"Music, phone calls, noise control.......etc."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-02,Most comfortable headphones I have ever owned.,"First off the sound quality of these headphones are amazing, wouldn't suspect any less from Bose. The leather on the ear cups are super soft and very comfortable. As far as noise cancelling goes, it's decent, but not the best. I have had others that have active noise canceling but they are more passive in nature. The battery lasts for upwards of 20 hours, perfect for traveling wherever you go. These in my opinion are probably the best on ear wireless headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,Better then the last version,Nice and clean lines. Big upgrade.
Bose,NC700,4,0,2020-01-03,Compare with Sony,"I was using a different product when I received these for review, so here's my comparison to the Sony WH-XB900N Wireless Noise Canceling Extra Bass Headphones. - Sound was good in both...bass was good, and isolation was good. - Bose had better white-noise...easily twice as good. Sony was good, not bad, but Bose was outstanding
- Sony's side button that immediately cancels white-noise is fantastic...Bose requires you to push a button, which can take a few seconds, and then you have to reset your level (Bose has 0-5-10) as opposed to just taking your finger off the side (Sony)
- Sony folds, Bose doesn't
- When you turn the headphone part to hang on your neck, the Sony turns with the soft earpieces against you...Bose turns the hard outside. I definitely prefer the Sony on this one...the Bose sometimes irritated my collarbone...I think this is a design flaw, but maybe Bose thinks some people prefer it this way. - Battery life was the same
- Bose wins for comfort...they are lighter on your head, and I noticed I sweat more with the Sony's because of their seal and weight. - Bose wins for the right-ear touch controls...I have found about 50% success with the, sometimes having to push twice or picking the wrong one. Bose works great, although I often miss and hit/swipe the wrong control (user error)
Overall, since I received both free for review, I'm going Bose. If I was paying, I think I'd save the over 100 bucks and go Sony. Good luck!"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-03,Great,Like noise cancellation but they slip at times
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-04,Upgrade,"My boyfriend loved and practically wore out the previous model of Bose headphones, so I got him these latest as a Christmas gift. He wears them for hours listening to podcasts while commuting or working. The padding is super soft (hope it doesn't wear out sooner than the last pair!) and comfy - sound is excellent. Not sure about Alexa yet, but the design and sound are excellent."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-04,Bose is back in the game,"I used the QC35s until Sony released the WH-1000XM3. I found both of these models to be comparable for ANC but the Sony's had far superior sound quality compared to the QC35s. So for all my flights, the Sony's came with me while the QC35s stayed home. With this new release from Bose, these are now my go-to headphones for both travel and online meetings. I found the sound quality between the Bose 700 and the Sony to be pretty comparable but when flying, the ANC on these was far and away the best performer. By turning up the ANC, I barely heard the plane's engines (something I have never achieved with any other ANC headphones I have tested). I have also tested these with online meetings and the clarity was excellent. The headband is comfortable to wear and these do look REALLY sleek. These do not fold up like both the QC35s and the XM3s did so if you value a small footprint, these do take up more space. For me, I take an oversize bag as carry-on and just throw the headphone case inside so this is not an issue for me. These headphones charge with a USB-C cable (as do the XM3s). The expected battery life on these is 20 hours which is 10 hours less than the Sony's. Since most of my flights are domestic or to Europe, this is long enough for me to get to my destination but is something to consider if you value the longer battery life.. The 700s can be synced with more than one device so I was able to switch between my iPad and my phone easily (not a capability of the XM3s). Overall, the better ANC capabilities and comparable sound quality to the XM3s make these my go-to travel headphones although both are excellent headphones. If you are between the 2 models, think about what you will require for battery life, how much noise cancelling do you require (busy office vs jet engine), and do you need the multiply syncing option."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,Game changer,Noise canceling is the best part when on a noisy air plane!
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-05,False advertising on AR sound.,"False advertising, they show off about AR sound, which is not a feature of the product. The feature that the product offers is VR sound, which is very different from AR sound."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-05,Underwhelming..,"I bought this primarily for work phone calls, because they hype the 7 microphones and noise cancellation, but I get consistent complaints that no one can hear me.. frustrating that a product of this cost does not perform as promised..."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-06,Not at all worth the price,"So for starters, this was the first set of wireless or noise cancelling headphones I've purchased. Right off the bat I'm a bit annoyed because it REQUIRES the Bose Music app to connect. So I download the app, set up an account and all that jazz. Not really that big of a deal, but annoying when every other set of headphones you've ever used you could just plug in and start listening. So now I've got them connected and the noise cancelling is actually pretty decent. Not perfect, but even without anything playing through them they reduced the outside noise of fans, tvs, etc by 80-90%. With music playing through the headphones it's near impossible to hear anything else. The sound quality good but. It is very clear and well balanced at unreasonably high volume (for reference at the level where my Samsung Note 9 warns me) but at more reasonable volumes (around 40%) it feels hollow, almost like you would expect it to sound if the driver was mounted to a tin can held over your ear. Still better than nearly any other over the ear headphones and these are, by far, the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I was able to wear these for about 6 hours over the course of the day without even a hint of discomfort. The battery only discharged about 30% all day. Personally, these would be a steal for $200 and a good value for $250, but at nearly $400, these are the Rolls Royce of headphones when I think I'm more of a Lamborghini guy."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-07,"Sounds excellent, love the noise cancellation, will be great for travel","This is the first pair of high end bluetooth headphones that I have owned (though I have similar quality headsets for TV), and so far I am very impressed by the sound cancellation quality and the crisp, Bose quality sound. I've always enjoyed the quality of Bose speakers, and these do such a good job of muting the outside world that you can comfortably listen at a very low (and safe) volume for your ears. I did not download the Bose Music App, as I've had difficulty with the App Store, but I'm still able to use the headset with noise cancellation levels 0, 5, & 10, and bluetooth or audio cable connection to my iPhone or laptop. The battery life is considerable, at almost 20 hours, and they are quite comfortable to wear. I've mostly worn them in a stationary position while watching movies or listening to audio books, with minimal movement. I don't think that they hold in place well enough to sustain much head movement, but this isn't really a set for exercise, unless maybe you're on a stationary bike or similar. The volume can be adjusted within basic limits by sliding your finger up or down on the outer metal surface of the right ear piece, to the forward side of the metal swivel bar. I prefer not to clutter my phone with too many apps, but may eventually give the App a try to see how it expands the features on the use of the headset, including the customized audio settings. So far I'm very pleased with the quality, and the carrying case is streamlined and very nicely made."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-07,The old ones are better,"HATE the interface
Bought these fir my sun who has autism- too easy for him to turn off or up or down accidentally"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-08,Best over the ear head phones I have ever purchased,If you know anything about BOSE you know the sound quality is one of the best if not the best. These are great for watching movies on your tablet of for airplanes or even working out. They are light and easy to use. The Bluetooth is fast in pairing and the battery life is amazing. You can customize them with the app also. The app helps tremendously when trying to preserve battery life and sound profiles. The only thing that you may not like is that they do not fold up like some other headphones. If you want great sound and a great design then these are for you.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-09,Major letdown,Incredibly disappointing product. It skips continuously. I had the QC35 previously and was excited about the upgrade. Not worth the extra money and the headaches.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-10,Best headphones I’ve ever seen/heard,"These are absolutely incredible. They can handle 2 Bluetooth sources at once and effortlessly switch to whichever is playing sound. You do have to pause one to switch to the other. Great sleek design, look futuristic af. Easy controls, touch controls are great. Noise cancelling is phenomenal. I work in an open office with half a dozen people talking around me at any time and with these on (and some reasonable volume music), I have to strain to hear them. I can’t understand a word they’re saying. It’s fantastic. Game changer. Also amazing on airplanes. Battery life appears to be 13 hours out of the box and has held to that as I’ve used them. You do have to get the Bose app to connect, which is really obnoxious since it basically does nothing, but you can just delete it after it pairs."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-10,Great product!!,Bought these for my son he really likes them. He does a lot of flying and likes them a lot.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-10,I bought these just for the noise cancellation part and it didn’t even work,Wish the noise cancellation actually worked
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-13,TOO MANY CALLS REPORT BAD AUDIO,"I had raved about the sound quality and noise cancelation of these headphones in my first review, which really is spectacular. But after 10 business conference calls at various locations, I had to abandon these headphones on 3 occasions because the other participants said I sounded like a Cylon Robot buzz-word-buzz-crackle-word-stutter-buzz-word. You might say 3 times isn't enough to discard a product, but my remote job depends on my performance during conference calls and 3 our of 10 failures is unacceptable. On an unrelated note, the design of these headphones puts the drivers so close to your ear, that even on my relatively small flat ears, they touched my ears and caused some pain and discomfort after a couple of hours use. This might be what is being reported as ""ear suck"" by some people."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-13,Everything was great. Bluetooth was not great.,Bluetooth terrible. I have 80 dollar Sony bluetooth headphones that are 10 times better. Never buying 400 dollar headphones again!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-14,Boes,very good sound quality
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-01-16,"Can only pair it to my phone, thanks to a mandatory app. Sound quality is incredible though.","Howdy folks! This is my first time owning a pair of Bose headphones. Noice cancellation is excellent. Noise cancellation is changeable, from 0 to 5 to 10. I just used these on the plane, and the humming and droning of the plane was silent. Once I turned these off, I could hear all sorts of noise. I was really surprised. The Alexa feature is nice, however I do not have Alexa devices aside from this. Picks up my voice just fine, even with a heavy accent. Comfort is really where these shine. They’re lightweight, and articulate in several points to fit my melon like a glove. (I guess glove isn’t the best word to use, but still)
The only downside is the connectivity to devices. Connecting to my iPhone is easy with the <mandatory> Bose app. This i really don’t like. Having to use an app seems to be the case for everything these days. Just being able to use my Bluetooth settings would be excellent. So far the only device I’m able to connect these to is my iPhone. I have still yet to successfully pair them to my Alienware. Bluetooth supports them, but I cannot find “Bose headphones” when pairing. If I figure out a fix, then I’ll update my review with an answer, and selectively will change the star rating as well. Moving on, the case that’s included is really nice. There’s a little stash for your cables (charging usb c, and auxiliary) there’s a magnetic flap to keep them from falling out. Ear cups and head band fit in as long as you place them back in their smallest size. I really love the sound quality, and the improvement this has made to my traveling experiences. I really suggest you grab a pair of you travel a lot. It is paramount the difference these have made. However if you want to connect to other devices, maybe look at another Bose product. Thank you for your time reading this review, I hope it helps in your decision to buy or not."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-16,It would of been nice to receive a owners manual in English,"I had to go on line an download a owners manual, mine was in several languages, but nothing in English, except how to download the app for you phone"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-19,On Point,This product works great.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-19,Worth the upgrade,"Upgraded from the original QC-35. Quicker connection to phone, better noise cancellation and improved mic for calls. Calls made on the QC-35 were too loud for those on the other side and there was no option to adjust mic sensitivity. The NC is a huge improvement as tested long a few cross country flights. Love the ability to quickly change the NC levels. Don't hesitate to upgrade if you are still sporting the original QC-35."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-20,Moderately,Like noise canceling. Don’t like you need a special charging cord.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-22,great when they work,"seems I'm not the only one having software issues with these headphones. for those with similar problems, here is the fix:
1. Search for Bluetooth in the start menu, click 'Add bluetooth or other device'
2. Pair with your Bose 700 as any other device, it will show up as unknown and won't play audio
3. Search for control panel in the start menu, switch to all items view and select 'Devices and Printers'
4. Your Bose should be listed there under 'unspecified', right click it and choose 'properties'
5. on the 'services' tab, select everything but 'Unknown Service'
6. Click OK and wait a few seconds
7. You should now be able to use your headset from Windows 10
explanation: on PC side: they connected, but were not an audio device, so had to go into devices, device properties, settings, and turn the device into an 'audio' device. someone on the internet had figured out that's how you can get them to work with the PC (via bluetooth). on the android front, using a galaxy note 10+, the phone can usually connect, but the Bose app I was requested to install can't find the headphones half the time. I also have the Sone 1000xm3, the main competitor to these bose, and I have no problem with those connecting to anything, and the sound is comparable (to my ears). honestly, I have AKG headphones and many others, but these Bose are the only ones giving me any problems, and across multiple devices. that's a problem. :-/
it doesn't matter how good you are if you can't connect to phones and PCs, and that's why the 1 star. it's like owning a jaguar (Car) it's great, but not if it's in the shop 3/4 of the time."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-24,Sleek design and fits smaller heads!,"I recently started working in a noisy office space and wanted to upgrade my Sennheiser (which have a very tight clampdown and are not comfortable for long periods of time. I purchased both Bose 700 and the QuietCmfort 35 II. Here's why I went with 700:
1. I'm a petite woman with a smaller head and QuietComfort was very loose on my head and oversized. For my head proportions, 700 is a lot more comfortable. 2. 700 looks a lot more modern
3. I actually prefer the flatter case design of 700 bc its less bulky in my backpack
4. On 700 you can adjust the level of noise cancellation from 0-10
The price is high but these are a sleek design and way better than my previous Sennheiser. You're also paying for the brand name. Hoping these last for years to make them worth it."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-24,Dead after 4 months,Purchase on Aug. Enjoyed while it worked. Pulled out of the bag today. It is dead.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-25,Excellent product.,Product met my expectation and was in compliance with the specification provided by the seller. Thanks ...
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-26,Solid Performance,Great fit and easy to use. Great cell phone connectivity too
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-27,Fantastic and comfortable,The best Bose yet
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-27,Good for some things; Bad for others.,"First, the sound is quite good, and the ANC works well. But the mic is useless if not in a quiet environment. It does little to nothing to filter out any background noise at all. Disappointed for the huge investment!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-27,My wife likes the headphones,She says they are good.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-27,Phone conversation is possible in very loud environments,"I work in very loud data centers and have to be able to talk on the phone while doing so. I’ve tried many different headsets, earbuds, etc. and none performed well enough to allow me to keep them on while on a call. Sometimes these calls can last many hours while troubleshooting an issue. This has impacted my hearing a great deal, but I shied away from the price of the Bose headsets due to the price to some degree, but mostly because I never saw a review that confirmed that a phone conversation is possible in these crazy loud environments. Well I finally saw a review where a guy compared these to the Sony top end NC headphones and you could hear him talk on a phone call in a loud room with the Bose, and the Sony’s you could not. All you could do was tell he was speaking. This is a deal breaker for me so I went with Bose. These have literally changed my life! I can effortlessly use both my phones at the same time (work and personal) so I can listen to my music, and take a work call, then back to music. People never complain they can’t hear me. If you have the same needs I would say buy these things. If you don’t need to be on calls in loud places, and mainly want music performance, the Sonys may suit you better, but here’s another thing; that may be age-dependant. I’m 61 and have lost a lot of my high frequency hearing from working in data centers for 40 years. I don’t need massive base, I need help with the highs and that’s what I’ve heard some people complain that the Bose are too “bright”. I can see where younger folks might think that, but to me they sound really nice. If you are young and work in loud places take it from me and protect your hearing! I’m trying to save what I have left, and these are helping."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-28,Perfect gift!!,Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he Loves them! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-28,Great headphones,Bought it for my mom for Christmas and she’s loves them. Ironically she surprised my brother with pair for Christmas and he loves his as well.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-28,Bose NC 700 mic doesn’t work,I got this specifically to use with my laptop on conference calls only to find the mic doesn’t work with most laptops.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-01,Awesome sound...great quality,The only bad thing is that the Bose Music app could be a lot better and an equalizer is missing.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-02,The well priced product,Great product
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-03,These are the best,"I've used Bose headphones before. I had an older wired pair, but these work even better and I really like the wireless feature. Batter lasts a LONG time, and these are easy to use. the best!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-04,Fantastic,My son LOVES them
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-02-04,Cool when working,"They are awesome, when the bluetooth isn’t cutting out. Every couple minutes the song glitches out because the bluetooth on these is subpar, surprising for $400 headphones. Again, amazing headphones when the music isn’t cutting out."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-05,Better stick w/ QC v1,Not worth the $ given the number of glitches it has but looks nice and sounds ok
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-05,Best headphones ever...,I like the look and feel of the overall product. A d the main thing is the sound and the noise cancellation that you get on naisy place. I work on open space area a d it works perfectly for me.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-06,Don't expect to be able to use them right out of the box,"The manual included in the box is a joke (not even a picture regarding how to charge them, what buttons are for), you will need to go to the web and download the manual. It appears you can't use this without downloading Bose Music. Wonder that happens if you don't have an internet connection. Besides the fact that using them for the first time was NOT a straightforward process, and that it took several minutes to pair this to my tablet (a SURFACE PRO 6), the bluetooth streaming when using my tablet was simply unacceptable: music sound was choppy, breaking up frequently. I will return this, won't try Bose again without much further research (it appears that pairing this to a tablet is a frequent problem)."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-08,Swweeeet,Love the clarity
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-11,Wow!,"I have never had noise cancelling headphones before so my opinion may be jaded (or naive), but these are absolutely fantastic! I can't believe how well they work and how good they sound, I am so happy I decided to spend a little more than I wanted to and move up to this tier. I am using these with an iPhone X and a surface pro laptop and both connections were simple (I read some reviews complaining about connection issues, not disparaging those, but clarifying that I have had no such issues). They are working great for phone calls as well, and the microphone is crisp and clear, or so I'm told. The only thing I would change on these is the wired connection doesn't enable the microphone, if it did these could also replace my gaming headphones on my xbox1. I never expected them to do that though, just once I felt how comfortable they are I wanted them to cover all my headset needs. I guess I'm already spoiled."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-02-12,Amazing,"I can't say enough good things about these headphones. They're absolutely amazing. The sound quality is impeccable. The battery life is fantastic. I feel like I hardly ever have to charge these. And the noise canceling is so good, it's almost trippy. These headphones are definitely worth the extra money!"
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-02-13,Substandard product,"The mic is substandard at best. I had to return one unit as I started getting static in the left ear and then another because the mic sounded as if I am a robot. I am surprised Bose is making substandard products for a premium price. The current unit seems to be working good so far. One more thing, the battery says 20+ hours when it is fully charged but take it out off charger for a couple of minutes and try, it says 19 hours. It’s still long enough but makes me feel I need to charge it every night."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-13,Do you need a migraine?,"If you do, buy these. All high frequencies, no bass. Koss $10 headphones sound better. I’ve owned many Bose headphones and the last 2 were garbage. Never again."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-15,Great headphones,My wife loves them
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-16,Good choice,Really cuts down on the sound. Make listening to on-board entertainment media much more enjoyable.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-20,5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Love them, best headphones I ever had! !"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-21,Best,Great!! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-22,Excelente,Excelente producto. Garantía Bose!
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-22,Not bad,I like three design of these headphones. They are sleek and modern. One of my dislikes is the minimal strength of base that comes from the headphones. All in all I do think this is a great product to have while on a plane or in an area where you just want to be alone with your music or your sounds.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-22,"Build Quality Perfect, Bluetooth drivers struggle with multiple connections","I purchased these headphones after going to local stores and testing them against their Sony competitition. I like the sound profile of both but the build quality on the Bose NC 700 is what drew me towards it. I have no real brand loyalty to either (in fact my wired headphones are Sennheiser). The clamping force is fairly strong. The ear cups are pressed firmly around your ears, but because of the extremely soft ear cups it does not bother me for long listening sessions. However, and strangely, the headphones are pretty silippery where they rest on your head. The rounded design does not offer much stability and I find that looking up or down will slide them around enough to dislodge them from my head--This isnt a problem for wired ""desktop"" headphones, but with these I am often on the move paired with my mobile devices. PROS:
-Noise Cancelling is insanely good--to the degree that after a long session i'm startled at the loudness of the ambient outside world. -Build Quality--I love these things. They are solid, the capacitive sensor is highly responsive. Mic quality is excellent, ear cups are super soft. clear bose sound signature. Good volume. -Stylish. -Great battery life. -Can use an audio jack if needed (though its not the standard, so you must have the smaller micro cable)
CONS:
-Slightly strong clamping force, yet slippery still while tilting head up and down (no side to side instability)
-Audio stuttering when two devices are connected via bluetooth simultaneously. Not really usable. Tested with MacBook Pro 2015 and Razer Phone. -Short audio pop when buffering a streamed video (such as scrubbing a youtube clip). This pop is not present on wired phones. -Strangely, the headphones rotate away from your body. So if you wish to put these around your neck where the ear cups lay flat on your chest, then when you go to put them on, the Right ear cup will be on your Left. Why..."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Very versatile and allow you to focus,I like the the headphones fit very versatile and look good whether working out or going to the office. The noise cancellation is very at help avoid distractions in noisy areas.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-24,"Great Headphones, bass doesn’t match up to the rest of the headphone’s pros","Only thing that surprised me was the bass. It was good quality, but the bass just didn’t have the “wow factor” I expected from a $400 headphone. And especially a Bose one. However, I’m still happy. The noise canceling was unbelievable!! Best I have heard or not heard."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-27,Very good,Solid build
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-28,"Great NC headphones, app needs fixing","I’ve been using Bose noise cancelling headphones for the past 5+ yrs. Bought these yesterday and I’ve been testing them since. Product quality and performance is what it’s expected from the Bose brand. However, app needs fixing. I’ve been experiencing pairing issues between my Apple iPhone and headphones through the app. I did the software update and I’m still getting the same sync issues. Every time I disconnect the Bluetooth feature ('turning off' the headphones) I have to delete the Bose Music app and reinstall it again since the app won’t recognize that the headphone is paired to my iPhone while the headphone voice feature notifies that it’s paired. Thus, Ím unable to use the control features from the app. I believe this is what’s happening to other users in their reviews. Hopefully Bose will address this matter soon as this will affect users’ overall experience and momentum may move towards Sony’s alternative."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-03-08,Not blocking as much noise as I expected,I use these to listen to music off my laptop while I work. I also use them on conference calls that connect through my computer. I'm getting mixed feedback from my meeting attendees on the quality of the sound. I purchased them because my office is right off our great room and wanted to cancel out the noise of the Television. I also wore them on an airplane and again not as noise-canceling as I'd hoped.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-03-08,Perfect for those with sound sensitivities,"I have a young man on the Autism Spectrum is off to University this Fall and attending a visitor day on campus made it suddenly apparent that he was going to need noise cancelling headphones if he was going to survive the noise and mayhem and still get relevant information from around him. He did the research and found that the Bose 700 noise-cancelling headphones would exactly fit his needs. He has been using them for two months now during his public transit commute and on campus at his community college. These are definitely going to make a major contribution to his success this Fall. With their reliably long battery life, fast charging times, excellent active noise cancellation, and uplifting sound quality, these are a great mid/high-end option for anyone looking for noise cancelling headphones. BATTERY
The NC 700s last approximately 20 hours on a full charge, and while the paperwork states that the battery takes 2.5 hours to charge fully, it has never taken over an hour and a half to charge fully even when it is at zero power when I have started charging it.. The USB-C port is a welcome change as well, allowing for easy interconnection to any device. You can even charge the headphones from your laptop or cellphone. I often get surprising amounts of mileage from these headphones, even when they warn of low battery. EXTERIOR
These are medium-sized headphones, with a simple metallic finish in the case of my particular Luxe Silver set. The finish is not exceptionally cold to the touch even in cold weather, unlike true metal headphones, and the texture is smooth to the touch. The headphones come with their own case, which is slightly larger than the headphones alone, but will protect them well in any environment. This is not a carrying case since there is no handle but they fit easily in a backpack and stay well protected. I have included a picture of the headphones in the case next to a pair of Bose QC35II also in the case so that you can see that the size is almost the same. The QC 35II does fold to fit into the case and has a slightly smaller footprint. I have also included a picture showing that the 700 has a smoother exterior with touch sensitive controls instead of clunky buttons which, I hope, will mean less chances of dust and debris getting behind the buttons since he will be wearing them a lot and often outdoors. FIT
My son has a large head and these headphones fit well with minimal adjustment. Often headphones are too tight because the band is too inflexible and he cannot wear them if they feel too tight. The only available adjustment on the 700 is to raise or lower the actual speakers on the band they are connected to, but the band is surprisingly flexible and he was able to get a very comfortable fit. CONNECTIVITY
I used the headphones with two devices at once: a Dell XPS 13 laptop and LG V35 ThinQ smartphone. The headphones can stay simultaneously connected to both devices, but cannot play audio from both at once. It is, however, capable of interrupting audio from a pure media device when you receive a call. Connection was simple and straightforward; just hold down the on/off button until the headphones start pairing. There is also a wire for a standard headphone jack, but be warned; the headphones use a 2.5mm connector instead of the standard 3.5mm connector, meaning a Bose cable is needed to connect them via wire. These headphones CANNOT BE USED WHILE CHARGING - even using the included wire, they will simply not play audio. AUDIO QUALITY
For music, these headphones are exemplary. They have a relatively flat frequency response in my experience, effectively balancing bass, mids, and treble without emphasizing any of them. Although it may be somewhat difficult to hear very fine details in some tracks - details that would be audible with even higher-class audiophile headphones - the 700s provide good quality for the price, especially considering their active noise cancellation. NOISE CANCELLATION
One of the main selling points of the 700s is its powerful active noise cancellation. It is advertised to be capable of 10 different levels of cancellation - 11 including 0 - but I found that there was often little difference, and I only needed 0, 5 and 10. At 10, the headphones can effectively cancel the noise inside a train, and can significantly dampen the sounds of even power tools. My son - resident handyman- tested it outside while using a leaf vacuum and found the job much more bearable with the cancellation on. MICROPHONE QUALITY
The NC 700s are equipped with eight microphones: six for active noise cancellation, and two for voice pickup. Two of the ANC microphones are shared for voice pickup. The headphones are very good at cancelling outside noise on a call, as well. Even in loud environments, people on the other end can hear you clearly. DURABILITY
These are not workout headphones, but they will still do the job. The headphones are rated IPX4; they have not been tested for dust protection, but will resist splashes of water from any direction. In my experience, the covers have not degraded at all despite using them while sweating. An earlier generation of Bose headphones I had saw the earpads disintegrate fast but these have held up beautifully. The headphones are rated for significant heat and cold, including sub-zero temperatures. Although I have not had the opportunity to test them in extreme cold, Bose states that they performed specific testing and confirmed that the NC 700s continue to function in cold weather. In sum, these are advanced, powerful headphones that are entirely worth the price, but lose some audio quality in exchange for their powerful noise cancellation. These may not be the best headphones for audiophiles, but for any casual user, they will do everything you need and more. For young adults with noise sensitivities, these are a life saver - pure and simple."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-08,Great,Very good.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-11,Unbelievable headphones best ever,Great headphones Bose is the best by far
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-17,Do not order these,I don't like the headband it's not adjustable
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-21,Outstanding headphones,Very comfortable fit. Long battery life.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-21,App wouldn’t pair rendering headphones nearly useless,"Okay sound quality, but I could not get the noise cancellation to work at all after 30 minutes of struggling to connect to their app. Why do I need to 1) Download an app 2) agree to multiple pages of privacy agreements about their microphone usage 3) give them an email to sign up to use their app and finally 4) spend forever pairing the headphones to the app? Worst user experience of a new electronic product in a while. They could have just added a button to toggle noise cancellation. The app is entirely superfluous to the user and is instead focused on business goals of harvesting email accounts and phone data. And I still can’t get it to work. Will be returning these."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-21,Recommend to anyone,I am using this so I can do my schoolwork while my husband is making business calls and watching videos. It is perfect for our situation!
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-03-22,Love the sound,Nice by hard to configure with apps
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-05,Great product. Received a day early!,Great headphones.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-05,What happened?,What the hell happened to Bose? Why won't you let me turn off your headphones? These are a grotesque amalgamation of what Bose used to be. Zero stars. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-09,"Umm...these ""new"" headphones are used - they came with hair in them","So....I don't normally write reviews, but these headphones were supposed to be new, and, well - they arrived with hair in them. I literally opened them up, and somebody else's hair was in both the case and one of the earcups. The case also has a few scuffs and watermarks. These were marketed as new, and are the same price as if I bought new directly on Bose's website - I just bought on Amazon for convenience, but the seller on here clearly isn't actually Bose. Beware."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-15,Terrible for phone calls,"I bought these to use while at home for phone calls and conference calls using GoToMeeting on my Macbook Air. There are two main issues that prevent you from using these as a true bluetooth headset for voice calls. 1) Mid call your voice will become faint, garbled and the people on the other end cannot hear you. This happens regularly on both my Macbook Air using GoToMeeting and on my iPhoneX. Disconnecting the headset and switching to the native speaker and mic on the device immediately solves the problem. This is happening so often that the headphones are not really usable for voice calls anymore. 2) Occasionally the headphones will just disconnect for no reason and then maybe reconnect. This happens when the bluetooth device you are connected to is only 24 inches away. I think this has something to do with the multi-device support and turning bluetooth off an all other devices seems to help, but come on Bose, disconnecting the active device when you pickup a passive device somewhere else?? An additional annoying issue is that when you launch the Bose Music app, even though the headphones are connected to my iPhone, the music app cannot find them. I would guess all of these issues can be traced to some bug or flaw in the bluetooth connection and multi-device support. As other reviews state, the sound quality and noise cancelling are second to none, but the mic sound quality issues make these unusable for voice calls and you should avoid these until Bose corrects the flaws."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-20,"Comfortable, great background noise filtering, best headset for web meetings","My girlfriend live in a 2 story loft style condo with no walls. These headphones allow us to simultaneously take meetings without one voice leaking into the other's audio as long as we're on separate floors. This means no one has to take a call in the bathroom anymore! Audio quality is excellent and pairing with iOS and Mac devices is easy enough. Alexa integration helps us send commands without shouting across the room. This is pricey for sure, but I feel I'm going to get my money's worth out of these. These are also the most comfortable fitting headsets I've ever used. The ear pads over my entire ear and don't pinch at all (the downside to this is these probably aren't viable for workouts). Prior to these we returned pairs of Beats Solo3s that were painful to wear after the first 5 minutes."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-21,Connection Defects,"The horrid Bose Music App silences the great Bose 700s due to severe connectivity issues. Completely unacceptable for a premium brand, product, and price!"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-23,Do not buy if you're one of the millions of people working from home during this pandemic.,"These are lovely headphones for listening to music, and I wish that I could afford to spend upwards of $400 on something that I only use in my very limited free time. I justified this purchase because I'm an educator, and have to teach all of my classes and perform all of my committee work and professional development activities online, using videoconferencing software. I am on Zoom 8 to 10 hours a day. Yes, I do enjoy listening to music when I am out of the house, but during a shelter-in-place, that is only happening a couple of hours a week. Sometimes never. These headphones do not work with Zoom on a MacBook Pro. They also didn't work for talking on an iPhone. I went to the Bose Support Community in search of a fix or a workaround, and I discovered at least a dozen similar threads about Zoom, and also about Skype and Microsoft Teams. And they weren't just with Apple devices. There were a couple of Bose community admins posting questions here and there, claiming that they couldn't troubleshoot without additional information. Dozens of people provided the information immediately, but the admins never followed up. Not once. Not a single customer got their issue resolved. We were all left ""hanging,"" just waiting for a fix or a workaround that never came. After a couple of days of checking, checking, checking, I decided to just post a new thread, with information specific to my issues, hoping that someone from Bose would respond. After two days, I noticed that my post was DELETED, and that I had a message from Bose telling me that my thread was a duplicate, which was a violation of their community guidelines. The message directed me to one of the aforementioned threads about Windows OS and Skype not working with the NC 700 headphones, so I went back to that conversation to see the fix/workaround. Shockingly, nothing had been resolved. I had been directed to a conversation that contained absolutely no solution or new information. It did contain a few more posts from frustrated customers. Most of us posted that we were returning our headphones, not just because we cannot use them for work, but also---and primarily---because we realized that Bose customer support is nonexistent. Do not spend money on these headphones if you need them for work or telephone conversations, or if you expect to get help from Bose for any issues that might arise. If you're only using them to listen to music (and you're confident that you won't need to answer the phone while doing so), and you believe you can resolve any technical issues on your own, go ahead and buy them. They sound amazing."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-24,Severe Connectivity Issues,"The headphones lose connection constantly when video conferencing on my PC (Zoom, Slack, Teams) or streaming music on my iPhone using Deezer. I followed all of Bose's recommendations and nothing works (updated drivers, reset configuration, etc). They even failed over a wired connection! I had to return them. The ANC is fantastic, could listen to calm classical music without missing the details while the washing machine was on (in the same room) and a leaf blower was working outside (and my window was open). Did not get to try them in the subway or on a plane due to the current circumstances (and having to return them less than a week in because of malfunctions). Music sounds good but not great for the price range. I compared them to Beoplay H8 and Beyerdynamic DT-880 and they sounded slightly worse than the H8 and far from the DT-880, especially in terms of the soundstage. The buttons and touch control work really well. Dual bluetooth connection (to my PC and iPhone) was more of a hassle than a benefit because static noise would creep whenever I received a notification on the phone and during song changes. Materials feel high quality but the headband is very flexible and made me feel that I needed to handle them with extra care. They are probably well built and would have no problem with normal handling, but I did not feel confident like I do with my more sturdy cans."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-25,Best headset ever owned,"I was hesitant to order due to the cost. Worth every penny! Our neighbors puppy sits outside my home office window barking. I can’t hear the puppy with these on. I was worried about my voice clarity when calling without a boom mic. My father who is hearing impaired can actually hear me when I call using these. I am super impressed with the quality, the comfort, and the ease of use. My favorite Bose product ever. I would buy again."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-25,App on iPhone doesn't detect headphone after some time,"Got it just last evening. Set up everything. This morning the app on my iPhone was unable to recognize the headphone. However, I am connected because I am able to talk over phone using my headphone. Due to app not connecting, I lose the features intended to be provided through the app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. If it gives me this problem again, I am not going to waste my time with this headset and am just going to return it. I am not sure about Sony, but perhaps it will be time to switch to Sony if I have to deal with this app once more."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-04-25,Great to use for phone calls!,Great to make phone calls from home as I am working from home due to COVID. Long battery life and very comfortable to wear for hours. Bass is not great but overall good sounding when listening to music.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-04-26,The price is so infatuated,I’m just don’t what about this Device that justifies the price having Alexis doesn’t do that you will never get me to pay over 300.00 dollars for this sorry
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-26,"MUST SEE BEFORE YOU BUY- 3 Major design flaws-crown pressure, warming of ears!!","I am in the market looking for a nice pair of in ear 'true wireless' headphones or earphones that serves 2 main purposes:
a- call quality and mic quality should be good (should not muffle or alter my natural voice)
b- should have good music soundstage to listen to music of all genres in general
THREE MAJOR DESIGN FLAWS that led me to return this product and continue my search ( also compares with Bose QC 35-iis and Sony wf-1000xm3s) :
1. Though the band is built of metal, but there is quite a large crown pressure leading to huge discomfort after wearing for just 30 mins to 45 mins. This is also because there is minimal padding over the head that makes the metal band dig on the head crown after sometime
2. The clamping force over the ears lead to discomfort for prolonged listening and warms up he ears, so while speaking in conference calls due to pressure on the jaw-line
3. There is minimal padding on the band, so after just 1 week of use, there is permanent deformation on the soft lining- see picture
PROS:
1.There headphones were overall good for listening with all genres of music with excellent audiophile grade of music- the ideal Bose signature soundstage
2. Mic quality is excellent"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-06-30,Futuristic design with the upgrades we've always wanted,"I got my hands on these through BOSE.com, and honestly I expect the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 will be another hit for Bose. At only a bit higher price than QC35s, we've got to wonder who will opt for the older pair. Battery life is superb so far with only 7% down after 3hours of continuous playing. To my ears, they sounded familiar and similar to the QC35 IIs. I will need more time for a review on their overall sound quality, but I don’t think existing Bose customers will be let down. Also something I didn't expect at first was Bose AR, the company’s audio-based augmented reality platform that debuted on the frames sunglasses. Hearing real-time directions from your headphones when walking around a city does sound useful, but Bose AR is still so new and unproven. I am still trying to get a good hang of it."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-06-30,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 (HR).","Pros:
• Beautifully designed. It looks like it’s made from one sheet of stainless steel and feels pretty dam solid. No visible screws, no joints, very sleek. • There is a soft touch plastic on the device. It’s a nice feel and I have to believe they went this way to reduce weight. • Adjusting the speakers is purely simple. You just slide the ear cups up or down to your choosing. • The touch panel on the speaker is very quick. It didn’t take long to know how to use it because Bose provides a simple layout on using the touch features. • One highlight of these headphones is the voice speaking system. Inside this machine, you’re getting 8 individual microphones. 6 are for the noise canceling and the last two are for your voice. I sat in my busy office (an open floor layout) and began to make calls using this. This function is excellent. The noise canceling blocks out 80-90% of my surroundings while anyone I talk to, using this headphone, had no idea that I was in the center of my office space during our rush hour. Very clean in speaking with it, and my colleagues on the phone notice it as well (doesn’t really go both ways because they don’t have the 700, but you can’t win them all). • What’s really cool about the noise canceling feature is that you have levels on how much you want to block the outside world. This is a great treat to have because there were times that I needed to forget the world when I was on my break, and there were times that I was waiting for someone to call me. The layout is a high, medium, to full transparency. I always stick to medium when I’m not at home, and go to the high levels when I know I wouldn’t be needed. My advice is to use the full transparency when walking because this headphone’s noise canceling system is so good that it can be dangerous if you don’t know your surroundings. • With the noise canceling feature, I’m also not getting any distortion from playing music. • I will only use the highest noise canceling settings either at home or on a plane. You can’t hear anything going on when this feature is active. • Overall the system is built to never leave your head. • You can use all the AIs if you want (Google, Alexa, Siri). I have each one of them on a different product, and all were able to hear me clearly after I turned an external speaker extremely high in order to see how the headphones will take with a large amount of external sound coming at it. • I’m getting around 4 days of use (that’s around 4 hours a day). Battery life is respectable. • Bluetooth is fast and I’m happy to also note that that having the Bluetooth feature on all the time doesn’t drain the battery. I know some headphones and phones have this issue. But not this one. • The case it comes with allows the headphones to fold flat and has a small pocket for the cable. Very premium
• You do have a wire mode if the battery does die. Surprisingly now the issue is finding a phone with a headphone jack. • Comfort is spot on. I was never an ear cover headphone type of guy because my ears start to get hot. The comfort that it provides me makes this a minimal issue at most. • The app is very customizable to these headphones. One example is the battery life of the headphones. On the app it will not only tell an accurate battery lifetime frame, but you can make the headphones shut off automatically if they're not in use within a specific time frame that you created. • The app also allows you to create a number of sound profiles. As I said, very customizable
• You can also get to battery life, told to you, from the headphones themselves. • The charging on these headphones are really quick. I did a 15-minute charge and that gave me an extra 2 hours of battery life. • The sound is very smooth, clear, and what you get from any headphones from Bose (will explain more below). Cons and Oks:
• You can’t fold up this device. It’s a sleek design but there are no hinges as the only option of storage using the case that it comes with. • No aptX or aptX HD support
• Bose hasn’t yet found a solution in allowing the option to temporarily amplifying your surroundings when you need to. Sony has done this in their past headphones, but Bose has yet to get on board. • I notice that these headphones do get off heat. When you’re using the noise canceling feature, the heat will grow. • Bose headphones always provide the best in smoothness, but not in the bass. The bass is strong, but you expect a little more than what it offers. Obliviously this depends on the type of music you’re listening to. But for real hardcore beat music, you might get a step down in performance because the bass sounds a little tighter. • These headphones tend to sand down the music you’re playing to (Listening to Kayne West, Lady Gaga, Jay Z songs that require a full range of sounds). It’s the signature way of what Bose does, but it’s still incredible to listen to it them. Note that the noise canceling feature really does help. • Speech to text works pretty well. There is some miscommunication, but this is hard to go out on the headphones as it also depends on the program you’re using (was just using a basic voice speech program on my mac). • There is a weight to these headphones, but fortunately, the weight is scattered evenly. • The touch swipe feature is a nice change of pace, but I know those who live in cold environments will not enjoy this. Having mittens/gloves on won’t work with the touch sensor, so you’ll need to remove them in order to use it. The climate region on where you live may be an impact if you want to buy these. • Make sure you download the right app. Bose has so many of them and it’s easy to download the wrong one since they all have similar names. • It does deliver a suburb voice assistant support but I didn’t focus on this since 1. You have Goggles, Siri, and Alexa on standby and 2. This is new, and I already saw some bugs in this layout. Bottom Line:
It’s Bose. Bose is the father of premium sound for decades so you’re getting the best of the best in sound. The design is sleek, the sound is great, and the noise canceling is excellent. One of the best features is using the microphone/calling setup. I recently reviewed the Denon AH-GC30, and the microphone/calling setup is the way for these new headphones. There is not much to complain because anyone who has a Bose knows that everything you spent on a Bose comes from the hardware within. Yes, I wish the bass was a little better, and the design issue of not being able to fold it is annoying. But the overall sound is a Bose sound, so if you have the money, pick these up for yourself. Overall: It’s Bose, the Ferrari of sound. A need for music lovers and a must for those who want quiet in a busy world. Hope I was a help to you. Love,
Honest Reviewer."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-06-30,A well rounded ANC wireless headphone,"Received these Saturday from Bose after I pre-ordered them when they were announced. I am thoroughly impressed so far. Packaging is simplistic and straight to the point with two peel back tabs that let you inside. From there, you will see the NCH 700's case which was smaller than I thought because they don't fold up like the QC35II's. The case fits in my work bag just fine. However, I do have say it's not as small overall as the QC35II's case. The NCH 700 case has a little magnetic flap inside that stores the audio and USB-C cable. No airplane adapter. Thank you Bose for going USB-C with the NCH 700's. What's left is manuals and warranty cards. The feel of the NCH 700's is nice. It's a streamlined design that grew on me and looks very modern. Weight is slightly more than the QC35II's. Build quality is significantly superior with more metals being used and most importantly, the comfort is similar. I would maybe give the slight edge to the QC35II in comfort due to the lower weight, but the NCH 700's is still a very comfortable headphone. The headband adjustment is smooth and should accommodate a wide variety of head sizes just fine. Ear-cup openings is similar to the QC35II with the left and right labels inside the ear cups for easy notation on how to put the headphones on. Controls are great and I can say the touch controls are very responsive and intuitive. Swipe up for volume increase. Swipe down for volume decrease. Swipe forward for the next track. Swipe backward for the previous track. Double tap to play and pause. Tap once to accept and incoming call. Tap and hold to reject the call. Tap and hold to go to a shortcut predefined in the app. The current shortcut available was to have the voice prompt alert you of the current battery life in which she tells you the estimated time until the battery is dead. There's 3 dedicated buttons on the NCH 700's. The two on the right is responsible for Power on/Bluetooth pairing and voice assistance/mute mic. The one on the left is to cycle between the 3 preset noice cancelling modes defined with the app. The right earpiece houses the USB-C port and the left earpiece houses the audio input port. The app provides a lot of functionality control. You can on the fly scroll though the noise cancelling/ambient modes from 0-10. 0 being like having no headphones on at all and 10 being in your own little acoustical chamber. You can launch Bose AR apps and experience augmented reality with he NCH 700's. Pretty cool. You can select the sources that are connected and add a new source or remove an existing source. The NCH 700 can connect to up to 2 devices at once. You can set your voice assistant between Siri, Google Assistant or Alexa. You can set how much of your voice is heard during phone calls or voice assistant interaction. If you're familiar with the QC35II's Bose Connect app, it's pretty much similar settings you can control. Sound on the NCH 700's is clean, open and balanced when at moderate volumes. No frequency really stands out so you get an accurate representation of your music. I would say they sound similar to the QC35II but with a tighter bass. The Sony WH1000Xm3 in comparison sounds more warm and full with a more engaging and alive presentation similar to being at the concert. The Bose sounds more accurate and clear and more like being in the studio. A flat and accurate sound will not sound exciting to everyone however so do keep that into consideration if you're eyeing the Bose.. Sound is subjective overall so you can't go wrong with what you enjoy listening to. I really enjoy the NCH 700's sound. It's a smooth and clear sound that plays well with all genres. The main issue I have with the Bose NCH 700 sound is that when you want to crank the volume, the bass literally begins to disappear in the mix due to the active EQ implementation from Bose. I personally do not like this as it makes these headphones sound harsh and tinny. Noise cancelling is insanely good on the NCH 700's. The Sony WH1000Xm3 is still a bit more effective at reducing outside noises especially in the midrange and treble frequencies. Unfortunately, both headphones get those distortion artifacts when the ANC pressure within the ear cups is disrupted from sudden vibrations to the headphones. For example this can be caused by being on a bus while on a bumpy road or running with your headphones on. The ambient aware mode is very natural feeling on the NCH 700 and it's great being able to have awareness while listening to audio in situations where you don't want to blocked completely from the world. Would be cool if it had the Sony's right hand palm over the ear cup feature where it seamlessly kicks in ambient sound and lowers the music volume so you can quickly hear someone or something and then once your hand leaves the right ear cup, everything reverts back to normal. The Bose NCH 700 does this with the button on the left ear cup. If you press and hold the button for about 2 seconds, it pauses the music and pipes in the nosies around you. When you press the button again, it reverts back to the previously set ANC setting and resumes playing audio. The NCH 700's perform exceptionally for voice mic quality on calls and interacting with your voice assistant. It's amazing how clear your voice is projected onto the other line while using the NCH 700. These are killer for conference calls even if you dare take them in the middle of Times Square, NYC. Overall, the NCH 700 is a welcome evolution to the Bose headphone line up and I'm sure these will win the hearts of many. Highly recommended!"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-06-30,Great noise cancellation. Mediocre sound quality.,"Really looked forward to these headphones as an upgrade from Beats Studio 2 Wireless. Went to the Bose factory store to pick these up this morning. First, don’t let the display pair at Best Buy fool you. These sound nothing like the ones carefully tuned to the specific demo tracks. The noise cancelation and call quality is fantastic. The noise cancellation is adjustable between 0-10. At level 10 I had a noticeable headache after using them for 30 minutes. I assume on an airplane, this level would be ideal and is just causing too much pressure without a super-noisey background. Initially, I connected to the IPhone XS using Apple Music and thought they were TERRIBLE. The higher I turned them up, the less bass/full the sound was. After getting home and downloading the Bose app, there was a software update ready to install. The update took care of the volume issues and the sound is more full throughout its volume range but to make this very clear....this is not $400 sound quality. This is not even $200 sound quality. AirPods 2 have a better overall sound presentation and similar fullness. The Bose 700 are fairly neutral sounding, but the bass doesn’t ramp up well with volume. The midrange takes over and details are lost on the low and high ends. These sound best about 50-65% volume. Anything above that and the best way to describe the outcome is that the sound doesn’t scale to the volume. Most people will complain that they are not loud enough as well. I could easily play these at full volume without issue (other than terrible sound quality at that volume). Long story short, prepare to be disappointed. These are not very comfortable for extended use. The pressure from extreme noise cancellation will definitely cause headaches, and if you like music louder than moderate you should be shopping for other headphones. After a lot of waiting for these to be released; sadly they will be returned."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-02,Bose to retake the throne of noise canceling headphones!,"Bose QC35 (and before that QC25) used to be the best noise canceling headphones on the market, until Sony WH-1000XM3 arrived last year. Bose couldn't sit idly by, so here we are. I received my NCH 700 pair today and have been using them for the past few hours. Compared to QC35, they do a noticeably better job in making the ambient sound disappear. Really impressive! They are well made and feel premium and sturdy. The cushions are roomy and comfortable, and I expect to be able to wear them for a longer period of time (like on a long flight). Just like QC35, the NCH 700 can be connected to 2 bluetooth devices simultaneously. I tried with both my iPhone and MacBook. Bose says the battery would last 20 hours long per charge, the same as QC35, though I haven't tested that yet. PROS compared to QC35:
+ Noticeably better noise canceling and a range of 11 levels you can choose from (0 to 10); Still have to test them on a windy day, where both QC35 and WH-1000XM3 suffer. + Can disable noise canceling altogether (set to level 0) in wireless mode; QC35 could only do that when connected through a wire. So NCH 700 might be safer to wear outdoors (with NC level set to 0). + Touch controls as opposed to physical buttons; very intuitive to use and would likely improve with future software updates
+ Improved bluetooth range and increased buffer (to cache songs when you briefly go out of the bluetooth range of your device)
+ USB-C charging port which is the standard these days; I wish they included a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box
+ More futuristic design and premium looking; built with more metal and less plastic
+ Slightly better sound quality
+ Easy setup and great iOS app! Now the CONS:
- Slightly heavier (0.55 lb vs 0.52 lb)
- Slightly less comfortable; the head cushion is not as wide and supportive as QC35
I'm happy with my purchase. Typical Bose product with their signature sound quality. I hope retailers drop the price of QC35 soon; otherwise, for their current MSRPs ($350 vs $400), I'd definitely pick NCH 700 over QC35 again!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-04,Tons of great features which keep the headphones around your ears.... but for how long?,"I've owned these for half a day so far and have decided to keep them around. I'm an audiophile who spends money on kickstarter earbuds, custom-made preamps, and (in general) quality hardware which reduces my audio experience as little as possible. Trying these cans in-store at BestBuy allowed me to appreciate the hardware quality of the exterior... quality matte plastic moulding, amazing comfortable faux-leather surfaces on your skin, and a synthesized voice and audible feedback to assist with your navigation of the three hardware buttons and touch controls make these headphones easy to wear during work sessions, public transit commutes, or in a crowded home with loud kids. As a brand new product, the tension on the cans over your ears and on your head can become uncomfortable within an hour of use. Subjectively, I don't consider my head to be particularly large or larger-than-average and will need to play around with adjusting the cups to sit lower or higher on the band which also release/tighten the tension respectively to see if this becomes a long term problem with use. Taking short breaks with the headphones off (10-15 minutes) helps and gives a good excuse/reminder to take a break from work to relax the body/eyes/ears. The sound quality is reasonable for the headphones. When using the headphones with noise cancellation off, ambient noise seems to lack a very strong low end frequency response (sub ~250Hz, not measured) and might reduce your meatspace experience in some cases where mixed ambient and input audio are desired. That said, direct input still seems to perform quite well with solid frequency response all around which lets the very highs and very lows to be pretty well-balanced. A test using the headset for phone conversation over bluetooth yielded very nice results. The setup involved the cans paired with my laptop streaming music and my Project Fi Pixel 3 phone on standby. Using the Google voice assistant to start the call resulted in some clumsy voice detection/understanding problems (""I'm sorry, I didn't get that, who would you like to call? I don't know that name, who would you like to call? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Ok, will that be mobile or home? Dialing..."" _sigh_) which I don't believe are the fault of the cans at all. The test included loud ambient music in the room with the person wearing the headphones and found the other user to experience practically none of the ambient noise through the call with a very clear bead on the callee's voice despite close proximity to the music source playing at a moderate volume (such that the ambient music was leaking through the room walls and making it hard to isolate whether the headphones were leaking the ambient noise into the call...which it seemed _not_ to do with this casual test setup). Noticeable was the (300-700ms) delay from the user on the headphones which seemed to not be present from the non-headphone user. It was hardly a concern and either due to the latency in the network transmitting the audio (which, again, was a local wifi call between handsets.... though I am unsure if the handsets route audio locally or not) or possibly in the audio processing from the headset. This latency was par for most mobile calls and should be completely unnoticeable in a remote environment when you're not there to hear to source before the transmitted audio through the headset. A few gripes about the design and ergonomics of the device:
- the button placement: very easy to accidentally active these buttons which adjusting the placement of these cans if not aware/careful. - the direction of earcup rotation: when placing the cans around the neck/shoulders, the earcups rotate up (into the air) rather than down (onto your chest). Questionable choice here as it makes the headphones somewhat uncomfortable to hold there, but perhaps Bose never expects you to remove the phones... unsure if that's a reasonable expectation or not. - the synthetic leather matte black surface inside the top of the headset and on the earcups attract oil and will certainly show for those of us with that sort of skin. This may require some extra TLC and upkeep to keep as pristine as one might like. The white set might fair better in this regard. Overall summary:
A pricey purchase that I would have trouble justifying as a personal expense (these were expensed by my employer and intended for daily voice conference usage and isolation during work hours in busy coffee shops) and really comes down to the longevity of the product over time. If these headphones end up lasting me longer than 5 years, I would be VERY satisfied with the purchase. At a price point closer to $250-300, this would be a much easier personal purchase to make. As a user which ""babies"" their hardware, I am eager to see whether this will stand the test of time. Direct input (from a bluetooth source that is not ambient noise) has a very solid frequency response which does not noticeably detract from the music experience. Longterm use may be uncomfortable depending on your head size. The noise cancellation works wonderfully and almost too well, leaving me at a ""5"" setting more often than a ""10"" as complete cancellation feels too isolating and uncomfortable to feeling the lack of ""air"" around me. BLE connection to multiple devices (two) at once allows for seemless transitions between either input. This is also a first time purchase of a Bose product. Looking forward to seeing how the device matures and support is handled over time. Firmware updates are provided automatically to the headset through their app. Battery life ""appears"" long but I have yet to complete a full discharge cycle to be sure. I was pleasantly surprised to find the phones report +5 hours of use remaining at 20% battery charge and +20 hours at full charge (the audio assistant delivers the charge level as ""hours of use"" remaining, not battery level...which is still viewable in the Bose Music app. Nice touch, Bose)."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-07-05,"Initially disappointed, improved after update, still needs a bug fix","I was really excited to get these cutting-edge headphones and found them to be, unfortunately, unusable. I connected them to my iPhone 7. The Bose Music app failed to connect at least half the time; photo provided here. In addition, the bluetooth settings screen shows two connections at the same time; I have no idea why. The app frequently throws error messages indicating that the update failed, and the connection failed. It's actually connected, but the app does not know it. The headphones' hardware buttons for switching favorites and activating voice assistant sometimes worked and sometimes did nothing, even when pressed repeatedly. Otherwise, the basic form of the headphones is good: reasonably comfortable-- though just slightly less comfy than my Sony WH-1000XM3-- and with good sound. The touch controls seem fine, though I wish I could disable the battery status control, and this is currently impossible. Overall, for me, this is a real dud-- defective product. Update 03 Aug 2019:
I reassessed after updating the phone app. Most of the earlier problems appeared resolved. I took a 4.5-hour flight where I sat next to the jet engine, which was quite loud. The Bose noise cancelling was outstanding. I could hear my music very well with hardly any outside sound. I'm not a sound engineer, but I found the music to be exceptionally pleasing in its tone and quality, with clear and balanced sound. I did not have any issues with volume. The touch-based sound controls worked well, though they take a bit of practice. I still wish I could disable the battery notification. Comfort was better than expected: I had no discomfort from the headband even after 4 hours, like I do on my Sony. Battery life seemed great. The case is slimmer than Sony's, adequate for the airplane seat pocket. Overall, I was favorably impressed and will stick with them for now. There is still an app bug that prevents the app from consistent connections with the headphones. The biggest problem with the app, as noted by others, is the required Internet login to use it!"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-06,"NC-700s & QC-35s Have Similar NC & Sound Quality, but QC-35s are more Comfortable & Intuitive to Use","I own the original Bose QC-35 headphones (not Series II). I ordered the Bose NC-700s and tried them for several days. I immediately noticed they were heavier particularly in the headband which is made of stainless steel. Even with padding the 700s put more pressure on the top of my head. The 700s are a tighter fit on the head, referred to as clamping. I found this also uncomfortable compared with the QC-35s. The 700s are also somewhat ungainly and no longer have a low profile fit. I found I continually had to readjust them. Bose has removed the dedicated buttons for volume control and use on the 700s. This is a significant downgrade. There is always going to be an error rate in using a touchpad even with practice. The lack of volume controls is a polarizing issue in car Infotainment systems as well and many manufacturers have had to bring them back. Even Apple has volume control buttons. On the 700s, it takes longer to carry about basic volume functions and a finger swipe up or down only move the volume by one step at a time. The music and noise canceling quality of the QC-35s and 7000s are roughly the same. Bose itself uses the language ""slight improvement"" in comparing NC in particular. Comfort and ergonomics and the factors that distinguish these two sets of headphones and the 700s come out worse on both. It is true that Bose has made a major breakthrough in reducing the noise surrounding the person speaking so the person on the other hand hears the speaker with unprecedented clarity. If that is your primary decision metric, go with the 700s. Bose says re: the 700s: “slightly better noise cancelling than QC35 II while also allowing you to transition from full isolation to full transparency” - Full transparency is a marketing slogan. Since Bose, unlike Sony and some of other other manufacturers, doesn’t manipulate the sound being “piped in” also known as “adaptive” noise cancellation, they are simply offering 11 NC modes from having maximum NC to no NC other than the passive NC of the headphone body itself. In others words, full transparency is a gimmick. As a practical matter, most users won’t bother to cycle thru all 11 of those modes, which requires you to open the app. Doing so takes time. The Bose app takes several seconds to “connect” each time. Most people are going to use the dedicated button on the headphones which offers exactly the same functionality - Full - Half (5/6 on 700s or None. Whatever the difference is at the no NC setting, it is de minimus) as the QC35 IIs. The original also QC-35s also offer this three step NC variability, but only thru the app. Having 11 modes is overkill in any case (Paradox of Choice). Essentially, what you get with the 700s is a heavier headphone (by 1/2 ounce) which can be held in the stainless steel headband, ie more pressure on the top of your head and a less intuitive user interface (UI) making the user experience (UX) worse. I also don’t find the addition of a Voice Asst button very useful. It just takes too long to wait several seconds for the beep prompt and then say “back 30 seconds” and then wait another 2 seconds. I can do that with my Apple Watch app in 1 second flat. I returned my 700s. Cleary not worth the cost of an upgrade."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-06,"Poor Connection, blast sound before connected","Signal get lost after I get out of my room. Awful connection with my computer, still bad mic pickup which dont lets you listen and talk at the same time. Sound come and go, but performs good with my phone. I mean it could be a quality control problem since no body elese has talked about it. But it really sucks to own a disfunctioning pair of new released headset. 0/10 would return again"
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-07-08,Sound great... when you can connect.,"Extremely frustrating connecting to both iPhone and Macbook Pro. Bose had better fix this as the Sonys are flawless in this area. EDIT: I returned the headphones after 2 days. The noise cancellation is great and they sound great, too. (although not as good as the Sonys) The app is astoundingly bad and doesn't allow you to connect much of the time. Bluetooth (on iPhone) also shows two different connections to a Bose headphone.(!?!?!) The app will also tell you that they can't find the headphones when you are already listening to music and also requires. It's really confounding. Sony's app has many different options and allows you to EQ the sound to your liking - the Bose app doesn't. I can't understand how Bose let this happen with a $400 set of headphones, right out of the gate."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-08,Surprisingly Unacceptable Demands from Bose,"I had been eagerly waiting for this new model to be released, but I have to say that it's going right back. First, I was shocked to discover that Bose forces you to download their app to even make the headphones work at all - the headphones will not function at all without it. Good luck if you are in an area without a live internet connection. I was not happy having to do this, but I downloaded the app. I then found out that you are FORCED to open a Bose account or your new headphones will stay non-functional! Further, unless you agreed with their privacy policy, AND give your headphones full-time access to your microphone, AND allow your location history to be downloaded, etc., YOUR HEADPHONES ARE NON-FUNCTIONAL!!! Even the new design is a step backward in my opinion as it tries to make the headphones do too many things with swipes and taps to the ear cups, etc. Sure, you can vary the volume by ""swiping"", but good luck in making small changes to get a desired level."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-08,UPDATE: NOW SERIOUS QC ISSUES,"MAJOR QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES: I liked the Black ones so much I bought a Silver pair. They've *both* started to malfunction in a dramatic way: Sudden, painful screeching feedback while using, akin to what happens when you hold a microphone up to the speaker. For this problem to appear with both headsets, in a similar timeframe, suggests that something is seriously wrong here. Maybe it was a software update? Warning folks: These are now officially a Beta release, and this is coming from a HUGE Bose fan. UPDATE: So my second pair of NC700's came and it functioned flawlessly. I like it so much I bought a second pair in silver. However, I have a new beef with Bose, and new users should be warned:
YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP WITH A BOSE ACCOUNT JUST TO USE THE FEATURES ON THIS HEADSET, AND THE APP ROUTINELY MALFUNCTIONS IN WAYS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM USING ALL FEATURES. GOD HELP YOU IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR SETTINGS AND YOU CAN'T ACCESS THE INTERNET TO LOG IN. (1) Dear Bose, maybe some McKinsey or BCG consultants (or worse, your own internal strategy team) told you that you need to be a content company. Thus, you must 'own' your users, so they are captive in your ecosystem. I think you should focus on hardware, but TO REQUIRE users to have an account with you just to use a pair of headphones? That is unacceptable, and in really bad faith. I know the response (I work in this world): We need to store user information to enhance the user experience, by enabling us to store logins with streaming services and digital assistants. It's a security issue. Agreed, BUT nothing about that should stop you from letting us OPT OUT and just use the headphone in 'headphone mode', and still be able to change our settings, deactivate voice prompts, etc., without logging in. Nothing about that functionality requires an account with Bose, or a login. We both know that, Bose and I, because the app for the QC35ii's did not require it. (2) To add injury to insult (yes, that's what I mean), the app does not work. (a) It routinely logs me out so I have to type my login and password (if I can remember it, I have so many) on my tiny little phone keyboard so I can stop the automatic shut-down tones from waking me up in the middle of my flight to Heathrow - wait, I CAN'T log in, because I have no internet connection. I'm 36,000 feet up over Newfoundland. So much for using my $400 headphones to get a good nights sleep on my way to London. You know a lot of your users use these things on planes, right? (b) Even when I can login, it routinely fails to find the headphones, despite the fact that my iPhone X itself can quickly connect, disconnect, and reconnect to them via Bluetooth. C'mon Bose, don't abuse your loyal fans with this kind of thing. Give us an app that can handle all functionality that doesn't require partner logins (Spotify, Alexa) without logging in. Options like: ""Log in to access personalized services"" or ""Just use my $400 headphones, please"". -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a huge Bose fan - I own 4 pairs of QC35ii's. I received this pair one week from the release date, and they are defective out of the box. Erratic low frequency pulsing from right ear, not fixed by reboot or other technical support remedy. I've already ordered my next pair, but seriously, Bose? It's a $400 pair of headphones. There is no excuse for poor quality in a new release. Pay careful attention to your purchase, folks, this defect was subtle but unmistakable."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-08,Form over function,"If you are used to the QC line, these headphones will feel heavy and cumbersome to use. Expanding the band feels awkward and more difficult than it should be, with it never feeling that secure on my head and sliding off every so often. Instead of the immediate feedback a click, you have to slide it up & down a pole. The clamping force is much higher and difficult to get used to. I also had connectivity issues initially (eventually fixed by updating headphones through bose.com and removing all Bose 700 bluetooth devices from phone then uninstalling and reinstalling Bose Music app). The ANC is noticeably better and really like the conversation mode. The power button being just a button is a great improvement IMO and it seems like it won't fail like the switches on the QC35. I hope those features come to the next QC headphones (QC45? )."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-08,Don't buy these - Get Sony or QC35,"I can't even connect these to my phone. The app doesn't work and these headphones won't recognize my phone. It constantly says ""ready to connect"" and my phone says ""connection unsuccessful"". Stick with the Sony headphones or the QC35. These are useless."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-08,Noise cancelling not so great,Disappointed with these. Noise cancelling clearly not as good as the QC-35 II.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-08,best audio bluetooth headphones / noice canceling on the market .. period,"I had the QC35 ii and tried the B&O and other high end brands before upgrading my QC's and these were simply the best... sound, quietness, and build quality."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-07-09,Pretty good,"As a brand new user to both noise cancelling headphones and over the ear headphones, I was pretty impressed. When on, you have the option to adjust from O to 5 and then to 10 to reach the full nc stage (though I’ve ready that this can be adjusted in the Bose app). At 10, it was almost compelled noice cancelling without music on and completely nc with music. Awesome. That said, I noticed that I was getting a bit nauseous at level 10 as it’s pretty stiffling and there’s a bit of pressure that I haven’t experienced. Perhaps I’ll get used to it. In terms of the design, I tried these on as well as the later cult model and preferred these as a new user. The design is sleek and less “clicky” if that makes sense. I will say that after a couple hours of use at level 5 nc, my ears were a bit warm. Not sweaty, but warm. Overall, I’m not sure if these are worth the hefty price tag plus tax but we’ll see. I’ll be taking these on a trip in a couple of days so they’ll be put to the true test with public transit and airplanes. Stay tuned for an update."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-09,"Bose quality, comfort, and sound",Bose has really stepped up their design game these past years. And the NCH 700s are a strong example of that. I bought the black pair and love the subtle differences in blacks used. Comfort is top notch. And the mic pickup is ridiculously good!! Worth the extra $50 over the Sony’s.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-09,Does only connect to mobile devices?,Am I the only one who can't figure how to play these from my Mac or Windows machines via bluetooth with ANC on? Or do those 400 dollar headphones not work on anything but supported mobile devices? Bose?
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-09,Some improvement over previous models but Bose App environment is limiting,"Sound quality marginal
Noise cancellation good but could be better
Do not want to be tied into Bose App environment
Without going into the App environment there are a number of limitations"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-10,What the?,"Bose should have concentrated more on the sound quality. I use my headphones at full volume, and the bass disappeared."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-10,An audiophile and realistic review,"These headphones specialize in noise-cancellation, which I must say makes you seem like a superhero. You can block out almost all noise with music playing. I can't hear anything in a noisy kitchen with smoothie blenders running. However, the sound signature is uniform. The highs, mids, and lows shine at the same wavelength. No these don't have thumping bass, but just enough bass so it doesn't cover up vocals. Vocals are very clear. I'm giving it 5 stars because it was advertised this way. Bose didn't say it has industry-leading sound, but the noise cancellation is killer."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-10,Great to listen to music. Poor phone call connection.,"I bought these and returned them after a week. I primarily use them for work to make phone calls. I had a number of people tell me ""you are breaking up really bad"". Nothing had changed except the headphones. As soon as I disconnected and used the regular phone, everything was fine."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-10,"Why Bose, Why?","I still can not believe that I have to return a pair of Bose headphones due to COMFORT reasons, of all things! I am an avid Bose fan, for decades, and have enjoyed, and continue to enjoy many of their products all the way from Lifestyle Home Theater systems to QC35-IIs and most recently the NC 700 that I had pre-ordered the say these came out. Like others, I did also have my initial hiccups with the connections and coping up with the awful strategy of the Bose app and account creation to be forced onto me, but, fine. I did get the phone eventually connected, and the sound was just what I expected, including the lack the deep bases of my Sony XM3s. The noise cancelling is a tad better than the very high bar that the XM3s have set. But I must say that the call quality was out this world, when I called my wife from a noisy airport. But then it all went downhill from there. These headphones are NOT COMFORTABLE. I tried these multiple times on 4 different 5+ hour legs of flights, and I could not keep these on for more than an hour. The ear cups are certainly tighter than that of the QC-35IIs, and I have no idea why they chose to go this route. Another observation is you simply can not wear these while you are lying on pillow. Yes, I often enjoy the last half hour before I go to sleep with my headphones on catching up with various things on Youtube. This is possibly because the headphones wrap more towards the back of your ears? May be. But, I can not understand why on earth Bose would not do enough user study to make sure their premium offering would severely lack in one of the departments that they have ALWAYS done so well. The new design also seems to put more pressure on your ears, and also a nag to pack it back and forth due to the amount of force you need to put on it to fold in and out of the case. Sorry Bose, but you disappointed me big time this time :/"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-10,The mic is incredible in noisy rooms,"First thing that jumped out at me was how light these are. My old Beats felt like having a pair of car seats strapped to my head compared to these. One would be afraid that the loss of weight would lead to a cheap feel, but the hinges and other components feel solid. When I first put them on in the office, the effect was eerie. These are much quieter than I expected. I experimented with them throughout the day, and I only noticed hearing my office mates once when the closest one talked really loud on the phone, but before I knew it, I didn't notice him anymore. And as good as that was, the 700's were even better on the subway. I had a few phone conversations at the office with them, and I was able to talk in a very low voice without affecting the conversation. That was nice. However, when I tried talking on the subway, I couldn't believe how normal my conversation was. After a little while, I actually forgot I was having a conversation on a subway car. Where previously in tightly enclosed stations the slowing down of the train or take off would mess up any conversation, we passed right through them without me noticing. Between the noise cancellation and the mics, I couldn't be happier. Sound quality -- it's great. Of course it's great. Most of the top headphones are now. The Sony's had more bass. The Beats have their own recipe for which regions to enhance. The Bose are clean with a solid spectrum, from strong bass to clear highs. I listen to every type of music throughout the day. I start with mellow, non-intrusive music in the morning, get more popular by midday, get into heavy beats and rap by late afternoon, and by evening, I'm listening to deep house and dubstep. The Bose are perfect for that wide a range of styles. Battery life is crazy good. When I first took them out of the box, the headphones were already telling me I had 19 hours remaining. After charging them, I'm sure they quoted me in the 20's, but I really just forgot about the battery. It will never run out. When I'm going to be away from them for an extended time, I plug them in. After 4 days of constant use, I don't think they ever got below 16 hours remaining. They paired easily. Brushing you finger up the right headphone increases volume, brushing your finger forward advances, brushing your finger back does previous, tapping twice starts or stops play, etc. Pushing on an actual button on the right-side activates Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. That button is the only problem I have with them so far. I haven't gotten into using any of those services, so I don't hit the button regularly. When do I hit this button? About 30% of the time when I'm taking the headphones off. I will eventually start using the voice-assist features or start grabbing them differently. My biggest problem with the 700's, is they weren't designed to take advantage of the PS4. You can still use the QC25 cable and play, but I really thought the new generation would work with the PS4 wirelessly straight out of the box. I read a firmware update might fix this, but that report wasn't from a reputable source. Fingers crossed. Conclusion: The best noise cancelling headphones I've owned. The best mic/headset I've owned. Best sound is between them and a wired pair of Sennheiser's, but that's really getting nit-picking. At this level, the sound quality is as good as you can want."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-10,"Fantastic Headphones, Atrocious IOS Software","Pros:
* Very comfortable
* Great sound
Cons:
* Literally one of the most annoying and broken IOS apps for accessories I've ever used. Best headphones I've ever used, software is still literally the worst. Seriously, the worst. There are free apps on the app store that is light years ahead of this. It lasted almost 10 minutes before it broke and can no longer connect to the headphones. I eventually just deleted the app in sheer frustration, I figure I'll wait until there's been a few releases to download and mess with it again. As long as you don't need to change any settings on your headphones (like noise cancelling level), this isn't a complete blocker, but for this price point, I've got half a mind to return them and buy a pair of Sony headphones."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-07-11,Still prefer the QC35 II's,"I'm going to give the 700's a little more time, but thus far I am not overly impressed. Here are my thoughts on these headphones. Design - I'm not a fan of the design of these headphones. The band is exceedingly wide and sticks out considerable over the QC35 II's and the Sony 1000MX3's. They don't look all that great when your wearing them in my opinion. Comfort - These aren't close to being as comfortable as the QC35 II's. The band is too tight on the head and caused me considerable discomfort after a few hours at the airport. I've never felt uncomfortable when wearing the QC35's, even for long stretches at a time. I think it is both the increased weight and the tightness of the band that is causing this. Also the ear cups aren't as soft as the QC35 II's. Noise Cancelling - Its excellent, but not a noticeable difference over the QC35 II's. Phone Calls - These really shine during phone calls. The background noise is drowned out and people can hear you loud and clear in noisy environments. Bose App - Absolutely awful. Disconnects constantly or says its not connected when it is. This is unacceptable for $400 headphones and one of the reasons I'm close to returning these. Music - They sound is slightly better than the QC35 II's. Bose has hit a nice sweet spot here. Battery life - not anything to write home about, but decent enough but less than similarly priced headphones on the market. Final Take - While there are some minor improvements in the Noise Cancelling and Sound Quality over the QC35 II headphones, there are some major steps backward. The look of these when being worn is very awkward, and they are not comfortable when wearing them for long periods of time. They are really great for phone calls, but I don't know many that are going to buy these because they sound good on a phone call you might take once in a while while wearing them. The app is also laughably bad and Bose should be embarrassed that they released an app that simply does not work with their $400 headphones. Not to mention you HAVE to create an account to use the app. This is incredible that Bose is making their customers do this. I'm also very disappointed in the comfort of these headphones. I'm going to give these another week but if I don't feel like the comfort is any better they are going back, as that is one of the reasons I love the QC35 II's so much. UPDATE: I'm downgrading this headphones to 1 star. Their overall comfort (for me) is EXTREMELY disappointing. They are too heavy and cause pressure at the top of the head and have far too great of a clamping force. I never had this problem with the QC35 II's or the Sony WH-1000xm3. The app, even with a recent update, is an embarrassment. It constantly disconnects and asks you to sign in over and over again. Its unbelievable that they released this app in the state that it is in. These aren't close to being worth $400 and they are going back. Save yourself some money and buy the superior QC35 II headphones or the Sony WH-1000XM3 Headphones. Both of those work great, are extremely comfortable, and put these newer Bose headphones to shame."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-11,"Overpriced, and uninspiring in terms of music. Excellent noise-cancelling and call quality though!","I bought these with high expectations as Bose has built a reputation for engineering great noice-cancelling headphones. Unfortunately, The 700s were a big let-down for me. :::::::::::PROS:::::::::::
Lightweight and portable. Sleek. Not the best build quality, but sturdier than they appear. Very comfortable. Just the right amount of pressure on your head. Possibly the best noise cancellation in the market as of their release date. I held a conversation with my wife while a lawnmower was nearby. She could not hear any indication of that lawnmower. Call quality is excellent. Possibly the best. :::::::::::CONS:::::::::::
Musically, these are severely lacking in bass. Bose Music app is lacking in feature. Theer is no parametric EQ. I downloaded a third-party EQ app in hopes of squeezing out more bass from these headphones, but Bose has employed some sort of a limiter on these headphones that keeps the volume and the bass at ultra tame levels. It's 2019, Bose ought to have some 'oomph' behind their drivers. I'm not asking for overhyped bass, but there is certainly a way to present strong, punchy bass in a tasteful manner. These cans are far from it. Feedback to Bose: people aren't buying these headphones for critical studio monitoring. They are buying them for music enjoyment, teleconferencing, and perhaps some practical considerations. This is more of an office and call conferencing headset that happens to play music as an afterthought. I've gone through so many pairs of ANC headphones recently, and I have yet to find a pair that does everything well. Every single pair I've tried (around 8 pairs now) has some glaring shortcoming or the other. That's a bit alarming considering how mature headphone tech and ANC tech ought to be at this point. Can someone please make a musically strong headphone with excellent noice cancellation, build quality, call quality, portability, comfort, and battery life? I would pay a premium for something like that!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-11,Nice upgrade from QC II,Sound quality is much better than QC ii - very open top end. You hear things in recordings that were inaudible with QC II. Quality on par with studio quality headphones. The noise cancelling seems about the same as QC II but have not used on plane. Love the new style.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-11,Good Buy,Love them. Used them while mowing and the noise cancellation is impressive. Also super comfortable and the touch controls make life so much easier. I used to use my Apple Watch to switch songs and lower/raise the volume but I don’t need to anymore thanks to the touch controls. Great job Bose !
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-11,"Bose rushed this to market before it’s ready - buggy app, inconsistent performance.","Let me count the ways this product sucks:
1. The app is buggy as hell. I’m lucky if I can connect through the app 1 time out of 10. If I connect directly through iOS Bluetooth panel, it seems to work better. 2. On the rare occasion I *can* connect through the app, it tries (and fails) to install an update to the headphones. Repeatedly. Maybe this update fixes some of the crappiness of the product....but only if it can actually install. 3. There’s intermittent popping and sound artifacts in the headphones themselves. 4. The power button doesn’t power off the headphones. You have to wait for them to auto power-off. The noise cancellation is excellent....when the rest of the bugs don’t get in the way of it. Which is almost never. Bose clearly rushed this dumpster fire of a product to market without doing the necessary QA. I’ll be returning this POS and going back to my trusty first-gen NC headphones that have lasted me for 5+ years. This product is absolutely not ready for prime time and Bose should be ashamed of themselves for rushing it to market before it was ready."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-11,Kind of Disappointing,"I've been a Bose loyalist for 2 decades. I feel this headphones in many ways are a step back. The noise canceling and the sound quality are pretty solid, but the design is flawed. These feel cheap compared to the last ones, and are really hard to adjust. It's basically impossible to adjust them while they're on your head, and it's hard to tell if each side is even. Just poor design. They do look good though. My biggest gripe with these is that they simply don't connect to me Samsung smart TV. My QC 35s didn't either. Bose is helpless to provide an answer, just as they were with the last pair. It's pretty appalling that they haven't fixed the TV connectivity issue in a few years now. I use my Sennheiser headphones with my TV, and frankly those are better headphones at half the price now. Do yourself a favor and grab the Sennheiser PXC 550s. They're discounted now, and they're a better pair of headphones."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-07-11,"Very good, for now, hoping it gets better","So i have tried the Bose QCII and Sony MX3s extensively. I loved the QCs the most purely due to comfort and dual connectivity... however both were terrible at taking calls/voice recognition/ mics etc. These definitely take the throne in that. As others have mentioned theres definite hiccups here but i am a little bit more patient. Bose is not a good software company. At first they did fit real tight as others have suggested but maybe i am getting used to it. I have used it one one flight so far and one thing i did notice was the plane rattles going through to the cup, which was a cause for concern... but as we speak i will use them on a flight again and maybe i didnt have them as snug as hey should be as i was wearing sunglasses. The noise cancelling is apparent but maybe not as insanely impressive as others have suggested- i can hear voices when music isnt playing. It totally mutes hisses, droning, etc.. but i can hear other noises- maybe thats an issue with my headphones? Not sure quite yet. This might be me, but i actually think the music quality got better the more i used them- i dont think these need burn in but i noticed it after a day of usage. They do get warmer than the QCs and they do fall forward n back more than the QCs used to. They certainly dont ""disappear"" like the QCs do but theres certainly trade offs. They QCs have an awful mic and thats a big deal for a lot. These have far superior noise cancelling than the QCs. The sonys are just too heavy for me and they fell off far easier if you lean forward or back. They also definitely do make your ears sweat. The NC 700s have similar touch buttons... i kinda hate them... possibly more so because they didnt just put them on both sides. I also think at this price these should have auto off for when you take them off akin to airpods or other such devices. I will be trying them out for a bit longer. I would go back to considering the QC35s but they've suspiciously gotten worse due to recent firmware. As far as design, they look good wearing them, but they look not so great on their own. I wished they'd have had more color options from the get go. I don't think they should be this expensive considering the features. The button lay out is a little confusing and the band sticking out as it does is not so great as in an airplane you are probably leaning on things and its a little more concerning than the QCs were but the same time these have the cusion on the outside too at some portion. All in all, i hope it gets better and i imagine they will make it happen considering the poor customer reviews so far. They can't afford to make this a failed product so i imagine they're going to crank out updates and newer features. The buttons should be customizable as you desire. The charging is fine. 20 hours vs 30 hours is similar, im charging it every other day anyhow. Hopefully the rattling that comes through isnt an ongoing issue cuz i really need something with a great mic. QCs are better comfort and fit wise but these have the tech you'd want in them. Who knows maybe we see an upgraded QC as well."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-12,Had the QC2 and then upgraded.. now im downgrading back.,"just bought the New 700.. all the controls are cool.. (but it's something to learn)
however the head band is jsut so tight.. it squeezes your head.. basically gave me a headache within 20 minutes. the ear cuffs you can move it up and down, but still it's so much pressure I couldn't take it. The sound quality and the noise cancellation is awesome.. EXCEPT.. when you do an Alexa commend, it will sound all distorted like if the speaker was busted.. very strange. I'm returning and going back to Qc2."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-12,A review by a Bose fan... and Sony still wins!,"It kills me to admit this - last year's Sony 1000 XM3 headphones are light years better than the brand new Bose 700 headphones. Comfort is better, the fit is much more comfortable, music is a touch better, has more options to control tone, and noise cancelation is superior. I’m not a very large person and have average ears... , but after 30 minutes, i got ear fatigue with the Bose because the ear cup is too small. Bose really missed the mark with this release."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-12,Replacement headphones work great.,"UPDATE**
Process to return and replace was very efficient. After using these headphones for 30 days, I am now very happy with my purchase. Sound quality depends somewhat on the source; streaming from Amazon music, at least to my ears, seems better that from Apple music, and is very good to excellent depending on each individual piece of music. Updates to the IOS app seem to have greatly improved the stability of the software. It does take a while to get used to the feel of the headphone. Minor positional adjustments to the position of the ear pieces can affect comfort. Can wear these for an extended period without discomfort. Whilethe on-off button is not in the best location, after a while you get used to it. The swipe controls work great. I can now upgrade my review to 5 stars. Previous Review:
As others have said the IOS app is temperamental, especially when trying to set up 2 devices. Firmware update done from app but sound is poor, high notes sound tinny. Could be due to a defect. Another pair belonging to friend sounds great - firmware update was done by computer. For some reason could not be updated in Safari but Chrome worked. The on off button is poorly located and it is easy to turn off or on by accident. Noise cancellation is excellent. Like that headphones can be stored in case without bending. I also like the small compartment with magnetic closure for storing cables. I am returning but exchanging for the same model. I will update firmware from computer and hope for better sound quality."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-13,Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700,"I’ve been testing the Bose 700 headphones for ten days in a variety of environments. These are my first pair of noise cancelling headphones, so I have nothing to compare the noise cancellation to, but they are excellent in noisy areas. My other headphones are Sennheiser HD 598 paired with FiiO E10K USB DAC amplifier, which I used to compare the sound. I also use SoundMagic E80s and 1MORE Triple Driver In-ear headphones. I’ve used the Bose 700’s paired with my ASUS laptop and LG V30 phone. After setting up the Bose Music App and downloading the update, they have been flawless. They easily pair with either device. The range is what I expect. I can listen to music in my bedroom from the computer downstairs. I haven’t had them cut out anywhere in the house, but they won’t make it out to the garage. I’m no audiophile, and my ears are old, but I am impressed with the sound quality. Using the Poweramp app on my phone gives me lots of adjustments to the sound signature. Wired they trigger the V30’s DAC high impedance mode. Touch controls work well, although I had to watch myself in a mirror for a bit to get the hang of it. Although I haven’t made or taken a lot of phone calls, the ones I did, sounded great and the people on the other end could not tell I was using the headphones. Battery life is excellent. The Bose app is a bit kludgy and the documentation (manual) could be better. The app can always be updated and I hope Bose continues to improve it. For me, the only Con is after an hour the headband pressure on the top of my head begins to bother me, but I rarely listen longer than that. Also, the supplied 3.5 mm cable is short and flimsy. I’ve already replaced it. Overall I’m completely satisfied."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-13,Very happy with them,"I had QC35 2 before. I bought these because I lost the QC35s. They look and design is very sleek and cool. They fit very well and are super comfortable. I love the sound quality and noise cancellation. Since I started using them, people I make phone calls with noticed a great improvement in call quality and reduction of surdounding sound and noise. Overall, very happy with it"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-13,"Excellent hardware 5/5, highly problematic app 0/5","The title contained some spoilers: the hardware is elegant and its polish and performance are outstanding. Congrats, Bose! However, the app does not live up to these standards. First, one seemingly needs to create a Bose account before being able to use it. This I consider close to being a harrassment of a consumer who just spent a non-trivial amount on an essentially single-use item. I have enough accounts already, thank you. Second: the list of the 3 preferred noise cancelling modes (default: 0, 5, 10) right now does not seem to be customizable to include NC=OFF (0 lets ambient sound through). This NC=OFF is actually hidden behind another UI layer (ie, not even directly accessible via the main app screen). This should be rectified (eg, ""OFF, 0, and 10"" might be a perfectly cyclable list of modes). At least this should be fixable. Once the app (NC=OFF option easier to access, best without app) is fixed, I'll gladly give it a 5/5. I wrote the same feedback on Bose's site, but my comment there is still ""being moderated."" While I hope it will appear there, I felt the need to share this info in my first Amazon review ever. Mainly because I am slightly angry at such a perfect hardware being compromided by a companion app/process that is not consumer- and end user-friendly."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-13,excellent,its a great product and better than the qcii 35 its predecessor. only thing that is rough is the new bose music app which is a pain.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-14,I’ve borrowed the QC35 II and they feel and sound almost identical. If your on a budget go QC35 II.,So far I haven’t had any problems with the headphones. These are my first noise canceling headphones so it’s hard to compare to others but I have thoroughly enjoyed them . Headphones are very comfortable and great at canceling noise.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-07-15,WORTHWHILE UPGRADE IF YOU’RE COMING FROM THE QC35’s (Maybe not the QC35 II’s?),"So I have to disagree with the other reviewer that mentioned something about a mandatory app in order to use the headphones since I was immediately able to pair them with my Fire TV Stick 4K and use all the basic functions sans ‘voice assistant’ button. Everything else worked as it should including volume and the left ear button went from full NC to half to off and the long press went to “listen mode” and paused my show I happened to be watching. However, it’s true that you need the app to update firmware and assign the voice assistant (Siri was the default but most likely cause I have an iPhone XS Max). Anyway, I will say that I’ve had/used them for one day so far so my review is more of an “initial impression” and I’ll update it down the road with more use. That said my initial impressions are they are a worthwhile investment if you own the original QC35’s in that they offer a lot more in the way of creature features. Pros:
- Active NC is impressive! - Voice Assistant is AWESOME (I’m using Google Assistant but it works great so far). - The have a “conversation button” (not the technical term) on the left ear is worth it’s weight in gold. - Although not rated for any moisture protection the headband material seems like it’ll hold up better in a gym type situation. - FINALLY AMAZING CALL QUALITY!!!! - Sound Quality is on par with the QC35’s so I’m suppose that’s a “pro” in my book. Cons:
- Initially not a fan of the “clamp” style but I seemed to get used to it as the day went on but I have a smaller head. - Price! - Didn’t come with a USB adapter....Really Bose? Unknowns:
- Battery Life
- Bose AR...? - Not sure how I feel about the capacitive touch pad for volume control yet. Final Thoughts:
If own the original QC35’s and have always wished you could use them to make calls without everyone on the line being able to hear your in a coffee shop and have always desired the QC35 II’s voice assistant feature then I would at this point recommend pulling the trigger on these bad boys!"
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-07-15,No Power Off Button!,There is no way to turn off these headphones! A Bose rep emailed me to press the bluetooth button but this does not work. Supposedly they were designed to automatically power off after 10min of non use but that doesn't actually happen. These are a downgrade from the last version.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-07-16,just like the qc35s but better mic. Works great in noisy data center. : unacceptably buggy though,I work in a data center that is very noisy. I was really impressed how well these work not only to cancel noise but also how well people can hear me. I was able to stand in an isle of servers with 3 floor vents pointing cold air at my head and the person i as talking to was able to hear me clearly. . I pre-ordered mine from bose right after preorders started but didnt get them for ~10 days after launch. I wish i ordered them from amazon. I'm not a fan of having an app to setup the headset. I would prefer a windows/linux software option. It has proven to be garbage. edit. 7/31/19 - removed 2 stars - few issue have popped up. They have just crashed a few times. I was listening to music then it locks up and shuts off. They turn back on and garbled boot. the pause button shouldnt be 2 sec hold . it should be a tap by default. you shouldn't need an app to control them. why is there no window program? lazy. Another problem is when i unpause it resume the music but has windows still at mute which mean i have to go to the pc to unpause everytime making the button useless. They clearly have big problems with software integration They clearly need a firmware update. edit. still incredibly buggy. unacceptable for a product costing this much. Constant disconnects. I'm disappointed. 1star donr buy till they fix. check in a year or so.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-16,Not as good as Sony WH-1000xm3,"I brought both of these (Bose 700 and Sony 1000xm3) on an flight to compare them. I preferred the sound quality and the noise cancelling of the Sony 'phones, and I found the Sony's to be more comfortable. I returned the Bose 'phones yesterday (bought directly from Bose, not Amazon). I wanted to like the Bose enough to keep them as I like the sound quality of the 'phones when making phone calls, and I like that they can be paired with 2 devices via Bluetooth, but I couldn't get past the other issues which were more important to me. My opinion is to stick with Sony. If you need more features, hopefully V4 of the Sony's will offer what you desire."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-07-16,Disappointed in call experience,"I was very excited about the hyped call quality experience, but it didn't pan out. When I made calls, the callee could hear all the surrounding noise. I then compared them to my Jabra elite e85, and the callee said they couldn't hear any surrounding noise, just me. The jabra had a much better call experience. These Bose are comfortable, the noise canceling is good, and the sound quality is good. But I returned them because of the call experience."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-16,Love my new bose 700 headphones!,"1) Opinions are like a$$hole$, everyone has one. 2) Most of these bad reviews are based on technical issues that I have never had."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-17,touch control not working,"Thought I would go upmarket and splurge on new Bose 700. No detailed instructions included but fairly easy to pair. Sound quality is great. Can not get the touch control to either pause, forward, or reverse. Spent an hour working on this using multiple devices. Next up was product support page. That was a waste of time. Finally, called customer support. The first step in fixing the problem was to have me create a customer profile. Next up was declining the option to get new product info. Then I got to articulate the issue. Put on hold a few minutes and then was asked to reboot my phone. Of course, I am speaking on the phone and the headphones are paired to my MacAir so this request was useless. We moved on to downloading new software update (for a product that is only 30 days in the market). I have to now plug my headphones into my laptop. Of course, USB that comes with the 700 is useless for MacAir. 20 minutes into this train wreck and decided to return the item. Oh, what might have been! Bad karma now! !"
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-18,Not really impressed...,"Big Bose fan so even though I have the QC35II and the Sony 1000XM3, I decided to get the NC700 just thinking that I should try the latest and best from Bose. From my limited usage over a few days, the only improvement I find is the quality of calls taken with the 700. I was on a busy road while taking a work call and I can hear myself the other party very clearly. Other than that, I personally couldn’t detect any difference between the Sony’s and QCII in terms of music quality or noise cancellation. I’m giving it 2 stars because the app just doesn’t work. In fact, on the Bose forum, it is mentioned that there is an issue with the App - this shouldn’t happen with such an expensive headphone."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-18,"Great ANC, Bad Battery Life, Limited Performing Voice Calling","I've owned the Bose QC35 ii for three years now and I can say they are the BEST ANC headphones and have the BEST USER EXPERIENCE, not so good on voice pick up during calls in noisy environments. I'm in the consumer device tech industry and travel for business often, and have been looking in the market for headphones that have good ANC and also have good voice pick up for calls. I was ecstatic when Bose came out with the NC700, having both ANC + voice pick up. As expected, they have great ANC and great listening quality, just as good, if not better, as the QC35s. Beyond that, my experience starts to drop. I did my first conference call with the NC700 in the car on the freeway going to airport, and the voice pick up FAILED. The experience started out great, my colleagues would hear me clearly with no issue, with reduce noise background and clear voice quality. It seemed the NC700 was doing well with the voice pick up. Then all of sudden, intermittently, my voice volume would reduce during the call to the point my colleagues could not hear me or any of the background noise. I can see my input voice volume level monitor from my app and it would notice it reduce to zero. Then after 20-30 seconds later, my voice would pick back up again and my colleagues can hear me loud and clear. This happened a few times during the conference call to the point that I just stopped using the head-set and started using my phone's microphone. Very embarrassing when your coworkers are saying, ""we can't hear you!"" and you've been talking for the last few minutes. Since then, I've tested the NC700's voice pick up quality in different environments, with different apps, PC vs Phone, and results are mixed but more on the failing side. The voice pick up failure happens on any device, with any app. Sometimes it works, most cases it doesn't. Sometimes I can go through a 30 minutes conference call at the airport with no voice pick up issues. Then most times in descent noisy areas, it would just fail within minutes, and I would have to revert to my phone. In a quite room or area, works great! In addition to the voice pick up fail, the battery life sucks! After a full charge, it would say 18 hours of usage available. Within 2-3 hours of continuous use, it would say 10 hours of usage available. What happened to the 8 hours? Just recently, on a full charge, the headset lasted only 10 hours. My journey was business trip, 2 hours on the road, 6 hours on a plane, 2 hours waiting in lobbies, from leaving my place to getting to my destination. Fully charged when I left, dead on arrival at my destination. Oh yeah, almost forgot, the Bose App also sucks. I always have to reconnect my headset to the app in order for the app to recognize my headset. Also I have to keep logging back in, with user name and password, after I wake up the app. It doesn't like to keep my info or keep my logged in. In addition to the app experience, I always get this RED warning notification my headset isn't connected to WIFI. I'm not sure why I need Wifi to have this operate normally. Very annoying. I do have a wireless unlimited data plan. My wife has the same pair, but her voice pick up seems better. She uses to call me while she's on the bus and she's loud a clear the whole conversation. As for me, it cuts out. I'm returning NC700 and getting a replacement."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-18,"Great Noise Cancellation, No Bass","These headphones work great cancelling noise and providing crisp and clear audio - however they do not produce sufficient bass for anything other than classical music. It’s really quite a disappointment as the clarity on these is amazing, but the lack of bass make them sound lackluster. If they had 50% more bass, these would be killer headphones."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-07-18,Never have I returned something so fast...,"I will say the core features of noise cancellation, sound, and phone call quality is pretty good. I'm ashamed of everything else. The look of these are strange, the headband is tight, they run warm with higher noise cancelling, it's hard to even adjust the earcup placement on your head, etc etc.
So disappointed with the cost. I no longer own these and will stick it out with my QC 35 ii, even invest in replacing the ears on them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-19,The sensational touch of the 700,"The similarities they have with the QQ35 II but the overall listening quality is clearer, the touch function is awesome once utilizing them. I’m still getting familiar"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-19,Noise Cancellation 5 Stars,"After reading some bad reviews I decided to go ahead anyways with my order knowing that some people complain about winning the lottery and having to pay taxes on the millions they won.... Set up was done in under five minutes and it was super easy! the noise cancellation is really good, and they seem to have better base then the QuietComfort 35 II I replaced with these. I’m sure the wife won't realize for a month that I got newer and better ones. the weight seems to be the same as the QuietComfort 35 II but the specs say these weigh a tiny bit more. if you can tell the difference you may need to get a life…. overall I like the 700's and if they turn out to suck after a couple of days or my upcoming flight I’ll update my post and be a dem like some of you. UPDATE: I was mowing the lawn and they worked great until I came close to any wall. The headphones had a crackly sound every time I got within about 4 feet of a wall. I’m guessing they had issues processing the noice bouncing off the wall. My QuietComfort 35 never had that issue."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-19,Overall great improvement on ID!,"Great product design, slim profile and great connectivity and noise canceling. Sound quality is great. The Only setback is touch control panel which is way too sensitive I accidentally hit it and song stopped or skipped unintentionally."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-19,Bluetooth and app problem,"Sound quality and NC are good, the bad thing is Bluetooth connection and app. You will randomly get disconnected and even if your phone is connected you won’t get any sound without app that is not recognizing your headphones. After one day I’m returning them."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-07-19,Bose have Put me down!,"I Paid $400 + Tax = $435
Really wanting to switch it from my Sony 1000XM3 but this is not happening, Paying Premium price and getting the same QC feel even though they said its totally a revamp but again this is not true. ANC is still better on my Sony 1000XM3 only and the only thing I would say Bose have better are mics and I don't care about that at all. Biggest thing battery life Bose have it 20 hours also bose's quick charge need 15 mins atleast VS Sony 1000XM3 in 5 mins I am good to go with 4 hours huge diff I am sure these are small thing but for me it is big when I am paying money I need things to be perfect which is not happening these headphones are going back also I am not able to change Base, voice etc the way I want to this is not nice Bose, this is my headphone and I want to setup the sound the way I want and like, and their Bose headphone app have lot of issue + why do I have to register it ? I don't want to register take your headphones back there are so many issue I can list here I would still take QC35 as a 2nd preference but these NC700 really no go and I will never recommend these to any one."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-19,Sharp learning curve!,"Man, did I want to like these. I’ve been a Bose-aholic since I was a sophomore at BU and bought a brand-new pair of 901s, which I still love. The NC 700s just haven’t got the same chops. I think had Bose stuck with straight up sound reproduction, they’d rule the world. It’s the tech gadgetry where things go bad. Listening to music with these things, whether Herbert von Karajan, or Dwight Yoakam, takes the listener to a remote soundstage where all is right with the world. Riding on my tractor, I can now listen to music, the news, podcasts, or books, and everything is good. The sound quality is actually very rich and I experienced none of the bass dropout reported by others. At full volume, however, the speakers are overloaded, and there is a fair amount of clipping. To be fair, the speakers are not what I’d expect to handle Toccata and Fugue in D minor at volume. As for noise canceling, I’d say there would be a closer relationship to actuality were they called noise-reducing. The problems I experience are a) the phones power off randomly, b) they drop the Bluetooth connection frequently (The iPhone is in my pocket, not beyond range), c) they go into a garbling mode wherein my speech is indecipherable to my listener, or vice versa, and the call must be terminated and the phones reset to correct. The application is confounding. On opening the app, there is a red banner across the top of the screen stating “Your phone isn’t connected to a Wifi network.” This is displayed directly beneath the area on the phone display where it shows “Wi-Fi” and three full bars. The app seems also to be installing an update nearly every time I open it. I’ve noticed this 4 or 5 times since the phones arrived. Agreed, the app is frustrating, and having to register an account with Bose to use it is annoying, but as it's so bad the good news is that once you're done setting up the phones you can just delete it and use your regular phone apps and features. I did get an update on the Phones by using the usb cable and the Bose updater. I like to talk on the phone. My conversations can be lengthy. I was hoping to be able to enjoy hand-free noise reduced conversations with the Bose NC 700 headphones. With the dropped connections and powering down randomly (“auto power off” is set to “never”), this is not possible. as for 20 hour battery life - after sitting overnight on charge, the highest I get is 19 hours. How long they will actually last remains to be seen. I will wait until the latest instant to return them, in hopes a software update will come through addressing these issues. Fingers crossed. edit: After several weeks now with the NC700s, I've learned that a) there's no point in calling Bose customer service for anything, b) The Bose Music app should just be ignored, and c) after recovering from some initial shock reaction to these phones, they grow on you. The controls are a little tricky, and sometimes I still have to look up how to do something, but the phones themselves do a really great job at noise cancellation while providing a very high fidelity in music reproduction. After my purchase, there was an update to the iphone app as well as an update to the phones themselves. Since then the bass response improved noticably making the overall sound quality really nice. The updated app, at least on IOS, remains worthless. There are places in the app to enter userid and p/w for pandora and other streaming services, as well as Bose's, but once that's done, there is no was to access the service through the app. I have installed and deleted the app several times to see if there's any effect on performane, and if there is, I can't find it. I use iTunes, and just select a lengthy playlist. After that, using controls on the phones, I go about my tasks. Whether streaming through an app or listening from my library, talking on the phone, or listening to a show from my AppleTV, I have found nothing to mandate the use of the Bose Music app beyond the initial setup of the product. And, as the app it the only shortcoming in the experience, once it's removed from the equation, there is nothing remainig for which to ding these phones, allowing me to up my rating from 3 to 5 stars. Just ditch the app!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-20,BLOWN away!!,"I sold my Bose QC35's on eBay to make way for these headphones. I can't tell you how fantastic the sound quality is from these--I never want to take them off, to the chagrin of my wife :-(. I've always used my QC 35's exclusively for airline travel but will now also use them for walking and exercising. Well done, Bose. Bravo! !"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-20,Great noise canceling,Great improvement over the qc35 I wish battery live was longer but sound quality and noise canceling is much better then the qc35 or the Sony 3
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-20,Not as comfortable or as stable as the QC35 i or QC35 ii,"One of my favorite purchases, and best investments, ever was the QC35 (1st generation). For three years I have worn them daily to the gym, public transportation and on medium (3-6 mile) runs. I sweat a lot more than the average person and the old headphones never seemed to mind. The sound was amazing to my ears and they were oh so, comfortable because of the thick ear cushions, wrapped headband and lightweight. My expectations then, for the QC700 were out the roof. However, and sadly, I have to tell you that these headphones were prematurely rushed to the market and are in bad need of an update before they will be worth more than half of their retail price. The QC700 are slightly heavier, tighter fitting, more difficult to adjust-- arguably, they took a step back with aesthetics-- and the sound quality is worse in two ways. First. and most importantly, the audio usese a technology that reduces the base at higher volumes. So to get the best sound, you really have to tweak the volume to a setting that might not be right for you. Secondly, Bose has scrapped plans for an update with an equalizer, meaning you cannot fine tune the Bose signature sound. The reasoning is because if you tweak the lows, then it will be offset by the technology which changes as the volume changes. Fail. I did purchase the QC 700 and I returned them after a week of using them. I could not wait to get my QC 35 back on. In order to use those longer, I just buy Oxiclean to keep the ear cushions fresh. On a separate note, be careful when buying replacement cushions for the QC35. I also bought a pair of those from 3 different vendors including Bose. They are 54.5mm in circumference, whereas the original are 64mm. The small size compromises the seal. I'll stick with Oxiclean until mine fall to shreds. I will also be checking out the MDX series 3 and JBL Live while waiting for an update from Bose."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-21,Sleek and comfortable,Perfect headset - super comfortable - been wearing these all day at work - no real big connection issues like other people.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-22,Great design!,Great improvements. The auto power off take a little getting used to.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-22,The best noise cancelling headphones for the office.,"I find them great for office work. I pair them to my MacBook and Pixel 3a. I have no issues going between them. The noise-canceling works great and I can't hear moat of the noise going on around me. I got these over the Sony's XM whatevers because the Sony's have a busted microphone that will probably never improve. I had no issues installing the Bose Music application and configuring my headphones for use. I was using them within a couple minutes. Calls are no problem and I have yet to have someone complain about the microphone. The case they come with is really nice and they charge up quickly with USB C.
If you want a good pair of noise-canceling headphones for office work this pair is a home run. They are a bit pricey, but honestly I haven't felt any buyers remorse and I see other people around the office using them now so they must be catching on a bit."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-22,I don't recommend this,"I usually don't write bad comments because maybe it's a personal experience, but this headphone went too far. I've bought 20+ headphones before. This is not the one I'll see myself using. Connecting this headphone to PC is mad. It takes ages to connect and when it does, if you turn up the volume, the music starts cutting off. Also, some users will take up to 30 minutes to connect via phone. The sound quality is not good compared to other cheaper models. The design and noise-canceling are good though. I won't recommend them even for my worst enemy."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-22,WOW! These put me in my own little world...❤️,"I am not a headphone Aficionado by any means, but I know what I like and I just don’t like these...I LOVE them. I have about three pairs of headphones, two noise cancelling, and they don’t even come close. Of course the price point is different with these being on the high end, but from what I’ve discovered...it’s worth it! The sounds and tones are so clear and beautiful and you hear every nuance. Sometimes even surprising, with familiar music I thought I knew well. And, I AM FINALLY FINDING SOME PEACE...in my everyday life. I can put these amazing headphones on, set noise reduction at Level 10, and I don’t have to listen to high maintenance barking dogs or my Hubby’s ear shattering television level since he won’t admit he has a hearing problem. I’m in my own little world, and I’ve actually warned them all that I’m not listening to their nonsense anymore! Hehe. I’m actually feeling a little guilty at times as these work so well, I think I’m blocking out things I might need to hear. Oh well. I was a bit perturbed at first that I had to download the Bose Music app in order for these to work, and I had a heck of a time trying to pair them with my iPad. They paired fine though after I unplugged them??? The Bose App is actually quite good and connects you to a tour of the operation of these headphones, as the manual that comes with them doesn’t give much info. You can also add your own music sources, listen to some stations they provide and it keeps a tally of your remaining battery life, and I’m sure much more. These are nothing like my other headphones, and I was looking for buttons, etc., for volume, advancing, etc.. what’s cool is, you control volume and song selection with a light swipe of the earphone. It’s awesome! The range is totally amazing. We have a fairly large house with a lot of walls and I could actually walk about 60ft away from my music source without any break up of signal, and even then it would regain quickly. They’re adjustable for size and I wore them for an entire baseball game tonight on AtBat and had no discomfort whatsoever. Nicely padded earphones and a nifty carrying case. I sincerely couldn’t ask for anything more and feel extremely privileged to be able to receive and review such an excellent product. ❤️❤️❤️"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-22,Potentially unreliable for flights without internet,"The sound quality is decent for the money. The $400 price point gets you first rate active noise cancellation which meets expectations. The comfort is pretty good, especially considering nicer construction materials (mostly aluminum finishing). I am also not a fan of the lack of EQ. I prefer a flat sound response, while Bose has a one-size-fits-all EQ set within the firmware. I understand that the listening environment for a headphone like this is very well standardized, but I believe Bose mastered the sound intending to make it sound “better” to the masses, while recording artists may have intended something different. A big GOTCHA, is that you must create and log into a Bose web account to configure the headphones. If you are logged out of the app and find yourself without internet, you will be married to the settings as they were last configured (i.e., voice prompt on/off, 3 favorite noise cancellation settings as toggled by action button). I subtract a single star for each issue:
-lack of EQ setting
-offline configuration is intentionally crippled"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-22,Great noise cancellation for sound and calls,Great noise cancellation compared to the QC35. The QC35s were good but these blow them away. The sound is great.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-22,Incredible Sound,"These headphones are awesome. They were easy to connect right out of the box. I already had Bose Sound on my phone, so the connection was immediate through Blue Tooth. My wife hooked it up to her Kindle, and that also worked stupendously. It has good range throughout the house while doing chores, etc. The ear phones are comfortable and not too tight. My wife and I have both used them and they are comfortable for both of us. The controls are simple and there is a wide range of volume . I believe the noise cancelling will be very effective, too. I have not flown since getting them, but experimenting around the house promises for better use than some earphones I have tried in the past on planes. They are not cheap, but they are very good."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-07-22,Returned after 3 days.,"Let me start by highlighting the 2 good things about these: 1) Sound Quality is Terrific. 2) Very comfortable to wear. Now the bad and the deal breaker. Obviously I did not pay close attention to some of the reviews before buying these. But I'll be Damned if I HAVE to be forced to use the Bose App (which is Horrible) in order to use these things. Let me just plug them in or connect thru Wi-Fi and be done with it. Instead, I am OBLIGATED to create a Bose account in order to use these. Why in the world should have have to hassle with ""logging in"" in order to use headphones that cost me $400. I just won't stand for risking my privacy which I have to do to use these things and deal with an app. that is notoriously flawed and results in hiccups. This could have been a 5 star product but, in my opinion, Bose really screwed it up by imposing all these needless steps required to effectively use them."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-23,Great sound quality - TERRIBLE usability,"Great sound quality, great noise cancellation, finally bose try to catch up with the new technologies (ambiance amplification and touch)! On the Flip side:
1 - Heavy and get uncomfortable if you wear them for a long time. The top of the head hurts
They fall-off my head a lot. Can’t use them in the gym, can lean your head back! 2- They fall off your head!!! I cant use them at the gym, I cant lay down on the plane, I cant tilt my head... WHAT ARE THEY MADE FOR THEN? 3 - VERY user-unfriendly!!!! I never turn them off correctly!!! They never turn off or on when I need them! 4 - Surprised you cant edit music themes or equalize it
5 - Pairing them is a hassle! 6 - They are not easy to carry around! My sennheisers and Sonys are folded and get fit into my bag, these ones are way too inconvenient to carry around. I would say this is an overall fail for BOSE."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-23,By far the best,"Sony WH1000XM3 is regarded best now, but my credit goes to Bose. I just sold off my Sony. 1) Sony supports Hi Res and LDAC. But compared to Beyerdynamics, the high fidelty sound cannot be experienced in Sony. 2) Sony has too much bass. Bose was just right. 3) Bose metal actually feels nice to grasp as opposed to plastic. 4) Connects to dual bluetooth at once. 5) Fits on my ear perfect. To everyone, be cautious of reviews on comfort. Sony was always pressing my ear. Bose QC35 and 700 didnt press my ears. 6) Noise cancelling is superb and no ringing noise from Bose. No airplane jack. What the f***"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-24,Where is the love?,"First, I never write reviews. Second, I agonized over an ANC headphone purchase for months. I'm kind of picky with electronics, and I often change my mind about what's important. Anyway, I hesitated to buy this particular item due to the percentage of negative reviews it was receiving. I understand it's a newer product, and the review sample size is still small, but I was concerned. Four hundred dollars is a fair chunk of coin, and I wanted something I was not going to regret buying. I do not regret my purchase at all. I listened to as many pairs of headphones I could find. The NC700's are not the best sounding pair I listened to,but they do sound very good. I am not going to grow weary of Bose's sound signature anytime soon. They do not sound like the B & W's or the Bang and Olufsen's, but they do not suck. I mostly listen to music that is being streamed and/or compressed anyway. After that, they are far and away the most comfortable headphones I have ever had on my head. I a big guy with a fat head, and they feel awesome for extended periods. They are also an exceptional choice if you wear glasses. That wound up being a fairly important issue, because I tend to work long hours while wearing glasses. The Noise Cancelling is as good as it gets. There is not much else you can say about it. An added bonus for me was the best call quality of any headset I have ever used. So yeah, buy them. They are expensive, but they are a remarkable piece of form and function."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-24,Well-balanced Noise Canceling Headphone for outdoor,"I have Sony 1000X, Bowers and Wilkins PX, Dolby Dimensions, and bought this Bose NC700. Bose is the most comfortable headphone for me. And noise canceling ability is one-step ahead of others. Sounds good, but I should admit that bass is somewhat flattened. It makes plain sound over all range. But new design is simple and elegant. In addition, voice pickup capability is unbeatable. I have no choice but buy Bose NC700. Bowers and Wilkins has well balanced sound with a little lack of NC capability. And slightly heavy. It makes me uncomfortable for prolonged use. Dolby looks great and virtualization is superb. But NC capability and running-time are below my expectation. It is designed for indoor use only. Sony, as you already knew, is one of the greatest NC headphones in the world. Looks great and sounds great, also. The only problem is voice pickup."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-24,I REALLY Wanted to Like These Headphones,"This was my first pair of ANC headphones. After years of interest, the features of the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 tipped the scales and I took the plunge. What I was excited about the most was the microphone noise cancelling while making calls. Working in an open office space, this feature alone would make my life so much easier. So, despite the bevy of negative reviews, I hoped for the best. The initial iOS app setup was simple and seemed to work just fine. I connected the headphones to my iPhone and computer with ease. Soon I was taking calls on my phone and listening to music from the computer curtesy of the multiple device capabilities. But then the app indicated I needed to update the headphones, and nothing has been the same since. The first problem was the iOS app. When I tried to connect to change the settings, I would receive a red error stating the app could not connect. I no longer had access to the setting and was stuck listening to the voice prompts anytime a button was pressed. After calling tech support, they told me this was a known issue and were working on the problem. So, I decided to grin and bare the problem until the next app version. In the meantime, I started testing some of the other features, especially the microphone noise canceling. This is where I started to feel I’d made a mistake in my purchase. Basically, it was a “tale of two cities” when it came to audio call quality. While the call quality made from my iPhone sounded very good, when I tried to use the headphones to make a call from a computer soft phone, the quality sounded no better than two tin cans and string. And while that might sound like hyperbole, it was really that bad. I tried the softphone app on my iPhone, and it was not much better. So my conclusion is that the audio call quality was only useful when making calls from my phone and not any other platform or app.
Other quirks that happened while I was waiting for the next app version included random power cycles, buttons inexplicably not working any more, and choppy audio while playing music from my computer even though I was 2 feet away. The slow trickle of issues continued to push me toward the conclusion of returning the product, but I held out for the hope that the new app would fix all the issues and I would be a happy Bose fanatic. The app did finally come out and initially I could finally connect to the headphone settings and make the changes I have been wanting to make. But there were clearly still issues. First, even though I was connected to two Bluetooth devices, neither one would play sound while the other was connected. I had to go into the headphone setting and toggle off one device before the second device would play back sound. Also, the audio call quality was still an issue when using it from a softphone on my computer. Finally, a couple days later, when I tried to go into the headphone setting from the iOS app, I was asked to setup the headphones even though they already had an active Bluetooth connection. I played along with the prompts, but it would always end with the same problem I had from the beginning, “Cannot Connect, Please Try Again Later.”
After one last attempt to contact technical support (which on a side note, I could never get routed to the correct department on the first try and my call was dropped during one of the transfers) I was told the only solution was to send me out a replacement set of headphones. So, one of the most advanced and admired audio companies in the world, who has had years to refine their ANC technologies to the point of category dominance could not release a new product without so many issues that the only solution was to replace a brand new set of headphones? It was not like these were nearing the end of the warranty period; these were less than two weeks old. Unfortunately, the writing was on the wall and there was no way I was going to miss the return window. Despite all the issues, I really did want to like these headphones, but it seems the rush to market has left too many bugs in the product to warrant hoping they would get fixed in the future. I will wait either for the product to get fixed and then repurchase them or see if any other options exist that might rekindle my interest."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-25,A downgrade from the QC35 IIs,"I've owned a lot of headphones and the QC 35s are some of my favorite I've ever owned. The 700s at full noise cancellation (10) have difficulty even drowning out most of the air conditioner from several rooms away. My QC35s are significantly better at drowning out white noise, which is a really important feature if you use these on an airplane (a common use case). They are noticeably less comfortable, something Bose has always been great at. My ears touch the inside of the cups, and I can clearly feel the pressure on both the top and sides of my head. Unlike other reviews say, the app is not necessary to use this product, but I would have much rather had a less intrusive app experience to unlock all of the features. Sound quality seems on par with other Bose products. I'm relatively pleased there, as someone who values clean sound without needless smile curving. For the price you are better off getting something else. I can't recommend this product."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-07-26,Bose lover continues to love...gotta work on their firmware and software approach,"Bose has serious issues with its software and firmware approach, but when you use the headphones without their iOS application, they are amazing. I’m on the phone for work 20-30 hours a week and I’ve had people state that my voice is even clearer vs. my QC35s. There is no doubt that if you use this to do work, these are the best headphones on the market. I’ve so fallen out of love with Sony, I have to admit I would never go back. I know they are highly rated, but I am committed to Bose. I love the the company. I would rate these a 5 if Bose addressed their software and firmware issues before releasing headphones. I had the same problem with my old QC-35s. I don’t get it...three hours of use and I identified all the bugs so don’t understand why they release headphones without remediating these issues proactively. Where is there QA department? That said, they always resolve the issues after a few months."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-07-26,Too tight,"Tried these on in the store. If you wear a size 7 1/2 or larger hat, these may be too tight for you to wear more than a few minutes. After 5 minutes the sides of my head started to hurt. If your head is sensitive to pressure or you have a larger head, try these on before purchasing them."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-26,Bluetooth frequently disconnects and app doesn't work consistently,"Extremely disappointed in these. I have Bose speakers and these are my third Bose headphones and have been extremely satisfied with Bose products in the past. But based on the issues I've had with the NC700s, I'm returning these and going with Sony. I was on a 10 hour flight and the headphones must have disconnected from my phone at least 10 times. I was hoping there would be a firmware update but still nothing. The app is hit or miss. I open the app to change settings on the headphones and majority of the time it can't connect to the headphones. With so many of Bose's products being a hit in my book I'm not sure how these could be such a miss."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-07-26,"Hardware is great, but software app is very buggy","Excellent noise cancellation, attractive looking design, and a good response to the big challenge from the Sony MX headphones. Noise cancellation is the best I've heard, but not so superior that it would be the only reason to replace another good headphone with ANC. Audio quality is better than Sony- less bass, and more neutral - it's pretty good. But the frustrations have been the set up and software you need to use all of the features of the headphones. It has failed on many levels, particularly disconnecting and a number of error messages such as telling me to turn WiFi on when it is on. If you open the app while already connected to an iPhone, it wants you to connect again to access its features. The Bose customer support is some of the worst I've encountered. Truly ignorant of any of the issues people are reporting. To add insult to injury, when I requested a return, I was told I was not eligible, as I pre-ordered it more than a month earlier. They tried to explain how preordering begins the clock for returns. Shameful for a well-respected company to have such poor support. Tried using their website for help and it also is poor. Takes you to dead links and makes it difficult to access the reviews and search the site. Asks you to sign on and it takes you to a dead page. Bottom line is while Bose may have first-world hardware engineers, it has third-world software and support. As a design engineer, if I worked so hard on the hardware, I'd be very upset that the rest of the team failed to do their job and made the product much more difficult to use."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-27,Worth every penny,"The active noise cancellation is neat, changing the level of cancellation is kind of cool, but honestly I don't know why you would want it anything other than off or all the way on. With noise cancellation and a little music I couldn't hear anything while flying, and it makes working in a cubicle much more peaceful. They are comfortable, but don't breathe well so your ears get hot, but that is necessary to block out noise and shouldn't be a problem while inside."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-27,Moving in the right direction,"What I love :
1) One of the best mics in a headphone. 2) It also has the same top quality noise cancelation (as good as qc35 ii if not better) . 3) Love its multi devices connect and its smooth transfer from laptop to phone and vice versa. 4) USB type C with pretty fast charging. To improve:
1) The user should be able to disable the gestures while listening to music to avoid any unintentional swipes. 2) Battery life can be more. It supports about 20 hours now. Sony's old headphone have about 30 hours. 3) more control on the quality of sound (eg bass)
P.S review from an Android user."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-07-27,"Great NC and wireless, a few gripes","I received these a few weeks ago and feel an appropriate amount of time, activities, and use of the 700s has been had for a review. The build quality is very nice. I typically use these everyday for long periods of time and they are sturdy with no signs of wear. They are comfortable enough when worn appropriately. I have a habit of uncupping one ear instead of turning NC to 0 which can lead to discomfort around the ears and top of the head. This is no fault of the product however. The buttons and controls work well with iOS, Siri, and Alexa in my experience. Playback controls on PC do not always work as seamlessly, with skip often not working in some applications. Noise cancellation is as good as it gets. Not much to expound upon, if this is the most important feature for you, fret not. In addition to great NC, the call quality is worth mentioning because it may be the 700's most outstanding feature. I've had calls with distraction level noise disturbances in my vicinity and clarity is just as good, if not better, than my iPhone's default mic. You can also tune how much of your voice comes through to your ears to make conversation feel more natural. I'll use this feature to segue into the Bluetooth functionality, the Bose music app, and use on a non-mobile device. Connecting to two devices at once works surprisingly well. It's very easy to get audio from the source I want with a simple pause x, play y. Range in my house is almost unbelievable, I haven't tested it's limits but clear across my house through the drywall I'm still connected. The Bose music app for iOS is atrocious. When it works it's great, but on a consistent and frequent basis I have to kill the app and restart to avoid a totally pointless login screen. If that isn't the issue, the app often doesn't acknowledge that the phone is paired with the headphones despite them actively streaming audio from the device. This has caused me to re-pair the headphones with the app on occasion which is annoying. Even when working properly the app is sluggish and seems unresponsive. You can customize how long the headphones remain on when no audio is transmitted to the headphones in addition to a lack of motion (though they have still shut off on me despite motion). Bose claims a battery life of 20 hours, my app consistently reports 17.5 hours on a full charge. If you charge it at night or once a day, it's really not an issue even with all-day use. Sound quality is perfectly fine for the average user. If you're looking for studio level audio clarity, I'm not sure why you are reading this review. These are wireless NC headphones, and the sound quality great for that purpose. They don't get as loud as normal headphones, which is kind-of the point of NC. Bass can feel muted if you're used to heavy bass, but bass heavy music sounds fine to me and is probably a more subjective issue. Overall, if you want top quality NC headphones and have the $400 to shell out, go for it. If you're upgrading from other NC headphones it may not be worth the money, maybe test them out at a Bose store or wherever they are sold retail. The app functionality really needs to be addressed so maybe wait to see if Bose can ameliorate the problems if you already have headphones. If making and receiving calls is your main use case these are a safe purchase. I will update if anything changes."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-07-28,Not bad *updated*,"*updated after using for awhile*
The pressure sound previously mentioned is something you easily get used to. It blocks out engine noise and annoying background sound wonderfully. They’re still very comfortable. Only other ‘con’ is the little compartment inside the case, that holds the wires, is held with magnets, but doesn’t stay shut. I like the much more than my initial impression. So i really expected to love these, but I’m on the fence. They are more comfortable than my Bose soundlink, the head piece is superior with cushioning support. The noise canceling feature is average. Even at a 10 it doesn’t block out my kids. When i have them at a 10 i feel the pressure in my ears and it bugs me. The sound quality is nice and i like the touch/slide features on the ear piece. The tutorial in the app is simple and helpful. Tho, I have a hard time spending $400 on something that is just ‘ok’, i definitely was not wowed. Also, i accidentally held down the Bluetooth/power button and it ‘removed’ the device. It was still visible as a device from my phone, but refused to connect. I had to forget the device and start from scratch to get it to recognize it again. Slightly frustrating. I’d stick to my soundlinks for half the price."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-07-28,"Beware not about product, about the company",I own a pair of QC35ii from Bose. With the latest update -just before 700 series arrived BOSE ruined the Active Noise Cancellation. if you want to use you earphone beware when e never model comes your ANC will be destroyed by a firmware upgrade. Similar thing happened with qc35 first version as well. just google firmware 3.0.3 and firmware 4.5.2 you will understand. Shame on you BOSE
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-28,Bluetooth is okay + carry case is low quality,These headphones are great but I would not buy again. I am disappointed that the expectations I have for Bose could not be met with this product. I use my old qc15 carry case for these because it is better quality. The headphones work well except I cannot connect using the Bose apps to change any of the settings. This is a common issue I hear.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-28,Meh headphones,Not as great as the qc35s. These headphones are not the successor we have been waiting for... I had a really hard time getting the headphones to connect to the Bose app. They only connected at first pairing. Subsequent pairings would be detected by Bose app. They also easily slip forward in my head when I bend over to get things.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-07-29,Wonderful product with a great future!,"Evolution starts with innovation! I just started to spend time with the Bose 700 Noise Cancellation headphones. It’s a different device in style and function from the Quietcomfort series. The buttons set up is different. The way the headphones are adjusted on the head is a very big difference. If a person has a collection of Quietcomfort products like myself, it will be a new learning experience. Once I learned to adjust my headphones for fitting on the earcup (sliding it up or down), I could reach a comfortable fit. I’m seeing that others are not picking this up the same way. The adjustment is on the earcup rather than the headband. The headphones are very comfortable! Learning the new functionality such as the volume controls swipe and switching tracks as well as making a call required me to read the manual. Once I learned these new controls, I could engage conversation mode have a good experience on a call. Calls sound better on this device and Bluetooth 5 is more in line with the IPhone XR model. The volume control on the right earcup is wonderful as well as changing tracks. The swipes work well. Using Siri and other assistants is fun and helpful. This is the most functional product I’ve used. I’d like to talk about the sound. The Quietcomfort series always offered the signature Bose sound with a great EQ that BOSE offers. I really like this EQ and I’m excited about the possibility of adjustment with the new software coming out for the 700. I am also excited about the Noise Masking, which the Bose Sleepbuds do very well. The sound that comes with the 700 is a step above the previous products and I noticed this immediately. The adjustable noise cancelling is great and is even more functional than the QC30 because the numbers help me guide better how much noise reduction I need. It is awesome to have the selectability like the QC30! The NC is also improved on the 700 and I really like it because it makes the sound better. I really love the sound in this unit and I know that others will too. I was happy with the call quality on this unit and think that the additional microphones help. The sound of the caller on the other side is significantly improved and I’m more likely to make calls on this device. The Bose Music App is a great app once I took time to get to know it. I think it will offer even more than the Bose Connect App in the future and I love the Bose Connect App, especially since I can listen to news! I love the picture of the headphones and the noise cancelling numbers. Connecting to the app will take a little time after ensuring that the headphones are updated on a computer using the Bose updater and then checking the Bluetooth the properly sync with the app. Once the unit is paired to the app and paired to the AR apps, there is a lot fun to be had. Lets talk about augmented reality by BOSE. This is my most favorite part of the evolution! One thing I noticed is that the AR works very well on the 700 model, with apps like Earplay. AR is constantly evolving and improving and the apps acknowledge this device better than ever before. I love Navisens and it helps me get around New York CIty , especially Hudson Yards. It differentiates BOSE from the others. I started using navigation with the BOSE Rondo and Alto and I loved it. The key here is leaving the phone in the pocket and learning to trust the AR. The bottom line is with any new device, one has to have patience and an open mind. I have read others experiences and they haven’t truly tapped into what can be done here. The other competitors cannot offer an experience quite like this one. There is so much that the 700 will offer and we’ve only started with the tip of the iceberg here. Looking at the Pear app, I am looking forward to working out with the Bose in ear products when they arrive. The 700 has piqued my interest a lot and I can’t wait to see what it can do in the future. It’s a fun product to use and it represents the best of BOSE personal listening."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-07-29,I returned it,Poor sound quality for the cost
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-07-29,"Good Product, Not better than QC 35 II","I really wanted to like this product. I have upgraded from older wired NC Bose to QC 35 II last year, but want MORE NC sound barrier. I travel A LOT, usually red eye and want complete sound barrier while listening to relaxing sounds/music. The original NC are very good, the bluetooth improvement was great, but the concept of dialing up/down the NC feature was exactly what i wanted. However, the NC feature on Bose 700, when set to 10 (highest) is same or only slightly quieter than the QC 35 II. The Bose Music App will NOT pair - the bose cust service is terrible - this is priced as premium product but does not deliver premium service. side note - the other reviews sounded 'too good to be true' so i found a service which weeds out fake reviews on amazon - fake spot - that gave this product a very high warning for fake reviews. i wish i had seen this prior to purchase. fortunately, i am well within my 30day return period. I really wanted to like this product. Pros - good sound, good noise cancelling, decent battery life - fully charged 20hrs
Cons - no better than QC 35 II (i.e. not worth upgrade), app won't pair (but HFs do), tricky getting hang of functions (swipe for volume control, change tunes, mute for call) was difficult for receiving calls (""...can you hear me now..."") bose cust svc is terrible (nice people, but not knowledgeable) case too large, comes with USB ""C"" which is ridiculously short - maybe 12"""
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-29,"Amazing sound quality, amazing mic and amazing noise cancellation","I am really happy with this one of a kind product :)
Me as a mum had a very good test for noise cancellation :D I tried to put it on while my kid was screaming to see how much of the surrounded noise will be cancelled and I literally heard nothing except the song that I was playing! That was awesome!!! It is connected with the mobile app easily and it's touch controls work perfectly."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-30,"Best not only for music lovers, but also for on-road professional; and excellent assistant too!","The distinguishing attribute of the Bose 700 is the crystal clear call quality, not only for you, but also for the person on the other side of the call. I have tried other noise-cancelling headphones, but the one thing those were not good at was call quality - noise from traffic, crowds, and the blowing wind (the worst offender) interfered and made using those headphones for calls unbearable. with Bose 700, I have made calls from crowded Times Square, windy Central Park, and noisy Sixth Avenue - the people on the other side did not have any problems hearing me, and I felt like I was in an shut-door office. The other excellent feature is the notifications (I use Google Assistant) that allows one, at a click of the button, to listen to notifications, texts, messages, and email headers. One can also use the assistant to reply to messages and texts. Cons: Price; wish it were similarly priced to the QC 35IIs or the Sony 1000s. But I do not regret spending the $400!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-30,Noise Cancelling and Performance on Phone Calls is Astounding,"I have had every generation of noise cancelling headphones from bose, often multiple sets. This pair really wins for noise cancellation, sound quality, and use for phone calls / video calls. The noise cancelling is significantly better than my QC35 and my older pairs as well. Very noticeable improvement. I have a large head, and I am bald, so I worry about fit comfort a lot, but these are super comfortable to wear fro long periods of time. Highly recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade their current noise cancelling headset. Setup on iphone was a bit clunky, so follow the directions, get them updated, but after that, smooth sailing."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-30,"Best Headphones out there for Office, Commute and Travel","Coming form the QC 35 I's, I was expecting to try these out for a week or two and eventually return them because the reviews I had read indicating marginal improvement. That may be the case for the sound quality, but the noise cancellation is noticeably better. I use these primarily in an office setting and it blocks out all unwanted noise, whereas before there would be some nearby conversations that got through. For when somebody does come by my desk for a conversation (and they start talking before I'm able to take off my headphones), flipping on conversation mode by holding the button on the left earcup is extremely convenient and works as advertised. I have only fielded one call on these, on a crowded urban street during rush hour, and i could hear the person on the other end perfectly and they could hear me clearly as well. Another major improvement for me was touch controls - I've had zero problems with them and they make flipping through songs, or pausing a lot easier than having to pick up my phone. I will admit the app and connectivity issues are a little funky right now, insofar that if I listen on both my phone and computer, it has a hard time transitioning between to two. The app (Android) constantly does not recognize that I am connected and struggles to reconnect at times. This is the biggest problem with these headphones for me at the moment, but because they are software issues that will likely be improved through update, I'm not terribly concerned about it, because the hardware Bose put out is top-notch. All these major and minor upgrades taken together make it well worth the purchase for me."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-07-31,"Abysmal engineering quality from a company that was, once upon a time, capable of so much more.","Bose designed these headphones to rely on a paired application (Bose Music app, in my case running as an IOS app on an iPhone and an iPad Pro) for much of their functionality. The Music app as delivered is completely nonfunctional, it will not even pair with the headphones. Bose technical service informs me that this is a known defect and that I must wait for an app update (the version available now (7/31/2019) was released on 7/19/2019 as an update that purported to fix these very issues. Bose will not give me any information on how long I’m expected to wait for the next update. Engineering a device that depends on a nonfunctional application to deliver about half of the functionality that presumably justifies the very high price of this product casts doubt on the ability of Bose to patch these defects and deliver what I paid for. Caveat emptor."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-07-31,very comfortable and the microphones are incredible,"I got this headset to be able to talk on the phone in noisy environments and this headset does that and more! Great headset, worth the money."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-07-31,"Horrible software design, and bluetooth pairing ruin what could have been amazing headphones","Sound Quality: Bad, but acceptable since you don't buy bose headphones for stellar sound quality
Noise Cancellation: Superb noise cancellation. Bose does this better than anyone. I've tested in many different environments (planes, coffee shops, home while gardeners are working, etc), and I've yet to come across better noise cancellation
Bluetooth connectivity: Just horrible. I've had random disconnects for starters which is bad, but I could almost get past it since it doesn't happen that often, but the really horrible thing is that it's impossible to connect these headphones to more than one device and seamlessly transition from one device to the other. The only way I've found that works is to completely disable bluetooth on all devices that have paired with the headphones prior to trying to switch to using something else. That means if I'm in my bedroom and would like to use the headphones with my laptop/ipad, I need to get up and go to the office and turn off my work computer that had been connected to them earlier so the headphones will disconnect. If these were 99 dollar headphones it would be less frustrating, but these cost $400. It's inexcusable."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-07-31,Prefer the Quiet Comfort 2s,"These are good headphones but there is a LOT of competition for ANC headphones. I don't really think they're worth the extra cost over the Bose Quiet Comfort II headphones. I guess if you care about Alexa, then it might be, but for those of us that think Amazon, Google, etc already have too much info about us... Alexa is not a selling point. Also, the Bose app is intrusive. It is NOT required to use the headphones but to get the full functionality out of them, you do need it. However, they work fine without downloading anything. The ANC is great as you would expect from Bose. No complaints there and even without the app you can adjust it from 0 to 5 to 10. The app let's you adjust it in smaller increments but it seems unnecessary to me. The QC II seem to have equally good NC. So if you're just buying them to be headphones, save some money and get the QC II. The voice quality for calls is superior to most other headsets I've used. It's still not as good as talking into the phone itself, IMO. So I tend not to use that feature unless I know I""m going to be on a very long call and holding the phone will be tiring. The controls on the headphones are easy to use, but this should be true for any good headphones. Overall, they're great headphones, but come with a bunch of bells and whistles that many users won't need. In which case the QC IIs are the better option."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-01,Ergonomics and interface is the best,"I had Sony WH-1000XM3, QuietComfort 35 Series I and II and 700 is the best for the following reasons:
1. Dedicated button
2. More responsive than Sony
3. Can connect to two Bluetooth devices at the same time! This is HUGE. Sony you need to disconnect from one and connect to another one. With Bose you don't have to do it. Whichever device is streaming audio Bose will connect to that one
4. Works at cold weather. Sony stopped working at a temperature close to 32 degrees by Fahrenheit. 5. Dedicated button for pausing, instead of covering ear cap and keep it held."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-02,"Opinions of an owner of QC35s. GREAT SOUND STAGE, relatively simple device activation and pairing","I like these, a lot. Asurion couldn't fix my water damaged QC35, so the Amazon credit from them went towards an upgrade. My partner has the QC35 II, so I used that unit for comparison. Setup:
I did have to wait a little bit for the device to be detected during pairing on my iPhone XS, but it eventually connected, activated, and noted that there was an update. I let it finish up with the update, which took about 20 minutes. Sound:
So, I did adjust the EQ just a tiny bit to raise the bass in Spotify, but I did the same on my QC35s. Now, I did raise them just a little more on these, so the other reviewers are right when they say the factory EQ-ing on these is a bit more flat. Now, once I had things tuned just right, I found the sound stage on a song like Charles Bradley's Changes really really impressive on these. I heard an actual stage echo effect from Charles' voice on the right side, something I had never noticed before. The song's stage felt noticeably smaller when I tried listening back on the QC35 II. Beyond Charles Bradley, they handle my varying tastes and genres great. Feel:
They definitely have a little less give on the sides, so some with large heads may feel a little discomfort. I've got a bit of a big head, so I'm still getting used to them, but it's nothing that causes me to take them off. They do seem to transfer heat out of the cavity less than on the QC35s, so it could get a little toasty for some. Tech:
I love the 10 Step ANC. There is a fade effect when switching between them or fully pausing ANC/Music to hear someone. I found on the QC35s, the audio quality of music dropped when the ANC was reduced, that's not the case here. I felt no drop in audio quality. Haven't tried Alex, but Google Assistant is snappy. This review is a work in progress and I've had the unit for 4 days, so I'll be back!"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-02,"As the late Al Jarreau might have sang, High Crime.","I got these headphones with one specific purpose in mind, replacement of my wired QC25s for superior ANC capability during air travel and with that limited focus they excel. However, if ever the clichéd adage your mileage may vary was appropriate, this is one of those instances. I don’t believe I have ever had a more perplexing tryout of a new set of headphones and I’ve gone through a fair share. I like to delude myself as being all about the sound of a set of headphones/earbuds but the reality is I am until I’m not. I doubt anyone who holds pretensions of residency in audiophiledom (yeah, I made that up) is going to bring Bose into the discussion however for the everyman listener, most often new models from this manufacturer receive will highly favorable accolades and I suppose in many respects the 700s will as well. For the record, I compared this latest offering from Bose to the aforementioned “25s,” AKG Y500, Sony WH0000XM3 and WH XB700, Panasonic RP-HTX90N-A and Cowin SE7. I also compared them to a set of wired Yamaha reference headphones to remind myself what each track I sampled was supposed to sound like but I don’t ever expect a wireless set to measure up to wired headphones so I don’t criticize the 700s for failing to do so. Oh yeah. There was a base unit Klipsch gaming headset thrown into the mix for evaluation of audio quality for Skype. These headphones might be exemplary for phone calls but for video chat, the background noise over my network sent me back to my trusty Klipschs. The rub is, as far as audio performance is concerned, to my reckoning the 700s were not overwhelmingly better than the bargain priced Sony WH XB 700s or Panasonics and only on par with the AKG 500s. In fact, ignoring the upgraded ANC, I personally prefer the audio performance of the QC25s, but of course, the wireless/wired factor comes into play again with that assessment so I guess I kinda lied above. It is entirely subjective but as far as the highest level is concerned I don’t think noise cancellation with the 700s is demonstrably improved over the QC25s. The sound reproduction here is not quintessential Bose which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but tuned to a flat or neutral response without any capability of EQ as far as musicality is concerned, this setup is at best pedestrian, most notably with the mid-ranges which tend to be over shadowed by the lower frequencies. Treble is unremarkable but generally clear. What is most disappointing is the absence of any spatial distinctiveness. Regarding features and functionality, aesthetically this design is minimalist which probably is best with the touch controls but overall I find them less appealing than the QC series and I eyeball the ear cups to be just a smidgen larger but envelope the ear equally as effectively. The primary material is composite plastic and the PU earcup cushions are comfortable. I don’t spend a great of time discussing headset comfort with any models because of the scores of sets I’ve used I think it’s been at least 30 years since personally I found any of them uncomfortable. With the inset sliding size adjustment this set does appear less susceptible to damage than the QCs where there are multiple places where they could be harmed by less cautious handling. The 700s can be connected to two devices at one time which can get annoying every time you walk out of range and the voice prompt interrupts to advise the second connection is lost. On that note, the range (represented to be 33 ft) is mediocre or at least not very impressive if any obstructions exist between your location and the source device. The touch controls for volume, tracking and play/pause are responsive and for the most part, intuitive. A personal quirk with all the voice prompts and advises I would prefer a prompt acknowledging power down of the headphones rather than a symphonic tone. Touch controls on right ear cup can be used to adjust volume levels, activate pause, track advance/replay and call answer. A USB C port for charging is also housed on the same earcup. There is a button on the left earcup to adjust ANC levels and there is a 2.5mm jack for wired audio connectivity. Pertaining to noise cancellation which is without question the major enticement here, there is a case to be made the “0” setting might be more impressive than level “10” cancellation and the highest level is pretty impressive, in my opinion once again placing Bose a step ahead of Sony. At the lowest setting even the passive level of cancellation one might expect isn’t evident as the microphone array picks up conversation or ambient sounds as though the headphones were not being worn. Yeah, yeah, there are multiple levels of active noise cancellation possible once the app is installed, before that your choices are level 0, Level 5 and Level 10 and after setting favorite levels in the app, although there is hype about 11 different levels, for practical purposes, what you have access to while wearing the headset are the three levels you preset in the app.
The headphones can be used - to a point - without downloading the Bose music app and as it turned out, might be less of an aggravation because with my iPhone 6S the app has proven consistently problematic. The app requires establishing a Bose ID or using an existing social media (like FB) ID, allows customization of headset name, choice of voice assistant (Google, Alexa, Siri), Shortcuts to hear battery level or Enable/disable assistant wake word, adjust self- voice level on calls, customize noise cancellation levels (defaults are 0, 5, 10), Allow/disable voice prompts, power button functionality so the headphones can be auto set to turn off at different intervals. BUT, without any ability to adjust tonality so you’re still entirely dependent on whatever EQ features are resident with the source device. Most often the mobile device I use for music is a Sony Hi-Res player and as the 700s only support SBC and AAC codecs, most of the benefits of my Hi-Res player are lost. With the iPhone 6s, I ended up with two Bluetooth IDs for the headset and as a result connectivity tends regularly fail, most often the headphones failing to be recognized within the app but displayed as connected on at least one of the IDs in the phone’s list of Bluetooth devices. Occasionally, I can go to the music app first and activate IF the headphones have been recognized at all. Somewhat similarly, whenever I attempt to use the headphones with a media manager app on a laptop with AptX codec, the headphones become intermittent and essentially, unlistenable. On two other laptops where I haven’t added AptX, the headphones function without problems, and as a side note, even with the availability of a decent EQ utility, it seems Bose has put in place a limiter that obviously impairs adjustment to personal sound preferences. I should also note that I have had the same issues on the same laptop with another set of headphones that do not support AptX. Latency may also be a concern for some potential purchasers. When streaming video from an A/V receiver via a Bluetooth transmitter with AptX LL codec, less than tolerable audio lag was clearly evident. I didn’t sample any of the AR apps available through the Bose music app as I wasn’t inclined to download any of the current offerings to my phone. I have enough crap taking up screen space and memory I should have deleted years ago and I wasn’t about to add some new apps I know I’ll never open again. I’m sure there are plenty early adopters out there that will care enough to try them out. The 700s are not as collapsible as QC25s/35s but the storage case isn’t significantly larger and since this time I didn’t end up with the white version I don’t have to carry the case around in a protective plastic case some pillow cases came in to keep it clean."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-02,Very impressive noise cancelling,"I always thought Bose speakers were trendy, but would not sound too good. As an audiophile, the hype just seemed too much. And a fixed location single speaker? Has! What good could that be? So I received these, read the manual, started the charging and waited to be able to laugh at them and publically mock them. It came as a bit of a shock when I put them on. The sound quality was simply amazing. Breathtaking. Deep, rich base with clear, defined treble and the midrange was keeping up with both. Okay, so I may have to eat a little humble pie on the sound quality, but the noise reduction. Surely not that good? Phenomenal. I had the headphones on and powered up, but with no audio streaming. I adjusted the level of noise control to maximum and suddenly I was in a silent room. you could just hear the background noises, but it took a lot of effort, and some were completely gone. Add in some quiet music, and you are surrounded by silence and beautiful sounding audio. I thought my wife would not want me to use them as much as I do, but I have not heard a word of complaint!"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-02,"Snap, crackle, drop...700's","These headphones are incredibly comfortable. The sound and noise canceling is also very good, but frequent clicking and crackling sounds drove me nuts. The bluetooth repeatedly dropping was also a pain. I kept thinking, ""It's not that bad"", but after a few weeks I told myself that $400 headphones shouldn't do this. They were returned this morning. I'd love to replace them but can't help but think this is a systemic problem with this iteration of headphones."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-02,Amazing sound... lacking app and support.,"These headphones are frustrating as can be. They sound great. They work great when they are playing. But Bose seems to have boxed you into their app, however. If only there was another way to connect blue tooth... well it doesn’t work. I accidentally erased the settings and now I have to hit the connect three times for it to tell me, in their app, that it’s not available. Meanwhile the headphones are telling me they are ready to connect. I think the headphones are amazing. I love Bose for speakers and headphones (this is my fourth pair including my A20 pilot headset), but as an app designer, they leave a lot to be desired. No. They suck. And when the headphones start depending on their app, that’s frustrating. Figure out your core competency, Bose. It’s not app design. Don’t make things dependent on something that’s not your core competency."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-03,Bose!!!,Bose Bestest!! !
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-04,"The app is terrible, the UI on the device is weird, but...you get used to most of it","I have deeply mixed feelings about these headphones. To make a long story short, the battery life is great, the sound is great, they are light and fit well, and they can pair to more than one thing at a time. What's not to like? Well, the user interface of both the headphones themselves—swiping gestures to change volume—and a series of inscrutable buttons that are very easy to mistakenly hit when putting on or removing the headphones...and the app.
The swiping gestures ""work"" but are hard to execute, and feel imprecise. I would MUCH RATHER have buttons. But I can't have buttons. Give me buttons, Bose. These things cost $400. Give me volume buttons or something, please. Also, woe be until you if you're left handed and trying to hit the right ear cup with the precision required to use these gestures. The other thing is the app. The app appears to be necessary in order to do things like update the firmware of the headphones, which it has now tried to do five times. However, the app simply does not work. I launch it, it fails to connect. I turn everything off and back on again, same thing. I un-pair the headphones with EVERYTHING, delete the app, reinstall, and it connects, but then crashes out in the middle of trying to update firmware. I am deeply, deeply disappointed about this app thing. I want an app to set stuff on my headphones—I really do. It could be so useful. But this app is so very broken, it cannot be used. I'm on an iPhone 7 w/latest updates, and have really tried every possible configuration I can imagine, including the recommended path straight out of the box: launch the app on the device, let IT manage pairing, etc. That FAILS EVERY TIME. Bose clearly knows this, given the reviews of the app (they are staggeringly bad), but it's still not fixed. This really bugs me. I understand user error is common, but that's not what's going on here. There is something fundamentally wrong with the app and/or the headphones, and I'm not confident Bose will be able to fix either. Having said all that, they do sound nice. And they look modern. So. We've got that going for us."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-04,Amazing noise cancelling tech hampered by bad software,"Update: I’ve also found that the Music Share feature, which was a hallmark offer Bose products is not supported on these headphones. This was very disappointing to discover. You cannot share audio with any other Bose product as of this time, whereas almost all recent Bose products supported Music Share via the Bose Connect app.
I fully expect to be upgrading this review to 5 stars in a month or two, but for now I’d downgrade these from an absolutely buy to a wait. I am constantly traveling for work and was an avid QC35 user so I jumped at these headphone as soon as they were announced. Unfortunately the device-side of these new headphones is problematic. The dual-connection function of the QC35 and other recent Bose headphones is present in the NC700’s and yet it doesn’t work seamlessly. The headphones must be placed into pairing mode at times to switch between already connected devices. Furthermore the Bose Connect app which worked flawlessly has been replaced with the Bose Music app, which was obviously built for speakers not headphones. The Bose Music app immediately complains on launch if you don’t have WiFi connected, which makes sense for Bose’s WiFi speakers but not for headphones. The app requires a login after initial setup, again unnecessary and annoying for headphones. Finally, the app often fails to connect to headphones which I can check in Bluetooth settings are currently connected. Some of this has supposedly been addressed in the latest Bose Music app update, and connectivity has supposedly been improved, but I haven’t seen this yet. Again I fully expect Bose will address all these issues with updates to the Bose Music app and the firmware, but for now they hamper the experience. Bose would have been much better off slotting these new devices into the Bose Connect app and migrating to the Bose Music app later, rather than the current strategy. I have faith in Bose and their products and do believe that in the long run all this will be addressed, but for now I’d consider waiting on this purchase or getting a pair of QC35’s on sale."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-04,Bad design - Bose opted for style over function,The QC35 and QC35 II are great headphones and have been for years. I was looking forward to these but I am mostly disappointed. You can’t adjust the volume with a button - you touch/swipe on the right ear to raise or lower which doesn’t work consistently or as simply as the previous button which let you adjust volume up/down. There’s also no clear way to switch between active devices - so if you have multiple devices paired like I do and want to choose the right one - it’s not simple to. Looking forward to the QC 35 III
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-04,Love them more than I expected,"Got these from [redacted] not here, here is my practical review. I was nervous because of the reviews here but I think I made the right choice. Noise cancellation is AMAZING. Zero setting actually brings in outside noise so you can converse. One is basically passive noise isolating of the headphones. Ten shuts out the universe (OK almost). A big plus: there's none of the ear pressure you often get with noise cancellation. Sound: I'm not an audiophile but they sound great to me. App works fine for me, but honestly all it gives you is finer control over levels of noise cancellation. Why these: I needed some great noise cancellation. I read the phone mics on the Sony high end cans were terrible, and the Bose QC35ii caused head pressure with noise cancellation. Worth the extra $50? Well I'm hoping to use these a long time, so I think so."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-04,App Detracts from Otherwise Great Headphones,"I'm a former QC35 owner, so I knew what I was getting. Overall I like them, and I don't mind paying extra for the best. I think if I were more of a value seeker I'd go with the QC35's or Sony's (though they don't have the 2 device connection like Bose). Discomfort: None, and I wear them 3 hours a day. Battery: As advertised, ~20 hours. Bluetooth Dropping: Have not experienced this yet. I did update the firmware through the app when I first opened them. Noise Cancelling: Hard to compare to the QC35 since both are good, however, Noise Cancelling (NC) 10 is unreal. I can feel a slight bit of pressure at 10 but I cannot hear anything around me (which is desired). NC 0 is awesome, truly sounds like you don't have headphones on. My colleagues look puzzled when we're having a conversation and the 700's are on my head. They don't realize how great NC 0 is. App. Not as terrible as some make it out to be, but this is the reason why they're not 5 stars. I don't really use the app for all the functions; I leave the NC defaults on (0,5,10). I would like to connect to the 700's without the app, and would also like to adjust the EQ in the app."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-08-04,Pretty unexciting. I prefer the Quiet Comforts,"Update: I'm selling mine on ebay and going back to the old Quiet Comforts. I really dislike these 700 headphones. Bose rushed these to market to compete against Sony. I am not able to see much difference between these and the Quiet Comforts; if you're rich and can splurge on the extra $50 I suppose get these. Nothing super exciting. The Quiet Comforts are rock solid and work great. The 700s are a bit touchy and take some getting used to. I keep pushing the wrong button. One thing that the Quiet Comforts were able to do was to seamlessly have to separate audio inputs (my tablet and my phone). With the 700, I find myself having to connect to the second source. It works, it's just not as seamless as the Quiet Comforts. Bose - remember that the vast majority of your users are idiots like me who aren't audiophiles."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-05,decepcion,"compre estos auriculares y la verdad que me decepcione. los comparo con qc 35II y tienen mejor sonido, pero los qc 35II son mas faciles de usar, mas comodos para transportar y mas solidos. no recomiendo comprarlos"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-06,Impressive sound quality!,"I am very very happy with these headphones! Initially I was worried about the sound quality not being that impressive because they’re advertised for so many features besides sound quality. Fortunately, although they have many impressive features, Bose didn’t skimp on the sound quality! I compared them with other high end headphones & they were actually my favorite pair for listening to music! (& I’m a very particular musician!) The noise canceling feature is amazing!!! We tested them by making it as loud as we possibly could in the room while making a phone call. The person on the other end couldn’t hear a single bit of the background noise!!! Amazing!!! They’re extremely comfortable to wear & the tilted angle of the speaker, along with the tight seal around the ear, makes the sound quality that much better! Overall, I’m highly impressed with these. Bose never lets me down!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-07,Great purchase !,I really enjoy these headphones. Sound quality and noise cancellation are very good. I had my QC 15 for many years. Now I upgraded to the 700. Great improvement !
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-08-07,Bugs everywhere,"I decided to return these headphones after 2 weeks of struggling with them to make it work seamlessly. Here are some of things I noticed
1. The iOS app is buggy. 1a. It keeps signing out and if you don't have an internet connection like on airplanes there is no way to get back in. 1b. The headphones show up as two bluetooth devices on the iPhone - one for the audio connection and I guess the other LE connection is for controlling the headphone settings even if a different device is playing audio through it. My issue was that this LE connection would never establish properly and I couldn't change the settings when I needed it. 2. Device switching is painful. I bought these headphones specifically because I can connect to two devices at the same time. I had heard that the QC35 was good a device switching, but these 700s are terrible at it. I have four devices - two laptops, phone and an iPad. It was a pain to cycle through these devices. 3. There is a lot of stuttering in audio when the headphones are at highest noise cancellation setting and the wakeword detection is on. So I turned off the ALEXA wakeword detection. Even then, there would be stuttering when connected to two devices. I don't know if this is because of issues with processing power on the headphones. I might give them a chance again if I hear these issues are resolved. But I was disappointed to see such a premium device perform so terribly."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-07,Holy Sound Quality B-Man!!,"I almost don’t have words for these headphones.... ALMOST. I’ve seriously searched and searched for wireless headphones which would cover my whole ear & remain comfortable for long periods of time WHILE I was wearing my glasses. I continued to come up short until these! The sound quality and noise cancelling alone is amazeballs. Add in a rad carrying/storage case (which also hold cords for charging and connection) comfort and usability? It makes these the most legit and best headphones I’ve ever owned, and over the last two years I’ve owned A LOT. The win for me here is I do not expect to have to buy ANYMORE! I absolutely, one thousand percent encourage everyone to get these!! !"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-08,Superb Enhancements to the QC Family,"While I did not think it was possible for Bose to improve on the design and features of the Quiet Comfort family, they managed to make significant advances. The minimalist design is both pleasing and well thought out, giving the headphones a high end feel and very comfortable to wear with controls that are easy to use; the one knock would be the power off function (more on that later). The right side has all of the touch controls integrated, honestly it did take a little fiddling around to get the exact placement down for each control but once you do it a few times the layout makes perfect sense and is easy to use and master. The overall sound is very immersive, crystal clear and true to the tracks. The noise cancellation is superb as expected; the app does give you the ability to tweak certain things to your personal preference which is nice because we all know one size doesn’t fit all. I would also add that the call quality when using the phone is great, very good at blocking the ambient noise and people on the other end have commented it sounds like I am on a landline; this is a definite plus for business travel. There is something I have always liked with Bose in particular is the implementation of Bluetooth, they have always and continue to exceed in this, the headphones are very easy to pair and have the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously; not many others that can do this and maintain a consistent connection without experiencing the annoying drops and reconnect. The reason I mention this is because I have tried several other big name competing headphones/earphones over the years and they always seem to have something quirky now and then with Bluetooth but I have never had a single issue with any Bose products, hats off to them for that because in my mind that sets them far apart in the market. The inclusion of Alexa, Siri & Google Assistant functions are nice to have and work very well. I was actually able to try all of them and did not encounter any issues with it pausing music and understanding the command request, never had to repeat the command and it executed flawlessly. Okay, now onto the only thing I am not crazy about but certainly not a deal killer; just something I need to use a few times to get the hang of. The headphones, from what I can tell, do not have a power off button per se’; there is a procedure you follow instead. I have researched online and from what I can tell, you press the “Bluetooth” button to turn them on and the same to turn off; however be careful. If you press and hold the button, as you would do with other headphones, you will actually erase the Bluetooth connections and have to re-pair them again (will take some getting used to as habit is to press and hold for power off). I have used the method above and it seems to work okay, just remember not to hold the button too long; there is also an “Auto Off” setting in the app that can be tweaked to your liking. I have had the issue mentioned in other reviews of “thinking” they were powered off but apparently not fully off and then going to use later and the battery is almost dead, I now check to make sure they are disconnected on the device I was using at the time and this seemed to ensure they would be powered off completely. I am fairly sure that Bose will tweak this in firmware updates because it seems to be a fairly common complaint. The battery life on the other hand is phenomenal compared to other options available. All in all, I would say the 700’s are an excellent buy and worth the upgrade from previous generations. I certainly have no real regrets as they are all around better sounding and the aesthetics are appealing, they are very sleek and streamlined and weigh nearly nothing; you can actually forget you are wearing them because they are very comfortable and fit great with butter soft ear cushions."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-08-08,Step backward for Bose,"My biggest complaint is you can't switch devices using a button on the headphones like you could with the Bose QC35, AE2, etc. If you have 3+ devices and 2 devices are already connected you need to do it via the mobile app, or you can go into the bluetooth settings for the device and disconnect 1 device before connecting the 3rd device. I consider this a pain, and a BIG step backward for the product. I also don't like that they're forcing you to use the Bose Music app AND signup for an account just to change settings or update firmware. My previous Bose products used an app that does not require a login to update firmware, and does not require internet to change settings. This feels more like a data-grab move than anything else."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-08,Very nice!,Very nice!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-08,Very top,Well designed. Fashion. Top sound quality. Exceptional noise cancellation feature
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-08-09,The App is unreliable and is needed to control the device. Buyer beware.,"More comfortable than the QC’s and slightly better NC. But to utilize the headphones you need the Bose Music App, and the app is entirely unreliable. Often will not connect, leaving you unable to adjust NC or anything else. Compared to the Sony these are basically a beta unit for those who enjoy frustration."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-09,No competition,Excellent noise cancellation. Superior sound reproduction. Comfortable to wear.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-09,Great noise reduction and sound,I like them. Very comfortable and easy to use. Great sound. Great battery life......
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-10,"Impressive, and I'm not a Bose fanboi","Some people think anything Bose makes is awesome. I'm not one of them. I have a Bose sound system in my car (a 2010 Corvette) and I've never thought it was as good as it should be - so I have had my doubts about Bose. But recently, I've had some very good experiences with Bose that has me rethinking them. I have a Bose Smart Speaker that is phenomenal. And these Bose 700 Noise Cancelling Headphones are also outstanding! They are VERY EASY to use - the app is great too. Many apps for speakers and headphones are a big letdown, but the Bose app is very nice. The headphones themselves are very easy to use, and intuitive. Most of the swiping movements are pretty logical and obvious. You can swipe forward and backward to skip songs. Up and down raises and lowers volume and tapping pauses. The noise cancellation is very good. You feel alone with the music. And the sound quality... I'm very pleased with the way these sound! Music sounds crisp, but not overly bright or painful. The bass is crisp and punchy, but not boomy and sloppy. I'm VERY IMPRESSED with the sound of these headphones. To me, the single most important measure of a good set of headphones is the sound quality, and these get a solid 5/5 on sound. Another important measure is comfort. I can deal with uncomfortable headphones if they sound good enough. But it is nice if they are comfortable so you don't have to deal with uncomfortable headphones. The Bose 700 headphones are comfy and sound great - so you get the best of both worlds! Price is really the only big downside. Like most things Bose, you are paying for the name, and presumably the engineering. In this case, I feel like it is worth it. I would recommend these headphones to anyone with a discerning ear who wants to hear the music up close and personal, with good sound that isn't stupid sounding like some people seem to like it. If you want it to sound hollow and booming and to sound like it would rattle the screws loose in your car, these aren't for you. If you want the music to sound crisp and clean and punchy and rich - these are the headphones for you. They rank up there with just a few other great headphones that I own. If you CARE ABOUT YOUR MUSIC, these Bose 700 noise cancelling headphones are a great choice to listen to that music with. I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT recommending these headphones. I believe that most people who get them will feel like I have lead them to a good place with these headphones. They are really that good! I hope you find this review helpful. I feel like that reviews are super important on Amazon and they really help me determine if a product is worth buying or not - so I try to return the favor and leave a review that will honestly tell you whether a product is good or not. We all use products differently, so I also try to make it clear what was important to me, and hopefully that makes it easy for you to tell if you will like it too. I also think it is important for Amazon shoppers to stick together and let each other know if a product is garbage. I WILL let you know if a product isn't good, so you can avoid the hassles of returning a product or a product you lose money on. PLEASE go to my profile page and reach out to me if you have any questions. I enjoy writing reviews and try to respond to any questions about a product ASAP. Thank you for reading my review."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-10,Amazing sound cancelation,Took awhile to get them but definitely worth it!
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-10,"Amazing sound, amazing cancellation of noise","My husband is wearing them right now, as he mows our 5 acres of ground (there is 5 acres of pond), or I would have picture. He took a break and let me know that he loves these headphones!! Sound is phenomenal, and the noise canceling feature is amazing. He is on a large mower and it cancels that racket really well. They ARE expensive, but you know sometimes you get what you pay for, and these justify every penny. I am pretty sure I will never get to use them LOL"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-10,Nice,It rattles at the hinges a bit when you walk.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-10,You’ll hear much less ... and more.,I wear these at work to make calls hands free. They’re great. When I take them off I am amazed at the white noise I now hear all around me. Wow. What a difference.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-11,huge upgrade after QC15. not so bad after QC30,i have fancy old QC15 and not-so-old QC30. N700 is huge step forward comparing to QC15. much better noise isolation. much better materials. higher level of comfort (QC15 were not comfortable if you wear glasses. N700 is ok). comparing to QC30 - i like improved noise isolation of N700 but for me N700 is too bulky (comparing to QC30).
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-11,Awesome purchase.,Best headphones ever.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-12,Almost no bass drive,"Got these thinking they’d be an upgrade to my QC 35 II. Have to say the sound quality is quite disappointing. There’s almost no bass response. In fact my AirPods have a greater bass. Noise cancellation is fantastic, much better than my QC 35s. Not sure I can recommend these though."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-12,Stop with the garbage software,"QC35II owner... wrote up a lengthy, detailed review but was initially rejected by unknown mods."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-08-12,Great noise cancellation and sound,"The name BOSE has come to mean quality sound and excellent noise cancellation and these headphones are no exception. They are smartly packaged, are extremely comfortable to use, and very easy to use with the required Bose music app with an iphone. My only complaint about these headphones is that apparently there is no Bose app for the Kindle fire via Amazon, so these headphones (as far as I've been able to infer) cannot be used with a Kindle fire, so one star is lost for the lack of accessibility. I would like to sit down and watch Netflix with these headphones on my kindle, but I don't think that is possible. (If someone does know how to make these compatible with a kindle fire, please let me know how in the comments!)"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-12,Pluses and Minuses,I found the earcups too hot for my ears. The controls were also too clunky for me. However the noise cancelling was the best there is and the sound quality was excellent.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-13,The Reason Bose Is King of Noise Cancelling Headphones,"These are quite simply the best pair of noise cancelling headphones I've ever used. That is not to say that they don't have room for improvement, but where it really counts they are incredible. Packaging
Bose has taken care to make the entire experience top notch, and that includes opening the box for the first time. The box itself is a solid cardboard with a soft cover. The headphones ship inside a very nice rigid storage case with a faux leather cover and soft velvety interior with recesses contoured to hold the headphones secure and safe while they're being stored and transported. The case also has a compartment for keeping the charging USB-C charging cable and the 1/16"" phono to 1/8"" phono cord for wired analog audio. Setup
Setup is something of a mixed bag, not because the setup process itself is tricky, but because the instructions misleadingly advise you that use of Bose's phone app is mandatory. The app is not mandatory. I did not use the app at all for this review, but more on that later. If you've used any bluethooth headset lately, the setup for these is pretty much identical. You hold the power button on the headphones for a couple of seconds - the headphones give you an audible prompt that says they're ready for pairing, then you go into the bluetooth control on your phone, find the Bose 700 headphones and pair. Done. The standard bluetooth headphone module works perfectly with these - if your phone supports it you can see an onscreen battery level for the headphones - again without needing the app.
Construction
It was clear that Bose set out to distinguish themselves visually and somewhat functionally from other headsets. The first thing I noticed is that these do not collapse into quite as small a storage footprint as the previous generation. The band is a hollow strip of metal with a large cutout across the crown where a very soft polymer (or maybe silicone?) cushion gives strain relief to the top of your head. The band gradually rolls into a tube shape and slots into a groove on outer surface of the ear cups. You adjust the length of the band by sliding the band up and down in the circular groove. The groove also simultaneously allows the cups to pivot. The cups themselves are a fine plastic with very soft faux leather cushions and generous cavities. There are three buttons all very subtly placed in the ring around the cups. They're much easier to feel than they are to see. The entire design is nothing short of elegant, lending a deceptive simplicity to what is clearly a very sophisticated piece of technology. Ergonomics
Maybe it's because I have a huge head (61cm) but I felt like the elegance of the design actually introduced a couple of ergonomic issues. Firstly while they are definitely more slender and less bulky than the competing Sony noise-cancelling headphones, they are noticeably heavier. By itself this doesn't matter because they're still very light and can be worn basically all day without causing any fatigue, however I did have some issues with the headset wanting to slide forward off of my head when I bent down to pick things up. Even though I had the band snug across the top of my head, the heft of the metal in the very top coupled with the 180 degree contour of the top cushion was enough to make them almost fall off every time I tilted my head forward. Operation (without the app)
The headset is operated with three buttons along the rim of the cups and a capacitive touch surface on the right ear-cup. The one button on the left adjusts the level of noise cancellation. Each single press toggles between 0, 5 and 10, 10 being the highest level of noise cancellation. A long press of the left button will toggle between silence and audio with the level of noise cancellation. The lower button on the right serves as your ""action"" button. On an iPhone this activates Siri, for example. The top button on the right is the power/bluetooth button. A single press turns the headset on or off. A short press (couple seconds) puts the headset into pairing mode. It can be paired with multiple devices simultaneously, though only one can be used at a time. A long press (5+ seconds) will clear the bluetooth device list. The capacitive touch surface understand several gestures that you will instantly forget if you don't use them all the time, and you will accidentally activate when trying to adjust the headset. Swiping upward or downward raises and lowers the volume respectively. Swiping forward and back will navigate back and forth between music tracks if you're listening to music. Double-tapping the ear cup will pause and unpause audio. The controls also work for phone interaction, but honestly I always end up accidentally hanging up on people before I can figure out what does what so I just leave those alone on phone calls. One note I want to make, is how impressive it is when you turn these things on. Of all of the bluetooth headsets I've ever used these have been the best performing in terms of connection. They connect with my phone almost instantly (most devices I have to wait at least 2-3 seconds for them to connect). When I wander out of range of my phone or other source, they lose connection like any device would, but they always pick it up immediately when back in range. Battery Life
Each time you power on the headset the voice assistant gives you battery life in terms of how many hours of operation you have remaining with the current charge. This is quite a bit more meaningful than a battery percentage. It definitely tracks as I will put the headphones on, it will say ""12 hours remaining"", I'll use them for about two hours and then next time I put them on it will say ""10 hours remaining"". I've not yet let them run completely out of battery, but they definitely seem to last the 17 hours that the voice assistant tells you. Sound Quality - Listening
This is the closest thing I've ever heard to a flat audio response in a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. Most headphones in this category try to color the sound and ""improve"" it in some way (usually by emphasizing bass), but I have always preferred to hear it unaltered which drives me to favor studio monitor headphones. To my extreme delight the sound I get from these are almost indistinguishable from a good quality pair of studio monitors. The level of sonic detail is astonishing, and something I frankly wouldn't have expected from wireless headphones at all. A true treat for the ears. Sound Quality - Microphone
The noise cancellation efficacy of the microphone in these is nothing short of phenomenal. With other headsets when I'm walking around outside or in a noisy environment, my wife normally complains that it's hard to make out my voice through all of the nose. Often she'll hear things in the background that I can't hear myself. Not so with these. I don't know what kind of black magic is involved in finding my voice amid all of the noise and isolating it, but it works and it works to a degree I would not have thought possible. Noise Cancellation
The noise cancellation on this headset works a little differently than what I've been used to. Not only does it cancel ambient noise a hair more effectively than the competing Sony headsets, but it selectively isolates and amplifies your own voice and other ambient sounds. It will filter out repetitive sounds like the noise of an HVAC system or a lawn mower, but you can still hear your own voice or the sound of dishes clattering etc... Most headsets I've used filter out all external noise, but the ability to hear my own voice helps me to moderate my volume so I don't end up speaking loudly to people around me. It's a great feature I would never have thought of. The noise cancellation level ""0"" makes these function like an ""open back"" headset where you can clearly hear everything around you AND whatever audio source is being sent to them. Because just putting the headphones over your ears has an isolation effect, the headset actually amplifies ambient sound to make level 0 work. The noise cancellation level ""10"" almost completely deadens ambient sound in favor of silence or whatever audio source you're listening to. Level 5 is right between the two, subduing but not completely cancelling out the ambient sound. The App
The biggest design faux pas Bose made with this set was Internet gating the companion app. It requires you to sign up for an account and log in, and frankly I'm fed up with that kind of shenanigans and I refuse to participate any further. I'm sure a lot of you won't see what the big deal is, but I work with a lot of the technology that consumes the data that's generated by the Internet of Things so I have maybe a different perspective on what this kind of data is used for and what happens to it. Suffice it to say that if you keep allowing companies little windows into your life without getting anything equivalent in return they're going to get more and more invasive and see it as their right to do so - to monitor and analyze your behavior. Their user agreements are universally designed to indemnify them and limit your rights to prosecute them when (not if, but when) the data is misused and misappropriated in a way that results in some legally definable harm to you (identity theft, profiling etc...) There is no reason for Bose to know who you are or what you are doing with these headphones which is good for you or provides you with an advantage, so my advice is don't use the app.
Summary
These are truly a work of art in terms of sound quality and physical design. Every aspect of the design exudes thoughtfulness. Even the app which I very much dislike is the product of a thoughtful intention to gather behavioral data on customers. Pros:
- Quality Packaging
- Comes with a high quality carrying case
- Comes with charging and analog audio cord
- Exquisite construction
- Easy to operate
- Solid bluetooth performance
- Long battery life
- Sound response is flat like studio monitor headphones (this is a really really good thing)
- Noise cancellation is extremely effective
- Noise cancellation for the microphone is impossibly effective (can have conversations in a noisy room and to the other person it sounds like I'm the only one there). - Lightweight
- App is not required to use and enjoy
Cons:
- App requires registration/sign-in
Nit-picks:
- The headset is a little too perfectly balanced - the band wants to slide off my head whenever I lean forward"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-13,"Great Noise Cancelling, Great Sound, Horrific User Interface and Mobile App","Bose needs to completely redesign their new Bose Music App. The bluetooth is cumbersome, every part of the UI design of the app just is poorly executed. Shame on Bose, I expected much better from them."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-08-14,No better than Sony XM3 but way more expensive,I was so excited to buy these headphones and now i'm equally disappointed. The noise cancellation is no better than the previous QC2 and certainly inferior to Sony XM3. Lack the bass and the sound quality is exactly the same as QC35-2. I'm not sure why Bose is charging such a premium price for the product. I've returned them and continue to use the XM3 - waiting for XM$ now.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-14,Very Flawed Product,Bose released this product in a defective state. The Bose Music App (which they state is necessary) is flawed in its connection to apple products. Connecting to the earphones from my apple phone has proved difficult/impossible. To bad because my earlier Bose earphones worked great. Read the website boards on the pervasiveness of the problem. Don't buy if you want to connect with apple IOS
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-14,Mostly an upgrade from the 35c,"The good: all the same sounds quality as the 35c (a bit better, but only marginally). Noise cancelling is the amazing feature here. It just works. It’s amazing switching it on a plane or train and listening to the background noise fade away. The better: the microphone is amazing. I can make a call from the center of Grand Central in rush hour, and the other end of the line believes I am in the office (actually happened). Ok, it looks dorky walking down the street with the ore headphones, but you will be heard quite well. The bad: Music share — the ability to share music or say, sound from a movie with another set of Bose headphones (say, my wife’s) is not supported here. Yet. Big step backwards. If this is important, don’t buy these yet and stick with the Bose 35c. Otherwise, a great headset."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-15,"High quality noise cancellation, and audio... when they're on!","These are definitely quality headphones for phone calls and audio consumption, wired or wireless. I have used them wirelessly with a Pixel 3 XL and wired with an Oppo HA-2SE and NAD D7050. The noise cancellation is world class, as expected, and on par with the Sony WH1000XM3. The audio quality for music comes close to the Sony headphones, but only when the power is enabled and noise cancelling is on. If trying to listen to these passively when wired, the audio quality is very tinny and frankly unlistenable. However, once powered on with full (level 10) noise cancelling, these sound amazing. Microphone quality for phone calls is also amazing! Have not had any issues or complaints with the multiple conference calls I take for work. Living in NYC, I do not normally wear large headphones, especially noise cancelling, when walking in the street. Too many variables for potential injury. One specific con: The buttons are very easy to press when placing these on/picking them up from a desk. Particularly, the noise cancelling/ambient sound button, and the power button. The touch controls function well, but I have yet to see if they experience the phantom touches that plague the WH100XM3s in cold weather. When powering these on wired, they go through a series of start-up procedures. 1. The start up sound. 2. Battery life 3. Bluetooth connected or not. Essentially, these steps require 8 seconds before your music starts playing - unless you are listening passively with them off (not recommended due to the poor audio quality). Overall, phone calls are miles better than on the Sony WH1000XM3, however audio quality (and these do not support the same technology such as aptx) is not at the same level, unless they are powered on, which closes the gap substantially. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that is primarily used for phone calls and with a secondary purpose of music, these will fit the bill and then some. If you are strictly looking for noise cancelling headphones for music playback, then look towards the Sony WH1000XM3."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,The silence is relaxing,"I picked these headphones because I wanted wireless noise cancelling headphones with bluetooth 5, I also wanted the best sound quality I can find and an effective noise cancelling. I really enjoy. Today I compared these headphones to the previous generation - the sound quality is distinguishabley better. On an airplane the noise cancelling made huge difference. I could hear at lower volume and preserving my hearing. At some points I just enjoyed the silence to sleep. I admit the connectivity to the devices is not as sleek as Apple AirPods but I trust it will become close."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-15,Absolute piece of junk,"These headphones were a major letdown. They constantly stutter/skip. They are extremely challenging to pair with (forget about unpairing one device and then pairing another). There are a lot of really annoying features - one is that every time you turn on the headphones a robot voice tells you the number of hours remaining on the battery as well as what devices you're connected to -- so if you're, say, late for a call, you'll have to sit through 15 seconds of robo-talk before being able to speak to/hear folks on the call. The noise canceling is good but I heard from a lot of people that I sounded distant/bad on phone calls. One of the main reasons I bought them was for phone calls so that was a bummer. The accompanying app is horrifically bad. Doesn't work at all -- I could barely get set up the first time. Sure, when these headphones get it together to pair, stop talking, etc., they sound pretty good and are comfortable. But once they come up against the conditions and realities of every day life / being rushed / getting a new phone you want to pair to, they immediately crumble. I would definitely think twice about spending your money on these. I'm returning them and going back to my wired QC25s. A million times more reliable + less annoying."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Doesn't disappoint,Great product. I've been wanting this headset for a long time. Glad I now own it.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-15,AWESOME!!! They are worth every penny!!!!!,The Bose 700 headphones are AWESOME!!! Anything else and you are settling for second best! PERIOD!!! It is like going out to dinner. The Bose are a five star restaurant and the rest is a smorgasbord! PERIOD!! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,amazing,amazing headset
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-15,Worth the wait,"After months of anticipation, I jumped in and bought the Bose 700 (in Silver). The noise cancellation is superb, Audio quality is excellent, full rich not overly bass boosted, nice overall sound. I use them for several daily conference calls and they work perfectly. One of the really fun features is the Alexa on the headphones. I listen to a lot of music and call up some esoteric music wherever I am...
I was on occasion hitting one of the buttons by mistake when adjusting them on my head but that is user error, I now adjust by holding them differently."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Amazing!,"The latest and greatest headphones that a name like Bose has to offer does not disappoint. They are amazing. I fly often and I wouldn’t travel without them. Sound is perfect. Noise cancelling is on point. Built in Alexa is a cool feature. The side touch pads take a little getting used to, but it’s fine once you use them a few times. I love them."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-15,Great on phone calls,I like my purchase
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-15,Children of the damned,"The Bose 400 didn't block nearly as much noise and turned off after 10 min of non use with a loud digital alert. The purpose for these was to sleep because the kids that live above us were trained in military tactics of driving someone crazy through lack of sleep. They would litterly keep jumping up and down and off furniture. The reverberation of the dance of doom deprived my wife from the sleep she so desperately needs as she works the graveyard shift and sleeps days. So I got the Sony MH1000XL Not only is the music fantastic, you can fall asleep in these without the digital alert that they haven't moved in 10 min. I haven't moved in ten min because I'm sleeping Bose... Come on. Their app is fantastic really allows for great control of the headphones. Most of all you can't hear the young hellions running amuck like cocaine covered drawves home from the mines and generously downing pints of ale. What sweet relief. I would give more stars if I could. All the collected stars from Mario 64 for the peace of mind these have afforded us. My wife was on edge. Don't think technology can help a relationship. Think again because Sony has allowed my wife to sleep, ergo I don't catch the absolutely malice she wishes upon the children of the damned that prance above us."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,high Quality Product,Complete noise cancellation. Excellent sound quality. Best I ever owned.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-15,Super incremental...Better phone calls...but rest is meh....,"Sound on bang and olufson much much better. Noise cancellation on Harmon much better
Phone calls better with this thing. Overall ok. Not a huge leap."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Good sound but hard to set up.,"The sound and noise cancellation is amazing. Once I did the software update I had no troubles connecting to the app, but is it was frustrating setting it up to say the least."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Best,"Yes, they are pricey.... But the technology is wicked better than the old versions.... Worth it if you use them often in noisy environments! Love these things"
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-15,Why they did this? QC 35 worked way better...,"I never write reviews, but I need to say that I was really excited to have the new Bose 700 so I bought one ( the Black one ). The main point is that is more difficult to turn off and even to pair it correctly while with the QC 35 is a breeze. Because I am losing some minutes to pair it correctly and even to turn it off I just prefer to get my QC-35 which is more comfortable and you just turn On and OFF simply as it should be...Did not understand why they messed with the Basic..."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Simple and to the point,"Has changeable noise cancellation. Touch controls for volume and media control that are easy to use. Has a comfortable headband, but not as adjustable (size wise) as the QCs. The microphone is amazing I got this for work calls and it works perfectly. I sync it to my phone and PC at the same time so it switches between the two seamlessly. Comes with a really nice case, and charges via usb-c so I can use my phone charger for both if needed. Has same Bose sound as QCs, maybe a little cleaner if anything but it's hard to improve that perfect sound. Bass as with Bose is not booming compared to bass heavy cups like the Beats or Sonys. Built quality is sturdy, and the band isn't that cushion like the QCs, so it won't wear or rip over time. I wouldn't run or workout in these as they are comfortable for a walking commute or something like that but due to the tension from the band if you knock one side with your arm or whip your head they will spring off. That isn't easy to do so don't think it happens easy or often just when I'm laying in bed and turn my head on a pillow is an example. Are they better than the QCs? I would say yes. The battery literally lasts how long the voice prompt tells you when you press the lower button, which is really nice. I get a day or two easy, then charging doesn't take long at all. I hope I covered everything, but if you like the QCs you will love these plain and simple."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-08-15,Status Headphones But Not As Intuitive as Expected,"The Bose name has great prestige on sound quality. Unfortunately, I'm a bit underwhelmed in that area with these headphones. They do sound rich and the noise cancellation is superb. However, these headphones are lacking the depth of bass that I like. I did try to locate on line how to adjust. The only way seems to be through on line music services that I don't subscribe to. It seems odd to have to subscribe to specific services to adjust. If I missed another way this works, I apologize but I've been searching for a few days. I did figure out how to adjust the volume and it is easy. It's just not quite as intuitive as perhaps the designers thought. I do like a number of things about these headphones. The battery is good for approximately 20 hours when charged (and had about 6 hours straight from the box). The noise cancellation works well and can be even adjusted downwards for people like me who can find it a bit too isolating. The headphones are attractive and come in their own zippered case that contains a small compartment for the charging cable and another cord for anyone not using Bluetooth. I was easily able to set up the Bluetooth with my smartphone. Since the headphones have microphones, they work well on calls. There are commands that can be used by tapping the headphones, but again I haven't quite figured these out. These headphones can also be set up with home assistants such as Alexis and Google. Although I do like the fact I can use these headphones on phone calls as well as listen to music, their short range from the smartphone is a limiting factor for me. If the headphones are too far from the smartphone, there's static. The recommended range is the same room or the next room. This does not permit flexibility for going all over the house without taking the smartphone along as well. For listening while hanging in one room or nearby, these are great. For listening while on the go, keep the smartphone close by."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Really like them,"Looking forward to having these on plane trips, I have friends with them, they are the reason I got the newest version. So far have used them while using lawn equipment. They are very comfortable, sound great. Battery seems to last forever."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Impressive,"I sold the last version for this version. The NC is only marginally better. The sound quality is noticeably better. but the usability with touch control makes this thing far easier to use. It looks better and feels great. Is it worthy of a $400 price tag? I think $350 is a better price point. Nonetheless, I think they did a much better job with this one. Oh, and the Alexa feature makes this awesome."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,My favorite headphones,"Love these! Noise cancellation is really wonderful. I used them for trips on plane and bus, mitigating most of the noise outside. Saw people complaining about the app; I’ve never used it, headphones are fully functional so I dont understand why so much hate. Very comfortable, can use them for hours straight. Touch gestures are also very handy"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-15,Not worth the money,Not worth 400.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Incredible quality for video and phone calls.,I needed a Headphone that could listen music but also to attend online meetings. Bose's headphones microphone were always great but this headphone microphone noise cancelling is a new kind of experience. It's like being in a phone booth in the middle of a cafeteria.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,Great for open offices,These are great for open offices and for your commute. I can wear them all day and still have plenty of battery life when I get home.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-15,Very good sound quality,"These headphones sound great but to use all the features you have to connect with the Bose Music app. I have an iPhone X current on all updates that could not connect. That’s why the 3 star rating. So I paid a lot of money for headphones I can’t fully use. Calling Bose support was useless, couldn’t get through so for me, this purchase was a HUGE disappointment. It shouldn’t be that problematic to get the thing to work."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-15,The bass is good but not the best,I like this one the sound is great and quality is awesome
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-16,Bose is back in the noise cancellation game,This product puts Bose back in the leadership of noise cancelling headphones. The adjustability of the noise cancellation is absolutely wonderful. You can fine tune it with the app that is available. The sound is very crisp and accurate. You will love these headphones.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-16,Not the best Bose Product,"I've had these headphones for about a few weeks now and used it extensively during my work travel. I used to carry the first gen QC35 headphones, and this is definitely a nice upgrade over my old QC35. The noise cancellation feature and setting your own level is great and works well in airports and airplanes. The sound quality on the other hand is mediocre. Sad to say, but my old QC35 has better sound quality, especially on the BASS, than the Bose 700 headphones. Overall, I'd give this product a 7/10."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-16,Outstanding! A nice improvement over the QC35s,"Functionality:
My experience connecting the headphones is that they work like any other Bluetooth headphones. I did not need to download any additional application to get them to connect to my phone or tablet. Having said that one will want to download the app and connect your headphones to get software/firmware updates. Sound:
The sounds quality has been great. The sound is very approachable and accommodating to a wide variety of music (from Currentzis to FFDP to Bonobo), audiobooks and podcasts. I migrated from the QC35 (gen. 1) to these headphones and I am happy to say that there is a noticeable improvement in the bass with these headphones. Calling/mics:
My previous QC35 were almost impossible to use to make calls because the noise-canceling did not remove the background noise. (In fact, it often amplified it.) The 700, on the other hand, have been a pleasure to make calls on. They do a good job of dropping out most of the background noises while keeping my voice clear and easy to hear. All-and-all, I'm very happy with the headphones! My complaints at the moment are they can be hot to wear, make your ears warm, and the black finish shows every fingerprint."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-16,stunning Noise Cancellation,"I tested these in probably one of the worst places, sitting on our patio, 5 wall fans running, then the garden service decided to arrive - so weed trimmers, lawnmower etc were going mad - I dialed it up to 10 and while I could hear louder , closer and intermittent sounds - the regular sounds like lawnmowers and fans were cancelled out effectively - and were shocked at how much it covered when I dropped it to 0. certainly a big jump in cancellation from my 2016 QC35's"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-16,Bose strikes again,"I love these headphones. They do the things I bought them for. I wanted good sound, I got that. I wanted noise cancellation, I got that. They work well for my travels and relaxing around the house. The only drawback is the manual description of how to operate them. I thought that could have been done much better. The information of how to operate was too automated. Words on paper are still very useful. Bottom line, I really like them."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-16,Cannot connect it to my MacBook Pro,"The sound of this device is exceptional. But, I'm a little disappointed because I cannot connect it via Bluetooth with my MacBookPro."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-17,I like it,Amazing i love it .. great looking.. great quality.. great sound
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-18,ovrall best headphones,really liked it
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-18,Great noise cancelling headphone and light weight,Great noise cancelling headphone
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-18,Activation failed error !,"Bose , please fix your iOS App! Product activation failed error !"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-19,Bose vs Sony WH1000XM3,"Having had both headphones, I went with the Bose because:
- Bose customer service is great (I live near a store). I owned my last Bose noise canceling headphones for 8 years and they replaced it once or twice, out of warranty, for free. I hope to own these for another 8 years before replacing them
- These are my travel and work headphones. I needed headphones that could connect simultaneously to 2 bluetooth devices, my laptop and phone (Sony can't)
- The sound is neutral and balanced. These are not my primary listening-for-enjoyment headphones but they are perfect headphones to help me be productive. - Not a deciding factor but the app actually works and is pleasant to use. The Sony app is barely functional. The Sony WH1000XM3 would win for you if:
- You want the absolute best noise cancellation. The Sony's noise cancellation is way better than bose. Sometimes when working with the highest noise cancellation I would look around wondering if all my coworkers had left early, it was so quiet. Bose noise cancellation is decent but no longer the best. - You don't care about music quality
Both headphones tie on:
- Touch controls - about the same (Sony wins a smidge with the mute gesture)
- Design. Bose look sleeker but frequently pinches my hair. - Mic and sound quality of calls
The Sony sound was painful. The best way I could describe it is a headphone that tries too hard to be audiophile. It emphasized odd lines in the music and frequently distracted me from my work. I played around with the different equalizer settings in their awful app and finally settled on one that was less distracting, but still bad. I honestly preferred to listen to 2010 era apple earbuds because the whole sound is generically poor and not trying too hard."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-08-19,Sleek modern design,"Bose is a name some of us know well. Sony WH-1000XM3 has (what some agree) the best noise cancellation for a consumer headphones at least until the ANC Bose 700 headphones arrive. I bought the Bose 700 luxe silver headphones for Company’s ANC and it has not disappointed me. The ANC is better than Bose QC 35 (ii). I am not a fan of 11 levels of ANC, that is just a gimmick, I think 3 levels would suffice—from no ANC, to halfway, and to all the way. The music quality is on par with Bose QC 35 and it may take a while to discern some minor differences. I was concerned with ANC so I am happy with this product. I like the sleek and modern design, too. I am willing to give this 5 stars because the product satisfied my needs (I need a Bose with great ANC), but I am not since I want to have Bose staff look at my review and realize how crappy the Bose Music app works in conjunction with this headphones. I use iphone XR with the latest ios version. This app doesn’t allow me to use Face ID to login. Come on, this is 2019 and this is Bose, not some start up company in a garage, you cannot allow Face ID while hundred of other companies do? I have the same issues with many of the reviewers where I could not connect my headphones to my Bose Music app the latest version. I am using the latest firmware for Bose as of August 19th 2019. I did, however, found a trick that works for my case, so those who use similar phones to me could try my method, too, and see how that works out. Step one, turn off Bluetooth on your phone. Step two, turn on your Bose headphones. Step three, turn on your phone’s Bluetooth. Finally, fire on the Bose Music app. I was able to connect my headphones to my app every single time if I use this method. This is unacceptable. I was able to connect other headphones from generic brands to apple airpods to my phone without first turning off the Bluetooth function. Why do I have to do this for Bose? I am happy with the headphones but not happy with how cumbersome it is to connect them to my phone. Bose engineers please read this and address the issue soon."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-19,beautiful product,"This is such a great product. Honestly, there isn't anything more I expect then great quality from a company like Bose. I have so many products by Bose and all of them are great. I do have the Beats headphones and another pair, and by far these are the best. The sounds quality is amazing, perfect noise canceling, holds a battery great. These also look great, there clean and sleek looking. This is a great gift. These are obviously very expensive, but you get what you pay for. I would love the receive these as a gift!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-19,Love,"Love everything Bose. These headphones are super comfortable and lightweight. Like another reviewer said I wish they folded up like another pair I have, but that is the only “negative” I can find and it isn’t bad enough to have kept me from buying :)"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-20,Excellent product,"Used while flying, mowing and just relaxing by the pool"
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-08-20,Sounds great when it works,"Sounds great, and synchs well via Bluetooth. The sound quality and noise cancellation are excellent. Bluetooth works great when it does, but there are occasional disconnects with the sounds. I'm not quite positive what is causing it, but because it's only occasional it doesn't bother me too badly. However, I don't quite think it's worth the cost of these headphones."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-08-20,Bose 700 - A good looking headphone with a troublesome app.......,"The sound quality for this price range is excellent. It is full, rich in its spread of the sound. You hear and feel the music more than the usual headphones you see everywhere. Are they worth $400? I must admit, this is a lot of money for what they deliver. There are wired headphones in the same price range which will exceed the quality of these cans. The real turn-off is the app which is used with this new 700 edition. Like so many other attempts at Apps (Soundtouch, Bose+ and others), Bose always seems to come up short in their ability to make an app which is user friendly and amplifies the device it controls in its features. I strongly dislike headphone buttons for any function as well. In today's world, you should be able to ask the phone by simple verbal commands to change volume or noise canceling or any other function. Maybe I am asking too much for $400 and of Bose. this is a sharp looking headphone but this is where the best part stops. I played them for two weeks and since I used them I could not return them. The teen who mows my lawn now has better ear protection and some cool looking headphones for free mowing for the rest of the summer. I will move on and try another brand."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-20,I LIKE IT.,Good product. Lots of improvement in voice cancellation.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-20,Nice noise cancelling headphone,Nice noise cancelling headphone
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-20,Good value,Very comfortable sound is as clear as my home system.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-20,Not sure if they are worth 400$,"My actual rating is a 3.5. This is my third pair of BOSE Noise Cancelling headphones / earbuds and I am coming from the 1st Gen QC35. I was hesitant to fork that much money on a pair of headsets especially considering that Bose missed the mark on pricing here considering the rollout software issues and the fact that their competition (Mainly Sony) is cheaper (MSRP to MSRP) I felt this was a cocky move on their part considering the growing competition in the segment and I can't but wonder if all of this has to do with the china trade war? In any case I decided to give them a shot through a local retailer and have been using for a few days. I thought the QC35's were the most comfortable pair I had ever tried and was hoping these would be similar but they are not. When I first wore them I almost teared up in heartbreak as I felt that Bose ruined it in terms of comfort. I personally felt these were very tight and smaller around the ears and I was in some discomfort for the first day. fortunately, they get better with use (they loosen up or your head gets used to it?) but in any case they are no match for their QC cousin in terms of comfort. Again comfort is a personal opinion/preference. I was also weary of the entire app and connection issues but luckily I have not faced major issues - it doesn't, however, take a few seconds sometimes for the app to connect to the earphones. Not a lot of options a la Sony but you can adjust auto shut off, noise cancelling presets etc...
I am no audiophile but can recognize a good sounding and balanced sound stage and I feel Bose delivers without the complexity of changing Audio presets etc...for those who use them mainly for noise cancelling the sound is perfectly fine. I was a little disappointed by the ANC as I expected to be blown away but it is not a discernible upgrade over its older sibling. You can feel the difference between all 10 levels of ANC but frankly anything below the max setting and the ANC becomes somehow ineffective. Bose AR is a gimmick - not a selling point if you ask me. Hand gestures have been working great for me and the control schemes are intuitive. As far as build quality they do look really nice but seem to be on the fragile side and could be easily scratched. I was also quite disappointed with the rubbery / cheap head band material. After just a couple of days of usage and despite having dry (I hope) hair I noticed the part has already had a usage mark on it (see photo) quite disappointing if you ask me,
These will be going back for now as comfort and features do not justify the steep pricing. I will be seeing if Sony releases XM4's next month. EDIT 8/30: So after two weeks of use, they do get more comfortable but still far from the QC35, Sony XM3's and even the Jabra 85h
one of my biggest complaints is regarding build quality - in addition to having the head band plastic discolored after a few days of use - there is now constant creaking noise from the ""hinges"" which are quite annoying especially when you only have ANC on (no music) and are just sitting and moving your head. I believe the noise is coming from the part where metallic band and ear cups are connected. so Bose has gone for looks over comfort and durability. Despite the other great features I returned them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-21,Nice Headphones,Great product. Intuitive touch control. My only complaint is that I wish it had an off switch.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-22,They're okay.,"Well I'd expect more from headphones that are this expensive, but maybe I have high expectations. First I thought is was ridiculous that you have to download a app that leaves alot to be desired to use these, with that said I had a hard time connecting to my phone, so I tried my wife's and was able to connect. The sound quality is good but I would still expect better from a premium brand with such a premium price tag. Overall there is definitely some room for improvement in these and hopefully they will take care of the app to make it more user friendly."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-22,Epic sound quality with unsurpassed noise cancelation,You put these headphones on and the worlds noise clutter instantly dissolves. Great (audiophile quality) sound reproduction AND the best noise cancelation in the business as I have the sony 2000xMk3’s and the comparison is night and day as the Sony’s noise cancelation is just about as good as last years Bose QC
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-22,Average,Noise cancelling is good but bass quality is average
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-22,Another bose to the collection,I have used all QC series till date starting from 15-25-35 but this is a notch above than anything in the market! its just amazing.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-08-22,Took too long to pair,Noise cancellation and sound quality are excellent. My main concerns are the fact that it will not work without downloading the invasive app. I had to make a new account and everything. Not cool. Battery life is pretty good. Once you get the app it will show the battery percentage and it will allow you you to adjust the noise cancellation on a scale of 1-10. I did have issues pairing it to my iPhone and so did my husband with his android. It took a good 10 minutes to fully pair the headphones. Didn’t expect that.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-24,Love these headphones!,Love Bose products. These are great
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-08-25,Yeah these suck,"No bass, not loud. App sucks. Swapping from Spotify to YouTube disconnects. Update won’t install. Get the Sony’s xm3 or wait for the 4"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-26,Sound is 👍,Nothing
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-26,That's the Bose we talking about,Too much my expectation
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-08-26,eh!,"They are good, but have so many flaws. For example turn off by themselves when dont sense motions for over 5 mins or so. So if you plan to use those for meditation you better find something else. Also the app is horrendous, I had to multiple time repair them to be able to use the app. Go to Bose form and you will see how many complaints about this new below the bar headphone. The worst part is you get no update about fixing those known bugs from Bose Engineers."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-08-27,Doesn't Work With HTC 10,"I was very excited to try these as most Bose products are fantastic. Unfortunately I cannot get the app to recognize that my phone is paired with the headphones. I contacted customer service and they informed me that they're finding that it won't recognize certain devices and they're updating the firmware, but of course they don't know when the new firmware will be released. I can still use the headphones they said, but I cannot take advantage of all the features. I can't imagine paying $300 for a pair of headphones and then not being able to use all the features. (For reference my device is an HTC 10.)"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-27,Buyer beware,I think the audio quality of these are pretty good. My issue is with the construction and the app. In terms of the construction the earpieces are comfortable and the headphones are nice looking but the metal head band adds a considerable amount of weight over the qc 35 also the case is thinner than the 35's but quite a bit wider so they won't fit in the compartment I use for my carry on bag. In terms of using the headphones bose forces you to download and use their app in order to use the headphones which also requires that you create a bose profile. I'm not sure why bose needs my name and email to make headphones work but they seem to. I'm not going to use them and will buy from someone else in the future.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-27,Loving it!,"I thoroughly love these headphones. Amazing noise cancellation, especially on the low end. I also use them for gaming on my iPad, and it is wonderful to be able to pickup phone calls without having to juggle headphones and phones to answer. The battery life is as advertised, and I can't wait to use them on my upcoming trans-Atlantic flight. Peace and quiet is always near."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-28,THE BEST for whoever is looking for call quality!!!,"Great headphones, I was looking for noise canceling headphones that will have great call quality, and the 700 are perfect, I’m working in a shared spaces and making a lot of cold calling and this headphones are amazing. The sound and NC is great, wasn’t too picky about that part. My deal breaker with all the other headphones, Sony, QC35 and others was the call quality. And Bose did very good at this one. I also love how it connects to both my MacBook and my iPhone in the same time. If you don’t care about call quality and connection to 2 devices, and just want the best sound and noise canceling go with Sony."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-08-28,Very clean sound profile and a high end build quality,"I have been using this for about a week now and I am quite impressed. I had been comparing this with the QC 35 ii and the Sony 1000mx3. I personally prefer this due to the very high end build materials which feel a tad more premium than the others. I initially felt the weight was a little more but then I reconsidered it, I am only concerned about the weight because of the stress it may have on my neck and head. The construction and angles in the headphone are so well done that the whole weight of the headphone never rests at one point. I can feel that due to the even distribution between the head and the ears, this gives a much more comfortable feel than others. The noise cancelling is great and will not give u a feeling that your ears may pop anytime. and the freedom to control that is good as well. But the sound stage is the same as all the other Bose headphones I have. It is a clean wide sound stage with precision highs, mids. The Bass is punchy and a little underpowered compared to the Sony but good nevertheless. One thing that cant be taken for granted are the materials, just the best for a pair of high end headphones .The style is minimal and works great on the office or on the move. In summation:
Go for the Sony if you listen to EDM, pop, need a lot of bass and think that the headphone should be exciting. Go for the Bose 700 if you want a comfortable, good looking premium headphones delivering good sound. Go for the Bose QC 35 ii if you don't have the extra bucks, but it delivers in all categories one point less than the 700s. I did not go into the call quality or customer support of Bose as the Sony cannot match up to these. Try talking on the phone with these if thats your thing, it will blow your mind."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-28,Awesome Headphones,"They are really comfortable, light and very good quality. Noise cancellation is amazing. Sounds is outstanding. So happy that I finally bought these headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-30,Everything is top notch,"These are beautiful sounding headphones. Noise cancelling is excellent, sound is deep and picks up all ranges of sound. The sad thing is that most music now a days are primarily in MP3 format. If you go to youtube and search for either HD audio, or flac (losless) audio you will get an even better sound and that is when the headphones really shine. I used to buy cheap headphones and am glad i spent the extra money this time around. Well worth it!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-08-30,Very pleased with these headphones,"I tried so many earbuds (RHA Trueconnect, Jabra Elite 65T, Sony WF1000XM3, M&D MW07, Soundcore Liberty Air) and the Sony WH1000XM3 before choosing the 700s over all of them. Some had video lag, some didn't fit comfortably, some had bad sound, some had a combo of issues. The 700's noise canceling is NOT as good as the Sony headphones. But you'd probably only notice if you're comparing them side by side with no other music or sound and just comparing the NC against a vacuum, hood, or some other high volume noise source. The sound quality is good, but many people prefer the Sony's wider sound stage. I felt the Sony's added too much base and it would drown some of the mid and treble details. I don't need (or really like) crazy thumping bass and I feel the Bose provides a more balanced and natural sound. Again, unless you compare them side by side, you will think both sound good. I'm not a huge fan of the app, but fortunately after configuring things, I don't use it very much so it's not that big of a deal. It doesn't matter that it doesn't have an equalizer and isn't as feature rich as Sony's app since I didn't find any value in those with the Sony headset either. What really sold it for me were the mics. I needed an all purpose solution for media consumption and for making conference calls for work. Of the 8 coworkers I polled, they unanimously chose the Bose over the Sony for mic/voice quality."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-30,Best All-around Noise Cancelling Headphones Available,"Other than being expensive (and they are only really expensive in comparison to other noise cancelling headphones and not in relation to the product quality they provide) these are nearly flawless noise cancelling headphones. I have several pairs of noise-cancelling headphones for travel and work and these retain bose's best in class noise cancelling with much better controls and sound quality. Won't lie, the new controls do take a few days of use to get used to and it did take me about a week to get over fears of breaking the headset when placing it back into the case due to the non-folding design but once I worked past those UX issues, the headphones truly are just phenomenal."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-08-31,Looks and performs amazingly,Great for running and other kinds of exercises especially if your gym is loud. Also great for just watching movies or videos at home.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-08-31,Wow,Just perfect sound!! !
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-08-31,There is a built in turn off after 10 minutes if you are asleep or your head is still,"There is a built in turn off after 10 minutes if you are asleep or your head is still. This cannot be overridden by a current firmware update etc. They turn off with a loud beep. Since I use these to sleep for travel and in general when the outside world is loud, this is a major deal breaker. The ANC is state of the art and better than the QC 35s in my opinion. No word from Bose after multiple phone calls. What a waste of energy trying to figure this out."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-08-31,"Really wanted to like it, but can’t.","I really wanted to like these headphone. I love the design, it’s minimalist yet stylist on its own. The app and connection to the phone is very on and off. I can make do without the app but the noise cancelling can’t be fine tuned. In my pros and cons list I’m comparing this with Sony xm2 noise canceling headphones. Pros:
1) Design and style is new, very minimalistic. 2) I like the app layout( when it works)
3) Sound stage is wider than xm2
4) The highs are better than xm2
Cons:
1) The top portion, is very squeaky when compared to xm2
2) The sound is good but only when there’s good connection
3) You can’t rest it on your neck, you can do that but the headphones will be exposed then. Very stupid design. 4) App lacks a lot of features that come standard in the Sony headphone (Pressure correction, calibration)
5) No eq control, Sony has eq control. I don’t care for it much though. Verdict: This product seems like a beta launch, so very buggy maybe wait for a fully baked product. Thanks"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-01,Unchangeable motion detecting auto shutoff makes them junk,"And no, they are not that sensitive to movement as Bose support stated, and thus they cut out on me constantly making them completely unsuable for the following - meditation, on a plane sleeping, relaxing in general. Bose has confirmed this is a ""feature"", i.e. an unchangeable setting different than their app setting for auto shutoff. If you are buying the system for the aforementioned, dont bother and this is not resolvable unless you want to move your head every less than 10 minutes. No response from Bose on their forums to the most ridiculous, non-customizable and unnecessarly so feature one could imagine for a noise cancelling headset. Prefer them over the Sony for comfort by a little, for phone calls by a lot (much better mic discrimination with background wind and other noise, not as good sound as Sony, but this makes them unusable for 90% of my use....and i would guess from the massive forum posts that are accelerating a whole lot of other folks."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-09-02,Excellent noise cancellation; so-so bass,"I love these headphones. The noise cancellation is excellent, and the sound quality is superb. My only problem is the bass. I admit I like a fairly heavy bass and I was only able to approximate what I like after a lot of work with the Bose app and then the equalizer in Spotify. I knew about this when I bought them and I've owned Bose products before, but if you want really heavy bass you might want to look at another product."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-03,Nice Quality,Can't beat Bose for their sound quality. I'd buy every time.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-03,"OK, I don't get the negative reviews..","I eyeballed this for a bit before taking the plunge... due to the price.. yes they aren't cheap. I did however get impatient and purchased mine at Best Buy. as I had a ton of rewards to spend before they expired. Even with the app being sucky, I simply turned the headphones on, hit the bluetooth button until it said ready to pair a new device, went into my bluetooth setting on my phone, and bam, there it was. SO who needs a stinking app? Bose should be ashamed of themselves over that app though! Now, with that out of the way, Lets get into the nitty gritty... personally, I think these sound amazeballs! I have quite the headphone collection going, with almost all the top/latest bluetooth headphones. These are far superior to any of the other ones I have. the closest two quality sound wise are the Sony WH1000MX3's and the B&W PXs. However when I turn on the Sony's, I feel pressure in my ears, like the noise cancelling is doing something weird to block out the sounds. That doesn't happen when I wear the Bose NC 700's. The PX's are very heavy and clamp down a bit much on my head for long term use.. so back to Bose, these are very comfortable. The aren't as light as the QC 35 II's were, but you'd be hard pressed to tell a difference. I use my headsets with either my iMac or my iPhone XS Max. The Bose sound fantastic on either one, and I just don't get how everyone is saying that the Sony's are better. (Sorry Sony, but thats just my opinion)
Sound is subjective to each and every individual, as I don't think we all hear everything the exact same way. Our individual skull structure or bone density can change the way our brain receives and processes sound waves, changing the frequency that our bones vibrate at as we hear sounds. So if you really want to purchase these, and are on the fence, goto Best Buy or any other retailer and listen to them, I don't think you'll be disappointed! (But yes, again, Bose's app sucks, I can't get mine to connect 90% of the time, so I deleted it)"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-03,Spectacular Bose Sound,"The first time I used these, I literally had a smile from ear to ear. The sound is phenomenal. Everything I’ve come to expect from Bose."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-04,I have never had such an issue with a Bose product,"I have only had these 2 weeks. They are going back to Amazon. The sound and bluetooth kept dropping when I was less than 10 feet from my phone. Then, as I am following the directions on the Bose website to reset the headphones, the unit then will not turn on. It will not charge, no blinking light like usual. I called Bose for technical support. The only thing the lady was able to do for me is to replace them with the same item. Almost 3 years ago I bought the Bose QC 35 seires I. My wife liked those and essentially took ownership. So, for my birthday, I bought these. We have never had an issue with the QC 35 I. So, I am purchasing the Bose QC 35 II. In my opinion, these Bose 700 headphones are too new, too much technology crammed into them with lots of bugs to be worked out. The sound in the 700's is no better than the QC 35 I."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-05,WARNING!!! DO NOT BUY,"Before I get to trashing these things let's start with the good:
1) the noise cancelling was excellent
2) sound was clear and loud
Now the bad:
1) You CANNOT use these phones without having your phone connected to the Bose Music app. This sucks because:
2) The Bose Music app is pure garbage that refuses to acknowledge your phone. This sucks because
3) Connection issues abound. There were times inwas connected but couldn't hear people (but they could hear me). I was connected to my phone, but no audio would stream through the device. And this sucks because
4) The headphones are virtually unusable. They are not consistent and would randomly disconnect from a device. even if I was connected to my phone, I had to connect to the app on the phone and that would disconnect me from the second device. Someone took this...thing and polished it up real good. But it's still just a polished piece of crap. DO NOT BUY IT. Save yourself the headache and the return struggle. I'm mad Bose would even put this out crap out into the world. If this was Game of Thrones I'd make them do the Walk of Shame."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-05,Upgraded but worse,Only had for 1 mo. And they are malfunctioning. Touch pause doesnt work well at all.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-06,Great Specs like Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C,"I bought these headphones from Best Buy and they are great! I have not had any of the issues that others have mentioned. They sound great, have great noise cancellation and the USB-C is also a welcome feature. If I could add one thing, it would be for them to support other Bluetooth codecs like aptX or something, but AAC is plenty."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-07,Terrible Headphones,"I bought these after a bad preamp blew out my old pair. These are the worst headphones I have ever used. They're fine for listening to podcasts or YouTube, but don't try using them for music. They have no EQ control, so everything sounds tinny and flat. My Apple earbuds sound better than these! Plus there are frequent bluetooth issues that make them unusable for voice calls since I constantly get garbled robot voice on the other end. Lastly, the whole ""Self Voice"" awareness sounded like a good idea at first, but it quickly gets overwhelmed and just ends up picking up everything. I could hear the person typing beside me louder than the audio on my laptop..."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-07,DONT BUY THESE HEADPHONES,I NEVER write reviews but I have to for these. I wanted to love them so bad. I liked the look and the comfort and the sound. But the connectivity with my devices was terrible. They would disconnect when I’d get calls and would play videos but there was no sound when switch from lap top to iPhone unless I re paired them. FOR $400. It just made me sad. I even got a replacement and they did the same thing. I tried calling Bose for help but the customer service was terrible. They just farm it out to some place in India. Where the people are probably being paid nothing to listen to me complain about how my fancy headphones that I can barely afford. DONT WORK RIGHT!! So TLDR DONT BUY THESE HEADPHONES. Until Bose fixes their bugs.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-08,The Business Man's Headphones,"TL;DR - These are very clearly designed for people who spend a lot of time using their headphones for calls as well as audio. If that's you, buy them. If you prioritize audio quality (and/or rarely take calls), there are better options. Call Quality
As I said in the TL;DR, these have some magical noise canceling (NC) tech behind them. When I first read about how the NC mics basically piping in your voice while filtering out the background, it sounds like voodoo. However, it works (and works well). Your voice won't be AMPLIFIED, which was my first thought. Instead, it sounds like you're talking on the phone in a very quiet and very private room. There's nothing on the market to my knowledge that can rival these and if that's the first thing on your list of wants or needs from headphones, then stop reading here. These are what you want. If not, read on. Design / Fit
These headphones come in a great case and some brilliantly-simple labeling that I feel I must mention because I irrationally love it -- a giant L and R inside the cups so you can quickly spot and don them in the correct orientation. They are extremely comfortable for long-term wear on my average-sized head and have used them while doing everything from mowing the lawn to taking calls or jamming out while cleaning. Your ears won't really suffer from ear fatigue, though it does feel like there's a little overpressure when the NC is set to max (10). Which leads me to the next point. Noise-Canceling
Bose has built a bit of an empire on their noise-canceling tech and these headphones are no exception. They can do a fantastic job at filtering out din from lawn mowers to airplanes. I have noticed, however, that voice noise (not sure what else to call it) from outside sources like a TV still makes its way through a bit too easily. Even at 10, I can still listen to and hear the TV like I have nothing on. That said, they still perform better than the NC on my Bowers and Wilkins PXs. Bose also offers a level of ""quiet"" that the BWs can't or don't with the BWs having a little bit of noticeable static in NC mode. However, this is where these two seats of cans differentiate. The BWs are for audiophiles who put music first and NC second. Conversely, the Bose 'phones focus on NC first and music second. Sound Quality
It hurts a bit to write this but...I'd say these are okay at best for music. They are balanced but flat, doing nothing exceptionally well but everything good enough. They are not BAD by any means, I am just a bit of an audio snob. If you don't know (or don't care about) the difference, then perfect. Touch Features
I have to mention this -- I absolutely loathe the touch inputs on the headphones. It is a great idea in principle but fails terribly in practice (at least for me). Since there are no dedicated buttons, you must remember the right gesture. Worse, adjusting the headphones can mess with what's playing. I have skipped or repeated songs on accident more than I care to admit. Further, the noise prompts and voice prompts can get exhausting or intrusive when trying to do things in a hurry. However, these headphones boot fast and connect instantly. If you're the type to want to wear them on calls and grab them while a call is coming in, this speed cannot be undervalued. I love the simplicity. Summary
In all, I actually end up using both my Bose and BW headphones about equally. As I have begun to do that, the lines above became more pronounced and the use-case is exactly how I make the decision. Making more calls and listening to music in between? Want something comfy for long-term wear? Need to answer that call but want the headphones to do it? Bose every time. Want to sit down, close my eyes, and relax to some beautiful music? BWs. And if I didn't own both, I would make my decision on those questions alone because they are both fantastic."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-09-09,Not worth the money,Very disappointed Sound quality OK No bass terrible
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-10,.,It’s really great
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-11,Best Headphones I've Ever Owned,"... but these are the first noise cancelling headphones I have owned. So... 🤷🏼‍♂️
Battery life is great. I get 19+ hours out of a full charge. Noise cancelling is also great- I watched 6 movies on my flights between LAX & Sydney and heard nothing but the movies themselves. (And I didn't even listen at full volume). Very comfortable, even after multiple hours of steady wearing. Would definitely recommend."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-09-11,Step backward for Bose,"Nice headphones, but not a good upgrade from my previous, Bose QC 35II wireless noise-canceling headphones. The sound quality is good and the USB-C charging is nice since my iPad and Macbook use the same. My biggest problem, and it is an incredible annoyance, is the lack of a device switching button. On the QC 35II's you can press up on the power button and the headphones will cycle through the saved Bluetooth connections. I have multiple devices I use with these headphones (iPhone, iPad and at least two computers). With the QC 35II's it is simple to select the right device to connect to. With the 700s it is impossible to switch devices without using the app (which only sometimes works) or re-pairing with the device. This is a monumental step backward. I bought these headphones before leaving the country for a few weeks so I am past my return window, otherwise, I would have returned them by now. Hopefully, Bose will release a firmware update that corrects this colossal oversight. For now they sit on a shelf while I continue to use my old headphones. If an update doesn't come out soon I'll probably sell the 700s on eBay."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-11,Amazing. Just Amazing!,"As soon as you have the box in your hands, you know that you've got some high-quality stuff. The box is weighty with the coolness and class that's inside. Okay, so I'm impressed with the box-- it's a nice hard side presentation box that contains the headphones safely stored inside in a padded zipper enclosure, custom made to fit the Bose headphones. It comes with a well laid-out instruction book, that is easy to read and not super tiny print like are included with some devices. To set it up, first, you need to download the Bose Music app to your phone. It's available in Android or Apple, so no matter which side of the phone street you're on, you're good. It doesn't say anything about Windows OS phones, so you're kind of on your own there. Once you get past the first two pages which have clear pictures and English instructions, you've got 6 pages of other languages with the same to instructions. Install the app, press the power / Bluetooth button. I'm guessing the app will have more instructions. it's kind of a good thing the picture shows the location of the power button because the buttons blend in pretty good with the main body of the headphones and aren’t labeled well. That lends to the overall cool look of the headphones, but it makes it a little more difficult for older folks that use bifocals like me to find the button for the first time. When you have the headphones on a pleasant woman’s voice comes on, and tells you which device you're connected to, in this case, my phone. It's easy to connect the Bose headphones to your telephone using the app. Probably just as easy or easier than any other Bluetooth. The Bose advertising or description of the app says that it's a one-touch program for all of your music. However, the app is very simplistic and seems to exist only to connect your to phone to the headphones. Even though it says that there's some sort of a free music program that comes with it, I see no way to access this music program, called TuneIn. A search of Google play found an app called TuneIn that specializes in podcast NFL broadcast and music, along with audio ads. So, to me, it sounds like live radio that you can listen to through the headphones. Isn't that what Pandora and Spotify already do? That aside, the sound response on these is phenomenal, which you would expect on a product with the name Bose on it. They are comfortable to wear, adjust to your head easily and even though they're noise-canceling you can still hear through them. When I first put them on I noticed that all of the normal background noises in the house where severely dissipated. You can still hear some of them, I guess it depends on the frequency of the sound. I can hear wifey clearly, but not the fan noise from the air conditioning. Using the headphones to answer a telephone call is a very good experience. It was a much clearer phone call wearing headphones than it was with my normal telephone response. They have several built-in microphones in the headphones for the noise canceling, and they pick up your voice with no problems whatsoever. The person on the other end of the phone call said that they could hear me much more clearly than normal. Again, Bose audio stands up to their phenomenal reputation. I'm a little disappointed in the contents of the instruction book, no matter how easy it was to read. I've never had a higher-end headphone set before and instructions really aren't intuitive. In playing around with it I figured out that you could pause function of the headphones and turn them off with some of the side buttons and then referring to a small insert piece that was in the package [that I has laid aside without reading] I discovered that you could change the volume by stroking up and down on the right side. You can hook these up directly to your stereo or whatever your audio source with the included male to male wired audio jack. Run time on these batteries is amazing, without charging it up, and using only the charge that came on them I've been playing with it for over an hour so far and I still have 5 hours plus of battery. I found that out by touching and holding the right side. The same female voice from the setup that tells you when you're connected also tells you how much battery time you have left. After a little searching online, I downloaded the full manual from the Bose website. This included a troubleshooting section which advised me to uninstall and reinstall the Bose music control program to fix a lot of problems. I did that, and went through the setting up of a Bose account and allowing permissions to the phone. I don't really understand why it needed location permissions, [and permission to everything but the kitchen sink] but a lot of apps these days want to know everything. Once I got the new version of the app installed, everything proceeded a lot smoother. After you get everything set up, inside the app are manual settings for the noise reduction, allowing you to set your three favorite levels, settings for the volume of the headphones themselves, and volume of the little notification voice. You can interface this with Alexa or Google, but I haven't gone down that rabbit-hole yet. Inside the app, again once you set everything up --but you can't see anything in the settings until you set the darn thing up and register it. Then, you’ll see there's a tutorial-- step-by-step telling you all about the headphones. Explaining the touch gestures on the side of the headset. I got to admit that part is pretty darn cool. Being able to adjust volume, answer the phone, activate your Google or Alexa, even accept or decline phone calls. I'm guessing it has some sort of a touchpad type thing built into the plastic of the side of the headphones. After wearing these and listening to music as I went about the normal household chores, I was shocked to see I’d been wearing them for almost 2 hours! These aren’t heavy at all and are quite comfortable to wear. Furthermore, it was a bit of a change to hear all the normal house background noise. These do work well at canceling the drone of small noises we hear all the time and stop noticing after a while. So, are these worth the bug bucks? Normally I’d say no just because of the cost, but these are really a great set of headphones. From what I can see, Bose is the best at what they do, and look cool doing it. Thanks for reading my lengthy review!"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-11,Horrible bluetooth pairing and poor ear pad quality,"I have both qc-25 and qc-35 for a long time. This model is unbelievably bad. It is extremely frustrating to pair it with different devices and every time I want to switch between my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone, it is a nightmare. After only 2 months of use, the ear pads started cracking! There is a small crack on the right ear cup pad that is growing steadily! The previous versions didn't have the same issue after 1-2 years of use each. At this price point, go buy two qc-35s!"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-09-11,Sounds Good,"It does not have a deep Bass but it still sounds pretty good, the only problem i have is that sometimes the bluetooth goes crazy and there is a lot of static noise, i wish i had more time to return it, but now i am stuck with this pair, good luck!"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-09-11,NC700 pros and cons - All is relative,"Got a pair directly from Bose replacing QC-35’s shortly after the NC700 release. Experiences:
1. They worked out of the box pairing with iPad and iPhone *without* the Bose music app present. Note: you do *not* need the app to pair the headset to a Bluetooth device to use for audio streaming from that device (including phone calls). You can have two devices simultaneously paired and accessible without the app installed, similar to the QC35. The app offers access to more of your BT devices if you need to switch a lot as well as other bells and whistles. It is also a means to Bose firmware updates (if and when they are released). 2. After Bose updated the music app the NC700s are now functional in the app.
3. NC is effective, perhaps on par with the QC35s they replaced. A subjective call but not better to this user. 4. Telephone conversation is (apparently) a design selling point. It’s easier to use and clearer than the QC35s. If you do a lot of phone, this is a plus. 5. Comfort is, for this head at least, reduced with the NC700. Again, an individual thing. The clamping force is stronger on lower ear areas. If you have larger than normal ears, and you wear the set for extended periods, there will be a fatigue factor that significantly exceeds that of the QC35s. So, extended wear, beware. 6. Auto Off. The NC700 has an auto shutoff (to preserve battery) which shuts off the headphones if not physically moved for 10 minutes. This cannot be turned off. This is a show stopper for many users who fall asleep wearing them, meditate or are otherwise inactive for a short period and are shut down in doing so. Bose is presumably working on this and may address in a future firmware update. But . . . Bose has a controversial history of firmware updates ‘breaking’ the NC of the early QC35 line. 7. Noise canceling. Aside from the report in 3. above, the NC in the 700 works differently. The so-called ‘cabin pressure’ effect is gone. This feature of the QC line was/is loathed by many and loved by many. So, depending on prior experience with the QC line and personal preference the prospective upgrader here should take note. Reportedly the Sony top tier model retains this ‘feature’. 8. Bose to their credit does a creditable job moderating a community blog support site and moderators provide timely, if maddeningly limited in some issues, support. The forum is not directly obvious from the main company website geared to selling product. It resides at bose(dot)community(dot)com and is a very good adjunct resource to Amazon’s indispensable review section here for those doing research."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-11,These things are amazing.,"I bought these for a friend. He just used them on a flight from SFO to St. Petersburg, Russia. He said the plane ride was totally quiet and he was able to piece together and edit two piano concert videos while on the flight. The built in microphones are pretty amazing also. We FaceTimed from Piter and his voice was crystal clear. They are pricey for sure but remember you get what you pay for."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-12,An Improvement over the C 35's,"This is about my fourth pair of Bose NC headphones. Some have been sturdier than others. These improve on the noise cancelling (which is mainly what I want for long flights, even without music). The Bose app and pairing is clunky, and it took a while to get these working correctly. The minimal instructions are not helpful. But once paired they worked flawlessly. Sound quality is always a matter of taste and impossible to review. I would say these are very neutral sounding headphones. Many have complained of the larger case and the fact that they do not fold up. Honestly, that is exactly why I do like them. You just lay them in the case and you are done. I used to struggle trying to fold up my other ones while landing. They really are not that much larger. The closing cord compartment in the case is a good idea but could be larger. I do wish all the manufacturers had not gone to dedicated rechargeable batteries. It is so much easier to carry AAA's for a quick change. I am still happy I made the upgrade. The jury is still out on durability. Only time will tell."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-12,Great quality headphones!,"These headphones are of great quality! I purchased them to reduce the external noise I experience during my commute. Testing both on the train and airplane, the noise cancellation is amazing! I really did not understand how loud the airplane really is until I used these headphones and took them off mid flight. Call quality is great as well! I'm able to take a call in a crowded, noisy environment and the person on the other end can hear me clearly. Sound quality is great. I've always liked Bose's sound signature and these headphones do not disappoint. If you are looking for booming bass, look elsewhere."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-09-12,Forces you to use the Bose music app which sucks!,You need to register using the bose music app to get these to work...
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-12,One of the best noise canceling headphone,"I had a problem at the first firmware update; there is a procedure that wasn't clear on Bose docs, That: It is important to Clearing the headphone pairing list after update software to make old list bluetooth pairing works again. Solved that problem, It's became to me the greatest headphone I have ever seen."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-13,Awesome,Awesome puts the Beats go shame
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-09-13,Not worth the upgrade,"I have done some extensive testing on these headphones in hope they were better than my exiting QC35's, but sadly they are going back to the store today for all of the below reasons. Firstly what they are good at:
1) The audio microphone is a marked improvement for calls
2) The sound effects of turning off and on and engaging and disengaging a call are cool. 3) The sound is still high quality. 4) The noise cancelling is improved over the QC35’s and in my opinion the NC is better than the Sony’s. The Sony NC actually creates a pressure in my ears/head when activating the NC feature, but either Bose do not. So what's the problems then, it basically comes down to naive oversights on design functionality? 1) They turn off on there own accord randomly
2) The focus on esthetics has resulted in a head band that makes them place more pressure on the top of the head. What happened to the very practical solution of a soft strap across the top which fit everyone head shape with perfectly weight distribution. 3) The head band is aligned further forward than the QC35's resulting in the headphone twisting forward on the ears often when in motion or doing normal actions of moving around, which results in require frequent realignments
4) The touch pad is not as user friendly as the idea sounds. It is surprising how often it is accidentally hit and how often when you are trying to get it to do something that it doesn’t work first time requiring repetitive efforts to get it done. ALSO the adjustments are simple not controllable enough as the adjustment are either to much in most cases, but some times it does work so your having to repetitively repeat your task to get the correct volume. Also your hand angle is not always the same or the same location when trying to find something without direct line-of-sight so you find yourself to locate the correct position before swiping otherwise you will have to do it twice. Swipe is not always better, developers found that out with mice wheels. It simple does not have the dexterity. Also keep in mind that people are in many positions using the headphone, not just sitting or standing up straight. When I lay down the touch pad is more of a problem than benefit. 5) The buttons are to low profile, so it is not quickly recognizable of its location. Keep in mind that in practical use a person is trying to find the buttons without being able to see them. A higher tactile feel is needed so one is not sliding up and down looking for the correct placement. The QC 35 buttons worked much better. 6) your head will need to be not to thin or too thick otherwise you’ll have tapping of the joint and casing creating a sound that resonates into your ears. 7) The required APP is not so easy to get as a search of the APP store did not locate which one was required. I need to go to the product page and use the link at bottom to be referred to the correct APP. Also the APP demand registration of an account otherwise you can’t use it which is tardy and intrusive at best. 8) The headphones at start-up report the previous power at shutdown, not the current power and bootup and connection is slower than the QC35’s. 9) Answering call using the touch pad is not all that successful either due to al the flaws noted above. I have missed several calls for this reason alone. It works ok in a controlled environment but in real life use everything is not so perfect with different angles and different thing on your fingers creating more obstacles for the user. 10 Lastly the button to enable speech is not to functional because you must hold and press after you locate the button. All of which takes time and conversations happen quickly, so people are waiting while you fumble with your headphones before having a fluid conversation. This feature implementation is much better on the Sony headphone with the ‘just place your hand anywhere over the cup’ solution. I think it’s better value and performance to stay with the QC 35’s. I’m removing my add to sell my QC 35’s and keeping them until Bose gets the practicality of use back on track. It’s nice for them to look cool and have features but if you can’t use them, they are nothing more than a paper weight. Three stars is the best I could justify considering all the deficiencies. I’m surprised of the amount of oversights considering it’s Bose"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-13,Disappointment. For a high price that isn't right (at all).,"True to Bose for years, I was very disappointed by this Bose 700. After the release of the Bose QC35 II completely without evolution (except for a button) compared to its predecessor, and sold at a high price, the American manufacturer continues to rest on its laurels (but it's not the king anymore) with the Bose 700. So, the helmet is very beautiful, although we can deplore the lack of practicality of a non foldable helmet and seems fragile enough for a nomadic helmet. And after using a product from a competing manufacturer, we can wonder if the majority of manufacturing costs haven't been spent in designing the headsets : these headsets are pretty ok, let's be fair, but the price does not justify (and by far) a perfectible, active noise cancellation (below the Bose QC35 first of its name) and a sound transcript that's really bad in the extremes of the sound spectrum. If you are looking for an headset with effective ANC and sound transcript, go take a look at the same price range headsets, and you will save you a few dollars (for a far better result)."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-13,Worst headphones i've ever used,These headphones are rubbish and beats are better
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-14,Using for routine phone calls in home office - works great,"I've only had the set for a few days but I love them. I have a huge head and they fit just fine, so big-headed people need not worry. I use the set for making 3-4 conference calls per day. I previously used gaming headsets because I like over-the-ear headsets with a boom mic. The problem with the gaming headsets I had was lack of noise cancellation, which was especially pronounced when my loud AC unit was running 5 feet away. The Bose 700 cuts out all the noise for the caller who normally complains about it. The most amazing surprise was how much benefit I'm getting from less noise. At level 10 NC, I literally cannot hear the loud AC unit. It is like magic because I do not understand how it works, but it does. Very cool technology. The app works fine, so does Google assistant. So far, no issues. I'm happy I went with this model because it is primarily used for phone calls in a loud home office environment."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-14,Amazing sound & noise cancellation,Love these headphones. Was concerned before they arrived that the design would make them feel super fragile but that isn't the case.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-14,As expected,Didn’t cancel noise as I would have liked. Sound quality is great
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-14,Greatest voice Pick up,"Here are the great features of this headphone:
1- better noise cancellation than previous Bose headphones,
2- amazing voice pick up in noisy environments
3- easy to use with touch features"
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-09-14,"Disappointing, Less Stable, Nice Style, Expensive","I own three Bose headphones...the non-NC Bose SoundTrue, the QC25s, and the QC35II. Of the two NC units, the QC25s are my favorite as the 40 hour battery life far exceeds the less than 20 I get with QC35s...and I know someday they will fail when the battery dies. I had the chance to try these 700s for an afternoon. As some others have said, these seemed less stable on my average-sized head, but did produce excellent sound and NC. The app is OK and I found it workable. I just kept asking myself what the real advantage of this is over the other two NC phones. Other than the high price, and the different exterior style, I found the few tech features nothing worth choosing over the other two. I would have thought Bose would somehow advance the battery play time between charges, though as mentioned, I prefer the user-replaceable battery that requires no charging. All in all, I am glad I tested these out. They are fine, but for a new model I found them clearly not superior to my other two NC Bose headphones. And, unfortunately they are three times the price of the QC25s and more than a third more than the QC35s."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-15,Works as intended,"Let's be real, if you're reading a review for these here, it's not an item for you."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-15,By comparing with Sony Noise cancelling series,"Bose 700 opens new world!!! I have used Bose QC 35 I, and Sony WH1000XM3. Today, I got Bose 700. The most impressive things are that Bose takes touch pad function and noise cancelling adjustment function. By comparing with Sony Noise Cancelling, this is pros and cons for Bose 700 (Briefly, Bose 700 still has the strength of Bose Noise cancelling series and adopts some strengths of Sony) :
- Pros (Traditional strengths of Bose):
1. High Sound quality
2. Bluetooth connection and distance stability
3. Light weight
4. Fitting (Ergonomic)
5. Design (Metal - looking good)
6. Clear sound quality in hands free
- Cons (Traditional strengths of Sony)
1. Subtle Noise cancelling adjustment (20 levels - Bose has 10 levels)
2. Adaptive sound function (Bose does not have yet)
3. Sound direction adjustment in the app (Bose does not have yet)
4. Voice sound in the environment can be amplified if the app is used (Bose does not have yet)
5. One touch to cancel the noise cancelling function temporarily (Bose has the adjustment button - If right hand grab right side of Sony headset, you can cancel noise cancelling function temporarily). 6. Battery Charging cycle (Bose seems to be the same as Sony but somewhat not like Sony)"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-16,These Spy on You!! Don’t Buy!,"The headphones work well but THEY SPY ON YOU! According to their privacy policy the record and send to Bose all of your usage data - what you listen to, what time, what buttons you press and when.... Come on, does abode really need to know my pattern of life to make a speaker?? Are they also recording my private phone calls?? From privacy policy... “Usage data, such as time spent using different features/settings of the product, the day and time you used the product, button presses, the media and other external sources to which you connect your product, and, as applicable, your product’s power spectrum, sound pressure level, volume levels, and streaming information (including content stored on system presets, stations played, playlists, artists, albums, songs, or podcasts), time zone, and transactional data enabling digital rights management (e.g., for music content providers to give appropriate credit to artists depending on how often their content is played)”1"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-16,Disappointed. No bass. THEY FALL OFF YOUR HEAD IF YOU LOOK UP,"I’m sticking with my $200 AudioTechnicas. Case is huge, they don’t fold like the old ones. The sound quality is piss poor, in the sense that the bass is non existent and they don’t make my music sparkle, they just sound kind of clear and cancel outside noise. They are ugly and look like ear muffs attached to a dress thin headband. They feel solid, but that weight actually results in them sliding off your head even in the smallest setting (I wear an XL size helmet) when you tilt your backwards or lay down. They come with a propriety auxiliary cord so if you lose it good luck using a wire. The app sucks and is a huge invasion of privacy, and doesn’t even have an EQ setting mode. Uses usb type c, comes with a tiny one foot cable but no brick or anything to plug into...horrible value. Got these as a gift and was so disappointed"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-16,"After Bose, all other headphones can't compete","After touring as a musician and running the sound board for a musical group for several years, I developed a very particular set of standards for the music I listen to and the devices I play that music with. I'm really, really picky. I've never had trouble finding good quality speakers, but the search for good quality headphones has been nothing short of a quest. I've gone through headphones from many well known top brands. I've spent hours testing headphones in the stores. The problems are always the same: no real bottom to the base or no clean presence in the highs. With every headphone it was one or the other - or both. My quest for the right headphone has ended with the Bose Headphones 700. The build quality of the Bose Headphones 700 is remarkable - solid construction with great materials that delivers a real feeling of quality. The headphones are lined with an amazing padding that is so soft it's almost decadent - when you put the headphones over your ears it fells like you're wearing velvet covered butter. I've spent hours wearing these headphones with no discomfort or ear ""sweats"". I typically don't like wireless headphones as they tend to be difficult to connect, subject to disconnects, and I don't like having to constantly recharge them - I have got enough rechargeable batteries in my life. The Bose headphones connected flawlessly for me and have never given me the least hint of breakup, even when walking to the opposite side of the house from my music source. They do require charging, but you'll get 16+ hours of listening time on a single charge, which is remarkable. And the headphones use a standard USB-C cable for charging so no proprietary cable is needed. You can control volume on the headphones in wireless mode by sliding your finger up and down on the right ear cup, and pause and restart your audio device by tapping at the same spot. And of course, you can connect with the included audio cable as well. All that fits in a nice carry case so you can take it with you. You can jump from three sensitivity levels of the noise cancelling by pressing a button on the left ear - defaults are none, halfway and maximum. You can change what the three levels are using the Bose music app.
All that is to say the Bose Headphones 700 are a joy to war and easy to operate. The user guide that comes with the headphones is almost worthless but you can find a good manual on the Bose website. And then there's the sound - Unlike any other headphones I've found, these have a real bottom to the bass. Most headphones have a very shallow bass or a boomy bass that gets very muddy; these give you real depth without being sloppy about it. The upper end is crisp and clear. You get that nice clean ""tss"" sound from the high-hat and the snare drum and the upper octaves on the piano sound wonderful. The effect of these awesome lows and highs is that you experience a real presence to the music that is almost impossible to find with headphones. If you enjoy listening to the piano, you'll really love this- you'll fell like you're sitting in the concert hall. Listen to ""On the Run"" from Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and you'll fell the sounds crawl across the back of your head as they switch from side to side and the rumbling of the thunderstorms underneath. I tested the Bose Headphones 700 with a wide range of music from Manheim Steamroller's ""Carol of the Bells"" to Harry Nilsson's ""Jump Into the Fire"" to the London Philharmonic's ""Ride of the Valkyrie"". From Josh Groban's ""Remember Me"" to Amy Lee's ""Bring Me to Life"" to Muse's ""Uprising"" to Brooks and Dunn's ""Neon Moon"" and more. The Bose Headphones 700 sounded beautiful on all. The Bose Headphones 700 are not cheap, but they really are an example of paying for what you get - and getting what you pay for. My quest is over. I'm done looking for headphones. For me, the Bose Headphones 700 are the grail I've been searching for all along."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-09-16,LET ME DESTROY MY HEARING IF I CHOOSE TO,"Full disclosure, I've never had noise cancelling headphones before. I'm a huge fan of the in-ear Bose IE2s which I've had maybe 3-4 pairs of but I'd recently moved to another company with an open floor plan (no sound privacy). This caused me to look into getting the latest and greatest noise cancelling headphones. Given my previous experience with Bose, i'd shot for the moon and dropped $400 on these bad boys. They are definitely revolutionary in terms of noise cancelling and they look absolutely awesome. However, I feel like there are two MAJOR flaws to the headphones (not sure if they can fix with a Firmware Release):
1. The base is sub-par. The quality of sound is super crisp and best with noise cancelling at level 10, but the BASE is definitely lacking for $400 headphones. LET ME DESTROY MY HEARING IF I CHOOSE TO. In other words, allow the base to scale with the volume and let me lower the base if I need to... for $400, I should have brain-shaking base...right? 2. The sound quality is crisp when connected to your phone via bluetooth BUT as soon as you connect to your laptop through bluetooth (I have a brand new 2019 Macbook Pro 1 week old) the sound becomes almost like listening to a radio with zero base. The base is completely gone. Easily reproducible and happens 100% of the time. When switching to AUX to macbook, the quality dramatically improves back to what it was with bluetooth via phone so idk what's wrong there but assuming this could be a firmware fix. All in all, I can deal with listening through my phone via bluetooth until a fix is released, but I'm really really hoping we're given a firmware fix for increasing the base and retaining the quality. I really expected much more base from Bose for this price of headphones. My in-ear IE2s sound better in terms of base... I'm 50-50 on keeping vs returning and getting the Sony WH1000-MX3s (don't look as good but much better reviews)"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-17,Kindle Fire,Just talked with Bose customer service and the headset does not work with the kindle fire.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-17,World class worlds best.,Great looking classy product with quality of build and sound to match. A step up in many respects on the QC35.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-18,Excellent all around,"I was hesitant to pay the extra money for this model but having used it regularly for a couple weeks I am 100% satisfied. The comfort is beyond my highest hopes, the sound cancelling and quality are right on my expectations. What has REALLY blown me away is 2 Bluetooth connections on one device, that is a feature I could never live without again."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-18,Typical superb Bose sound quality,The most comfortable headphones I've ever used.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-19,Bose hasn’t released something this bad since the 321 II DVD player,"So, I bought the QC35 first, I was really happy with them. But, it was within a month of the new pair coming out. So, I returned and I bought this pair and was kind of happy. The device itself is great. The issue is with the software and the app. Here I am having to delete my device history on all my devices again, because the app does not work for... so, I link a new device. I have it linked to my TV’s cable box, a separate box for Netflix, my phone, and my computer. My phone had the app, I find that my phone pairs with the BT headphones under two different names. When I want to us the app to control the head phones, it won’t link up to them! Great job Bose, the second time I’ve been burnt on one of your excellently inferior products. To remedy, you have to reset your device history on every item it’s paired too. That’s f-stoping stupid! Also, when you wear the headphones on your neck, the invisible touch buttons activate while touching your neck. So, your listening to an audio book, someone interrupts, you put them on your neck, book starts back up. Lots and lots of kinks, stick with the tried and true QC35, or the Sony. The Bose music app was not ready for launch, and has probably already been deemed a failure. The app, and site will probably never be fixed. Avoid this product, treat it like Bose treated its 321 II DVD player (didn’t play DVD’s, and yes Bose, I did get your useless update cd that didn’t do s-stop... connected, but not connected..."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-09-19,"Don't buy if plan to use without moving (sleeping, meditating, on plane)","There's a bug where these headphones turn off automatically (with loud noise) if you don't move for more than 10 minutes. I learned this by trying to sleep with them this past weekend. Bose says they're working on a fix, but as of now I'd hold off buying them if you plan on using them like I do."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-19,Wife loves new Bose Cancelling 700 series,She said they wound fantastic
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-19,EXTRAORDINARY...,Headphones far exceeded my expectations!
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-20,The most aggravating experience imaginable,The software situation is horrible. I spent hours on tech support. Can't even turn the headphones off. Absolute nightmare. Can't wait to return them.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-20,"So Quiet, They Mute the World","I've owned and currently own a lot of Bose Headsets starting with the Bose Aviation Headset in the 90's when they effectively invented active noise reduction. These are on another level from anything Bose has ever released. The noise reduction is beyond quiet - it mutes the world. And without that subtle hiss in the background with previous Bose Headsets. The swipeable controls on the right side of the headset are something you expect Apple to invent. Swipe forward to go to the next song, back to go to the previous, up to increase volume and down to decrease. No more trying to double click a button or feel around the headset for the volume control. It so simple, but so good. And finally you can turn off noise reduction and have a conversation with the headset still on your head because the headset passes the conversation through four built-in microphones. No more pausing your music and taking off the headset to answer a question. Get these and then tell all your friends to get them. Their amazing!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-21,Very Very Nice,"My 1st Generation Bose NC Headphones are 15 years old and beat to hell, time to upgrade. I wanted top-of-the-line, so that's what I ordered. These are $400 everywhere, but if you buy them from QVC you can pay 5 payments of $80 - same as cash, and free shipping, so that's cool. They look and feel amazing. I have a big head and they are a bit tight, so not sure how multiple hours of use on an international flight is gonna go. The touch controls work great and the phone feature works perfectly. The sound quality overall is awesome. These are not heavy bass headphones, which is fine. The clarity is just a smidge below my AKG K240's, but that's to be expected - those are 55 ohm phones. Listening with the Bose, you can really hear all the detail - listening to the Who's Squeezebox, you can really hear all the cymbals and tambourines. Listening to Carla Bruni sing Quelqu'un m'a dit, you can hear every cigarette she ever smoked! The noise cancelling is amazing and exactly what I would expect from High End Bose headphones. Look if you just want bone rattling base and a name brand - buy the Skull Candy or Beats. If you want something more refined - these are for you. I am not such an audiophile that I could tell the difference between these or the top of the line Sony's, but I am very happy with the Bose, and I know they will last. Highly recommended and well worth the price tag."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-22,Bose Vs Sony,"The competition for these headphones are steep (Sony vs Bose), I ended up with Bose for two reasons, 1 - exponentially better call quality, and 2 - comfort. I recently went on a work trip to Europe and took these with me, i was extremely happy. I wore them the whole way there and back and had no issues wearing them for the 12 hour flight. In addition, the made the trip peaceful and almost enjoyable, I had no issues listening to podcasts or movies, on the plane with the volume relatively low. Finally, I was able to make calls in the airport with ease and the receiver was able to hear just me and none of the back ground chatter."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-22,"A+ noise cancellation, B+ sound quality","Former mix engineer- now software engineer in a noisy work environment. I love these headphones.. not necessarily for sound quality, but because turning them on feels like I'm ""shutting the door"" to my non-existent office in my open-floorplan work environment. I would buy another pair instantly if I lost them. The sound quality is ""ok"" but I'm a snob used to studio grade headsets. I wouldn't use these to mix a record, or if my primary reason for purchase was sound quality (although if you're not an audio professional, these might be A- to A+ for you..), but that's not why I purchased. These give me a tiny sliver of perceived privacy back in a work environment where I can't get a second to myself, and for that I'd gladly shell out the asking price twice over."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-09-22,Noise Cancellation isn’t better - Update,"This is strictly about the noise cancellation. I went to the Bose store today and tested them side by side. The older QC35 took out more noise period. I was shocked. The store employee even confirmed that it’s possible... lol. The 700’s don’t have the you’re in a bubble effect feel at all. You can pretty much hear everything. They did feel great and are super light weight. The employee suggested I try them for 30 days... I don’t think I need to but I may just for the hell of it. Update: I had a chance to test out the Bose next to the Sony XM3, and wow. There is a huge difference. I repeated my test 4 times to make sure the Bose was working. In a side by side test in a noisy retail store, the Sony was clearly better at noise cancellation. I didn't test the sound quality. I also found the Sony's to be surprisingly comfortable although true comfort test would be wearing them for hours. Bottom line the Sony's are better at removing background noise. Shocking since the Bose was/is known for that."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-09-22,Did not meet expectations,"so I purchased these headphones and used them almost daily for two weeks. so here it is guys/galls:
Price: these are top dollar. after taxes, it was around 433.34
Build: this is the only thing I will give Bose a 5 in. these feel very well built and the are comfortable. Functions: the side functions, such as volume, pause, and skip song are glitchy and often not very responsive. its as if the headphones are not sure what the taps mean... and they are the ones who should know. App: no bugs, the app actually functioned well. Noise cancelation: Not much improvement and to be honest I found my older ones to be better with canceling noise. the Sony competitor is notably better (and noticeably cheaper lol). Sound: the headphones sound ""ok"", and that's the problem... for top dollar, the sony's should not be noticeably better, and they are. It's a very big disappointment for me because I love Bose products. these missed the mark. they sound very good when plugged into a computer or other device, but the cord is short and gets in the way. also, they do not include the air plain adaptor. must purchase separately. Over All: these headphones are just ""ok"" the Sonys are better in many ways, and I am returning my 700s for the Sonys. for the money you pay, the Bose 700s did not deliver."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-23,Worst customer experience of all time. $400 headphones that don't work!,"I initially purchased the Sony headphones, the ones that everyone says are the best NC headphones on the market. I was not disappointed in any way, other than the fact that I learned that the Sonys do not support multipoint device switching. My intention was to sit at my home office, and use the headphones interchangeably with my Mac and my iPhone, and to switch between them as needed. The Sonys do not do this, period. So I set out to research and find a pair that do. I reluctantly ponied up the extra money ($400) for the brand newly released Bose 700s. These were meant to be Bose's upgrade from its flagship Quiet Comfort 35 II as a response to the sleeker, better functioning Sony's. One of the touted features of the new Bose 700s is the multipoint device functioning and switching. It's supposed to be seamless switching from one device to another. The headphones arrived, and out of the box require you to download a Bose Music app and sign up for a Bose account. In fact, the only way to customize the headphones' settings is through the app. The app made it very easy to connect to first my iPhone, and the sound was fabulous. And they worked great, for music and for phone use. Then I connected to a second device, my Mac, and that's where everything went wrong. The sound stopped working on both devices entirely. Let me repeat -- when I connected to a second device on these ""multipoint headphones,"" no sound came out on either device. Worse, the headphone controls stopped working entirely. Amazingly, when I disconnected from my computer they began working again flawlessly with just my iPhone. I contacted support through Amazon, and Amazon immediately connected me to Bose by phone. I explained the problem, and within 3 minutes (no exaggeration), Bose offered to have me ship back the faulty pair and replace them with a new pair. The fast response without much troubleshooting indicated to me that Bose has fielded many calls like mine, and that probably some of their headphones ship with no problems at all and others have some irreparable problem like mine. I told them I was willing to give it one more try. They told me my new pair would ship within 7-10 days AFTER my old (brand new) pair made it back to Bose. Today I received the new Bose 700s, my second pair in two weeks. The exact same problems occurred as happened with the first pair. Upon connection to a second device, the headphones simply stop working on either device and the headset controls freeze up. I am returning them to Amazon, and literally will never try another Bose product again. This was the worst customer experience I've ever had, and on a supposed premium product that is sold for $400. I wouldn't buy these unless you're willing to roll the dice that you get a functioning pair, the price comes down significantly, or you are willing to have to spend hours playing around with this thing and calling various customer service departments. Utter waste - of time, of money, of trust."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-23,Amazing sound and noise cancelling quality,The quality of the sound and noise cancellation is amazing. Battery life is okay and could be better but other very satisfied with this purchase.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-24,Good product,Great product. Would’ve loved the noise cancellation to be a little more noticeable but all in all good headphones.
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-09-25,Great sound but...,The sound quality and comfort is what I expect from Bose. I dislike that I can't just pair with my device and have to use a Bose app.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-25,Love them,These worked great
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-09-26,Great headphones!,Great headphones been using them for about a week now and i have no problems so far! Only thing that I disliked is that you have to download the app for it to connect to your device
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-26,"Bose,,, you get what you pay for.","Expensive,,,, but I use them in a lot more places than an airplane,,,, good battery life,,, fantastic sound quality,,, TJXJ12."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-09-26,I tried most ANC headphones and so far.....,"..this is what I found...
OK - here's my background:
Owned:
Bose QC15
Bose QC25
Bose QC35
Sony MDR-1000MX3
Bower & Wilkens PX
Beats Studio 3
Highlights of this model (purchased from Bose store):
* Better noise cancellation than QC35 (which says a lot) - on par with Sony MX3 but they do differ
* Comfortable - more comfortable around base of neck with earcups up than QC25/35s - still comfortable when listening too - much more comfort than the Sony MX3
* Excellent phone call quality including mic pickup - noise cancelling even in phone audio! (Industry-first) (in contrast with the awful Sony ones)
* Touch controls that *actually* work <i'm looking at you SONY!>
* USB-C <welcome to the 21st century> - can use a phone/nintendo switch/laptop charger and fast charging
* excellent build quality - a tad better than the QC35 which says a lot
* non-descriptive Bose symbols on the sides of the cups
* Better sound quality in mids and even bass than the QC35s
* nicer thinner zip case
Cons:
* Ears will get hotter than QC35s - different earpad material used but keeps a better sound seal (same issue with the Sony MX3)
* No longer has the easy-to-find & control 'physical' control buttons
* Doesn't fold (but honestly, I don't miss it)
* new flat case doesn't zip/unzip easily (nitpicking)
* no airport plug adaptor included
* took a while to figure out controls (how to even turn it off/on - hint single-click of bluetooth button)
* ""manual"" just shows you to install app! * no aptX or HD encoding *still* (but music still sounds great)
Verdict: All Bose had to do is make a QC35 III with USB-C, aptX and incorporate these sound & ANC improvements and they would have WIPED THE FLOOR with the competition but fortunately for the competition, they didn't. Unless you want the very best Bose has on offer, I wouldn't upgrade to these if I owned the QC35 II. But for everyone else, it's worth the punt/cop."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-09-26,Can't connect to my phone anymore,"Literally have tried everything to pair these to my phone, I can't do it, it only connects to my laptop and that's it. Expensive trash, do not purchase."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-26,Great sound quality,Love it
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-26,EASE OF USE,IMPRESSIVE
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-26,IMHO,Very satisfied so far. Hopefully these won't have a glitche like the QC 35 ones did. They wouldn't shut off. ☹
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-26,Bose headset,Performs as expected.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-09-26,Airline adapter nice to be sold with the unit,"When you spend $350.00, you expect to get $5.00 airline adapter. And that was not included."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-27,high quality product that performs just as stated!,Love the comfort and sound! Use them on job sites and when driving a noisy work vehicle. These noise cancelers really work!! Thank you Bose !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-27,Quilty,Flight
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-27,Simply Awesome,"Exceptional Noise Cancelation, Sound Quality & East Setup! Worth Every Penny!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-27,These work as they should do. Good noise cancelling and good battery life,Originally had the Bluetooth issues that plagued iPhone and iPad but subsequent IOS updates fixed these and so far no more issues. Managed to use them on two trans Atlantic flights with the included cable. Best of all I can do my multiple conference calls. I
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-09-27,They’re “fine” but not worth the upgrade.,"So far it takes calls better, but that’s the only improvement over the QC 35 II. These feel slightly less well made than the previous flagship. Everything is mostly great and I don’t really have any major complaints."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-27,Best Headphones Ever!,The headline says it all :)
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-27,Best Noise cancelling headphones,Easily the best headphones I have owned
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-09-27,Disappointment,"The noise cancellation feature started working then ceased, the interface with the app failed repeatedly until it was not able to do anything with it. It feels cheap and lack of intelligence with the control on the right side. I absolutely do not see the point of $400-...besides it was obvious that it was a “return” from another customer by the way it can wrapped and that end up on me. This is the second time that I have to make a note for Amazon customer services or quality to pay attention."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-28,Comfort and sleekness,"Fantastic and it’s music or vocal sound ,only heard by the owner."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-28,(almost) Nothing can hear outside,I believe this one is worth for $399.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-28,Comfort and great quality sound,"I recently bought the Bose 700’s and the Sony wh1000xm3’s because I was going back and forth between the two. Most of the reviews I read online said that the Sony’s were the better but overall, but I kept coming back to the Bose. Yes, the sony’s Have an adjustable EQ in the app, but in my opinion the Sony app is too complicated for me. I prefer just powering on the Bose headphones and canceling out the world around me. To me, the Bose do a better job canceling out sound then the Sony’s. I also think the sound on the Bose is better, and the comfort on the 700s is perfect. Plus, they feel a lot more premium than the Sony’s. I can adjust the EQ in my music apps, so the headphones perform great. Overall, I’m very satisfied with my Bose headphones. They are expensive, but well worth it"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-28,Hidden gem,"I spent about 3 weeks choosing my next headphones and I ended up with Bose 700. My use case is a heavy music listener from classics to rock and DJ music, I frequently fly and take train to work, I often need to join conference calls while traveling. Noise Cancellation headphones is a necessity for me. Naturally, I was researching latest Sony MX3, Bose QC35 II and Bose 700. I ruled Sony out relatively fast due to requirement of phone calls and had to choose between 2 Bose options. Sony's mic is horrible. I went re-read many reviews on amazon with many mentioning 700 having issues with connection, mobile app and bad sound quality - specifically bass. Following recommendations I ordered QC35 II. Unexpectedly, Amazon had issues delivering these and I requested a refund. I thought it might be a sign from above... I stepped into the store and decided to try both pairs myself. After a short conversation with a seller pressured with the need to get a new pair I purchased Bose 700. Here are my observations after couple days of usage:
1. You don't have to use Bose app to use these. Just go to Bluetooth menu and add these. The app also works perfectly for me. 2. Noise Cancellation - I tested these right away on airplane and taxi. Works amazingly. 3. Connectivity issue - works with no issues. 4. Comfort - very comfortable. I can wear them for hours. 5. Fast charge / USB C - **must**. I charged for 15 min to get couple hours of listening. Amazing. I also can use my Macbook pro charger to charge these. Love it. 6. Sound Quality - I have to admit I miss the QC 35 II bass drive. However, these still sound like Bose. The sound is much cleaner - very transparent. I can distinguish every instrument in the orchestra while listening to the classical music. I test the speaker and saw that it is capable to produce amazing bass. When I put dance music the bass drive is very nice. I believe it is a matter of firmware upgrade to fix the issue. ** I hope Bose is reading these notes and can come up with an update. Equalizer would be an amazing to tweak our listening experience. **
7. Phone call quality is a treat for the business people. Don't think twice get this pair. The price difference is not that huge to think a lot. Note I'm just another buyer as most of you. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. I don't mind sharing my experience. I don't think pictures are necessary. There are plenty of pics / videos out there."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-28,Music sounds great. Other sounds gone!,I love these headphones. I no longer hear my loud roommate when she is on speaker phone and talking over a very loud TV. I bought these because I have to go to bed early for work. I couldn't fall asleep with all of the back ground noise. These head phones solve my problems. Looking forward to trying them out on a plane.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-09-29,Love the Bose NCL700,Great improvement from the already great QC 35 headphones. Sound and noise cancelling is fantastic.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-09-29,Well Worth the Purchase,"This is another great BOSE product. I fly about 100 flights a year so it’s important for me to have a reliable noise canceling headset. What I like most about this new series is the different levels of noise cancellation you can control from the headset. With two presses of a button, I can go from a level 10 (~90% noise blockage) to a level 0 (0% noise blocking) which is helpful once my flight is completed and I want to hear normally."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-09-29,Great hardware. Bose Music App lacks polish.,"Overall, this is a great headphone with amazing ANC (which was what I bought the headphones for). The Bose Music App felt more like beta software and lacks polish. Headphone has difficulty maintaining connection to the Bose Music App, and reconnecting interrupts music. Waited for as long as the Amazon return period before returning, and there was still no software update from Bose. Pros:
- Amazing ANC. - Solid build quality. - Comfortable. - Great sounding. Cons:
- Bose Music App lacks polish. Unable to hold connections. Reconnecting also fails multiple times before succeeding. Interrupts music upon reconnecting. Also need to sign up and login to use the App, not sure why. - Stays on my head well while looking down; tends to fall off while looking up (the ear cups would flip over). Also unable to wear while lying down for this same reason. - I would prefer more bass in the sub-bass range. I own other Bose products as well, such as Bose SoundSport earbuds. The other products also with ""Bose Signature"" sound has considerably more sub-bass than NC700. Overall, I really liked the Bose NC700. The deal breaker for me was the poor Bose Music App. I own other Bose products and the old Bose Connect App was fine. Not sure why they would switch to a new Bose Music App which clearly was not built with the same quality as the hardware itself."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-09-30,Motionless auto shut off,"The headphones have a motionless auto shut off feature that cannot be overridden or changed. If the headphones do not detect any motion for 10 minutes, they shut off. So forget about trying to sleep on a long flight somewhere. Not happening. If a fix for this feature doesn't go live soon, I will be returning the product."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-01,Love them!,Love these headphones!
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-01,Audio Cable Replacement,I misplaced the audio cable for my Bose 700s. Went to two Bose stores at the airport and they did not have a cable that would work. I had to connect Bose directly for a replacement cable. Bose charged me $27 for a cable with Shipping and Handling. What makes this cable so special...
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-01,Great Headphones,Great Headohones
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-10-01,Buggy software and does not auto reconnect.,"Noise cancellation: 2nd to none with 10 levels of control to allow in as much or as little of the outside world as you want. Sound quality: Crisp, clean, and level. True to source. Nuf said! Bass quality: Clean, true base not artificially enhanced. If you are looking for teeth rattling base, move along. Software and controls: This is where things fall apart. It does have software that is updateable so I am hopeful that Bose keeps improve the clunky software that is the only hindrance to my enjoyment of this otherwise best in class product. ° errors while initially pairing
° constant connection errors in trying to use the app provided for advanced controls
(even while connected and actively listening to that device)
° if disconnection happens due to distance from source you need to manually reconnect
° touch control for volume, stop, play, skip is next to unuseable. Very hit and miss. ° unpredictable behaviour when connecting to multiple sources
(I use the BT5 multi input with both laptop and phone. Quite handy when it works but adds complexity that Bose has not mastered yet)
° Software app layout is 50% product picture and 50% useless when it does connect. Besides going in initially to set up the advanced options (The product will work fine without the app and seamingly forced registration but you will be stuck with defaults although the default settings are 100% doable) I only use the app to connect to change an occasional default setting and hope they are going to update the firmware on the headset to fix the buggs. I know that it is possible upgrade the firmware to in the headset to get rid of all the connection issues, so I hope they do. I have a BT5 headset that is 10% the cost that I never have to worry about it connecting/reconnecting even with multiple sources.... unfortunately not noise cancelling or near the sound quality or I would be return these immediately."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-10-02,Perfect for commuters and frequent flyers,"These are an absolute joy on the loud subways of the city. It's made my commute much more relaxing and serene. The headphones have a relatively flat response curve which is what I like. If you are looking for a lot of bass these may not be for you. What these will provide is an accurate and clear sound across lows, mids and high. The battery life is less than competitive with similar headphones from competition but the noise cancelling is second to none. The audio quality is very strong for the price point but are not as clear or well rounded as sennheiser hd650s. These are great out and about headphones that will satisfy an audiophile but they will not replace a pair of open back headphones for at home listening for the more selective listeners out there"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-02,design,great design，thats enough
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-10-04,"Amazing noise cancelling, prioritized look over function for some things.","What I like:
- The noise cancelling lives up to the hype. - Voice noise cancelling is amazing and worlds above the QC35 II. What I don't like
- They prioritized appearance over function.Many of the functions involve swiping or tapping, which sometimes simply doesn't work or unintentional things happen if you rest them around your neck."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-10-04,You could do worse - for any amount of money.,"A decent ""4,"" not a ""4+"" or a ""5."" After reading many reviews, I didn't bother downloading the app. You don't need it to use the headphones and the adjustments you make won't matter very much. I verified this using borrowed new Bose 700 headphones from two friends. Moving on, like headphones I've been using with the 1970s, this are, well, headphones. These don't require hardwires - a real plus. They immediately sound better just because you're closer to your sound - and blocking out SOME sound you don't want. They eventually get hot, feel heavy, get in the way of napping... They all do... It's a thing attached to your head... Duh. A matter of ""when,"" not ""if."" The touch controls are simple, but it is annoying to keep being told the battery level. Maybe a ""triple-tap, triple-tap"" for that info.? Otherwise, the buttons and touch controls work better than others I've used. Simple, works... Having to read the manual on-line was just a stupid move. FFS, at least include a mini-disc, usb stick, or a big piece of paper with words and pics - not everybody has immediate access to the Internet when they open the box. Anyway... Not much different from most headphones, really. A bit nicer, maybe much nicer, all around, but still pretty much a ""headphone"" experience. The noise cancelling is better than most, but all of them are a bit weird about ""representing"" sounds using a pickup mic to do so. So, this is where we are, still... You can't seem to buy ANYTHING to block out other people's yakking, loud waiting room TVs, passing trucks. Hm. Thinking I might go to earbuds with shooting muffs over them. Same result - not as pretty. Oh, well... You do what you gotta do. These are good, none of these are truly, ""Great!"" So... 4... Which is pretty good. Most don't rate above a 3... Or, even a 2..."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-04,Dont waste your money!,"Worst experience ever. Headphones came defective and were shipped back to Bose. A month later still no headphones. I have a pair of the original Bose that were great, but will never buy Bose again after this kind of servce."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-05,Amazing headphones,Owned the Q35 II before these and these are a much better upgrade. Don't buy into having to use the Bose app because you don't. You can use them on your phone and computer as normal.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-10-06,Un Bose muy malo,Sonido muy débil no tiene bajo de verdad no valió la pena comprarlo muy triste
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-06,App download [and privacy policy] required - headphones won't work otherwise,"Bose forces you to download an app and agree to their invasive privacy policy. Why? Who knows. Innocuously, it's likely to track your listening habits. Worst case scenario it's to put a microphone in your home and listen to your conversations. Likely not intentionally, but considering how bad Bose is at software, there's almost a non-zero chance that the security of their app is secure. Imagine a rogue Bose employee or hacker compromising your hardware through the Bose app.... This was the easiest return of my life."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-07,"wonderful sound, noise cancellation, and overall quality.","I love these. I work from home doing online teaching and design. I'm easily distracted and have young kids. I also am really noise-sensitive. These have become my daily friend. For some reason getting them setup initially was difficult, so I suggest going step by step in the manual. Once done, though, it has been a breeze reconnecting. I have an android phone and a Windows 10 PC. Both connect at once, with the Alexa access coming through my phone. The sound is really great, of course, and the noise canceling is top notch. I can't even tell it's on, really, just everything is quieter. The sound is such that when I turn it on, I sometimes can't tell if my headphones are connected and I'm hearing clear sound from my speakers. It feels so natural and simply ""there."" Alexa integration is smooth and it's like bringing an echo everywhere ( as long as your phone is accessible). Great for work or chores or just about anything since they're lightweight (I wear them for long stretches throughout the day). I'm not typically on the Bose bandwagon, but I have another set of Jabra headphones that I really liked before that I'm not really using as much now. These just do everything better."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-07,Impresionante,Excelente producto
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-10-07,"If you use for work and Zoom calls, you will be disappointed as they disconnect",I want to use these for work but these continue to disconnect automatically from my Zoom calls. It seems to be a known issue. I have seen other complaints online.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-08,Dont buy,Dont buy if you intend to sleep with these. They shut off in 1 hr. Very pointless and no firmwear update.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-09,Not at ALL worth the price,"My last review has mysteriously disappeared. I initially gave these 3 stars, but I'm downgrading. The connection issues are endless. Mine sound like crap on phone calls, so I just use my AirPods. Unfortunately it's too late to return these or I would. They're not remotely worth the price tag. You have to keep your connected device practically on top of you, and I just spent twenty minutes trying to get them to pair with my iPhone yet again. It's ludicrous that you have to use their app. This is my third pair of Bose headphones and they're the worst of the bunch. I can't believe I wasted $400. Never again."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-10-10,"Bose, what happened? Dont waste your money","Tested various songs through the headset. The sound quality is terrible. It misses half of the instruments in a song. Listening to any electronic, or heavy instrumental music is near impossible. The sound sounds muffled the whole time, which is a contributing factor to the lack of instruments heard. The noise cancellation is average, the QCs provide better sound quality and noise cancellation. It's like Bose forgot how to make music. The speakers on my iPhone 11 Pro sound much better than these, night and day difference. There is no audio range. I feel like I've gone deaf listening to music with these headphones. I will say this product is good for listening to TV shows. But that's it. Very difficult to listen to music. Isn't that the point of headphones, listening to music? Instant Return, gonna pick up those new Sony headphones. Bose, what happened? Did you forget how to make headphones? The king has been dethroned!"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-11,Auto Shut-off Feature is a Deal Breaker,"First, the good: Noise Cancellation is excellent. I can make calls in a noisy room and the person on the other end of the phone can hear my clearly. The bad: The headphones have a feature that turns off the power if it senses no movement after 10 minutes. This is a serious problem for those who fall asleep or meditate with their headphones on. This is exasperated by the fact that the shutdown sound is so loud that it wakes me up. It's a complete deal breaker for me and I'm returning the headphones. There is a thread on the Bose website of others who have complained about this issue. The Bose moderator has given no reassurance that this issue will be fixed by a firmware update in the near future. There are a lot of frustrated users on the forum."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-10-12,"TLDR: previous generation are better qc25, qc35","Just ran back to back comparisions with QC35 and 700 in airport. I own the QC25s. Cons for 700: heavy, narrow band presses down on top of head, cushions stiffer and less comfortable. I could not wear these for long periods, they would be uncomfortable. App sucks hard. Forcing customers to setup an account for headphones is ridiculous, major fail. Pros: very good noise cancellation, better than QC35 or 25s. Sounds compressed but overall slightly better sound quality than QC35 for jazz, classical, balanced listening. Better than the new Sony noise cancelling phones. I would have bought them if they were better but they are not so I kept my $ in my pocket."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-13,Good but not for outside,"The sound quality was great. I work outside and the wind noise was deafening to the point I would get a headache. Bought the older version that I used to have, problem solved"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-13,really cool,its look is so fancy n cool. I love it
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-13,Kid approved,My kid paid for them himself and loves them.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-10-13,Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I'm a huge Bose fan. For me they are superior headphones and earphones. I love the sound of the noise cancelling headphones. The quality of the sound is top notch. The bass is booming. I did not like that I had to download the Bose app to my iPhone in order to use the headphones. Connecting to my phone's Bluetooth should be enough. If you're person who has a large head, the headphones will fit tight and it can get uncomfortable when wearing them for a long period of time. I used them during a 4 hour flight and 2 hours into the flight, I had to switch over to earbuds. But all in all, another great product from Bose. I wouldn't expect anything less."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-14,iPHONE call quality NOT acceptable,"I have had so many problems with these 700 headphones, it's ashame Bose is not producing a better product out the door. The BOSE APP IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND SHOULD BE REMOVED. The team that created that app should be complete replaced. App CONSTANTLY DISCONNECTS from my iphone 7 and now form my new iphone 11. the headphones will automatically connect to devices on the other side of the house and start playing someone elses music???? Crazy bad situation. I actually bought these because I needed to talk to client on the phone. The bluetooth connection is so spotty that 70% of the calls sounded intermittent, and the audio would constantly cut out. Unusable for client/work use. Finally, I guess I thougth Noise ""Cancelling"" meant the noise and outside sounds wouldbe 'cancelled'. Not even close. Maybe my expectation were wrong when they called these headerphones 'cancelling' instead of Noise Dampening. In a standard starbucks coffee shop, the noise was dampened (setting = 10) but it was certainly not remotely quiet in the headphones. You could hear all voices and all music easily."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-14,These Are State of the Art!,"No cons, all pros."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-14,Great sound quality!,Great product! !
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-14,Internal electrical problems,A week after I got the head phones they started playing a crackling noise though the Mic that has not stopped.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-15,not strong enough,not strong enough
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-15,Bose headphones,"As expected Bose high-quality
They are certainly pricey
I think they’re worth it"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-16,Worth the price,Like the new design. The new touch pad makes it easier to use. It's worth the money in my humble opinion. 𝗦𝗞𝗢𝗟
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-10-16,Bad microphone noise cancellation,"The microphone does not buffer noise around. It actually amplifies the background noise, making it very noisy for folks listening to what the mic captures. Disappointing for me as I work on an opened space environment."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-16,Trifecta!,"Ya, perfect headphones. That makes it sound simple, or like there are other options. You must understand what kind of rare combination this is. To use this at work there are three features needed:
1- Noise Cancelling: There is a lot of noise around me. I need to be able to focus on my work and also need to hear my calls without straining over the noise around me. 2- Microphone Background Noise: I call a lot of clients and with the noise around me I need the microphone to cancel out everything except my voice. 3- Comfort: I hate 'work' headsets for comfort. I want a comfortable set of headphones for wearing all day long. That tri-fecta is SO HARD to find. It is easy to find headphones with good noise cancelling that are comfortable. Those two are easy to find together. It is also easy to find headsets that can cancel background noise for the microphone. Some are even comfortable but none of them have great noise cancelling or even let me play music. Getting all three? So, very, hard. Lastly, since you can assume Bose has great noise cancelling and comfort I just want to illustrate the microphone. We ordered 13 high-end bluetooth and wired headphones and tested out the mic with a lot of background noise. Not many did anything for the noise. A few did a little, but you still have to ask people to be quiet. Bose WIPES IT OUT. Laughing, chatting, singing... all gone. I often ask, ""Sorry if you can hear that noise"" and almost always get, ""Oh, I couldn't hear anything"" from my clients. It is amazing! I am using a macbook... pc users next me have not had the same luck :("
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-18,USB-C Charing is a gamechanger,"The Bad
I have one gripe. I didn't like having to create a Bose account to get started with my headphones. I felt like the default Bose settings are pretty good and I didn't really need that customizability to start with. This is reasonably forgivable because this cost you a few moments in many hours of operation. However, I rarely use the app to toggle settings because you have to put it in pairing mode to connect your phone and that's enough of a barrier. The Good
- USB-C charging is awesome. If you have usb-c charged computer and/or phone, it reduces the cables you need to bring traveling. AND the charging is fast! Some mornings, I realize right before heading to work that my headphones are low battery, I just plug in for 3-5 minutes and I have enough to get me through the commute. It's spec'd at 15 minutes to charge 2 hours. - You can make phone calls with it! Previously, I would carry around another set of headphones for conference calls. 0 actually amplifies the sound around you aka your voice. - Noise cancelling is about the same as the previous too, these fit comfortably and firmly on my ear so I think even if the headphone is off, there is less noice compared to the QC15"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-19,"Less comfortable, but great","Amazing product, always wanted to have a pair of those since I broke my Bose QC35. Like it so much, starting from design to the ANC, but one thing is worse than QC35s, this one is less comfortable for my ears(("
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-19,Tre53tr3,😋s
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-19,Minor changes mean the best keeps getting better. USB-C and new headband design are key features,"I've owned every iteration of the Bose noise canceling headphones over the years and I think they are almost perfect and can't get better, but every generation seems to add just enough for me to really appreciate the improvements. This year is no different. Having used the 700's for several months, I'm convinced that Bose has again made the best even better with subtle tweaks and refinements. I use the Bose everyday and all day working in a cubicle and they completely cut out the world around me and allow me to focus on my coding. Our office uses computer based video/audio conference and I use these every day for meetings and calls at my desk and they allow me to hear better and follow along. I don't even bother going to conference rooms anymore because the sound and video is worse in them than using my Bose and my monitor. I also make cross country flights 6-8 times a year and can't imagine flying without Bose headphones ever again. The new multiple levels of noise cancellation on the 700s is handy for those few times where I want to be able to hear folks trying to get my attention but most of the time I leave them on max mode. I'm able to have them simultaneously paired with my iMac and my iPhone and the switching is seamless between which ever is playing sound. This still has the occasional problem of not switching but works well 90% of the time. The new touch controls allow you to swipe and control volume, however they can also result in false triggers when you are trying to adjust them or take them on or off your head. You just need to learn to hold them on the edges to avoid this. The headphone band is new and no longer hinges in the middle, instead the cups rotate to lay flat in the case. This results in a slightly larger footprint in the case but it's less of an orgami puzzle to pack/unpack them when you're on the plane. The Bose AR stuff is fun for the first time you try it, but it's kind of a gimmick and after experiencing it once I never played with it again. Battery life is on par with the QC35-II. Weirdly the voice prompts now give you battery life in hours instead of percentage. I guess that's a better measure but coming from many years of the percentage prompts it's an adjustment. Perhaps my favorite feature is the switch to USB-C for charging. I'm almost entirely free of Micro-USB from my life when I travel and good riddance. One unexpected feature was that the headphones seem to sense when they are on your head and if you take them off and put them on the desk for more than a few mins, they will power off to save battery. This has saved me numerous times from dead batteries when I took them off without remembering to power them off. If you already own the QC35-II, then it's hard to justify the upgrade, but if you are looking to get into the Bose from the start, I think the $50 premium over the QC35-II makes this worth it. Pros:
- New USB-C charging (goodbye microUSB.. nobody has time for you)
- Hinge free headband that just feels solid
- Multiple noise cancellation levels
- Voice assistant support can't be really useful
- Fantastic voice and sound support for audio/video calls
- Auto power off if they are not on your head
Cons:
- Still pricey but they will last you for years and hold their resale value if you take care of them
- Bose AR isn't very useful aside from a technology demo"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-20,Great,"Sounds great, Bluetooth connects very quickly talking to someone sounds really good! Very light weight.."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-20,Turn off Automatically while trying to sleep! Not fixable as of yet!,"There is a major flaw with this model with no update from Bose in their Community forum in months. They automatically shut off after 10 minutes if they are not moved or if you are asleep or trying to meditate. Many of us have returned them until they fix this issue. Beware this has to do with their gyro Which overrides the app where you have the option of timing it to go off or stay on. They go off with a very a loud sound and turn off by them selves if you are napping, meditating, or sleeping on a plane. For many of us, they are worthless! Beware!"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-20,Auto Off Feature Prevents You from Sleeping,"Want to fall asleep with these on in the plane or on a train? Forget it. Bose has an auto-off feature that you can't turn off. If there is no movement for 10 minutes, a very loud audible will let you know about it just prior to it turning off. Bose calls this a feature because it's designed to turn off in the event you accidentally leave them on... I guess Bose didn't think about someone possibly not moving for 10 minutes when sleeping on a plane or train or in bed, etc..."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-21,Great Cans!,Much better phone call quality over the QC 35's. Very happy with these cans.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-10-21,Don’t buy. It’s clear Bose rushed this product in response to Sony,"I spent hours online trying to figure out which headphones to get. My QC-35s were expensive but worth it (lasted over 7 years). Now in the age of wireless, I figured it was time for an upgrade. All the YouTubers said the 700s were great, but they personally chose the Sony for the better audio quality. For business, many people said the 700s were better for the microphone quality. It’s also nice that you can connect two devices at once (phone and laptop)
Let me just save you time:
- The microphone quality works great, only when you are talking on the phone
- If you record something in Audacity (for HD sound) it sounds like you are calling in on a 1998 Nokia cell phone
- Bose support had no troubleshooting steps other than testing it on multiple devices and letting the engineering team know (so it’s obviously a known issue if they didn’t offer to replace)
- The multiple devices is awesome until your phone call disconnects from your headset for no reason
The software is terrible and too broken have a chance. I’m boxing these up with a smile on my face to get my money back. Bose totally dropped the ball on this one."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-21,The Future of Bose Headphones,"I have owned Bose's QC15 for 4 years and I decided that it was about time to upgrade to a different Bose Headphone especially since those headphones started cutting out when the volume was really loud. The QC15s were exceptional. My first impression of Bose's NC 700 was that it looks like the Apple product that Apple Never released. It looked sleek, slim, simple, elegant, and professional at the same time. They look beautiful. They are very light, lighter than I expected in terms of weight. Its made from durable material that does not seem cheap or plasticky. The ear pads are very soft leather, but they are not very padded. I would have preferred a thicker pad that had better insulation and better fit. The Earcups and the fit can be adjusted by sliding then up or down. I can see this becoming loose over time and usage (I hope not). The leather headband is not very cushiony, but it is comfortable for my head. The headphones can only be folded flat like the picture above, which makes them fit in the provided leather carrying case. Also included in the Carrying case is a little magnetic flap that houses the USB C charging cable and the 3.5mm Cable. The Headphones sound great, but they are not mind-blowing. They sound very similar to my QC15s, but my QC15s are surprisingly louder and more balanced. The Bose pair offers the best Bass in a Bose Headphone so far. I have been through 3 pairs of NC 700s (1 Black, and 2 Soapstone/Rose Gold. My First Pair (The Black Ones) were lacking in terms of crispness and loudness. I was a little disappointed when I was listening to Music on Spotify or watching a Movie on Netflix (Paired to my MacBook), I felt like the sound was a little far. However, my Second Pair, the Soapstone/Rose Gold NC 700 Headphones, they did not have that issue, but they a different issue where the sound was not balanced on both Ear Cups/Drivers, in which it was quieter on the left Earcup. We compared the headphones to the ones on Display at the Bose Store, and we realized that something was not right with them. I am not sure if it was a manufacturing issue or a hardware defect or a software defect. The Third pair had a similar thing, but it was very minimal. The sound is still somewhat balanced toward the Right Earcup. We tested 3 Different iPhones, a MacBook, and a Samsung phone, in order to make sure that it was not a phone issue. We also made sure that the phones' settings had the sound balanced to the middle. I have very sensitive hearing and I notice minimal differences and discrepancies in sound, but I do not think that this would be an issue for anyone else. I hope that this could be something that could be fixed through some kind of Firmware update in the future through the inclusion of more customizations such as balancing sound, Equalizers (EQ), and other settings. The Bose Music App is a step backward in terms of innovation in which it prevents you from making any setting changes to the headphones themselves other than the Levels of Noise Cancelling, Conversation Mode, and Bluetooth Connections. The App has a Beautiful UI, but the requirement to register/Sign in and have a Wi-Fi/Data Connection to use it, is a big issue. Having a simple looking App is not really a good thing when the App could offer many customizations and access to the headphone's capabilities. The App is fast, easy to use, and allows you to connect more than 3 devices to your headphones at the same time, which is very convenient. I hope that the developers decided to allow more customization settings for the headphones. The Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) of the NC 700 is unparalleled and is the best thing about this pair of headphones. The App allows you to change the Noise Cancellation level to 11 different levels from 0 to 10. The headphone also comes with preset levels of 0, 5, and 10. The Headphones allow in some ambient sound and sounds from around you such as People talking, but its very minimum. The headphones also has a Conversation Mode. The headphones would have better ANC with thicker EarPads, I hope that Bose starts offering a Thicker set of EarPads in the future. The Current Earpads are not very tight where the headphones could move or even fall off of your head if you move your head. The clamping force of the headphones is not very strong, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Good thing in terms of comfort, but a bad thing in terms of keeping the headphones stay still. The Headphones offers somewhere between 20 and 22 hours of Charge/Music Play (Depending on your NoiseCancelling Settings and your volume level). I found that the NC 700s offer fast charging which is very convenient along with the inclusion of the USB C. I can't comment on the Voice Assistants because I have never used it, and I probably will not need to. The Touch pad/EarCups is nice, but it is very sensitive, which could be a little annoying if you accidentally touch it or if you if you're wearing a hoodie that touches it as you're moving, which causes it to pause. Rain could also be an issue with the touch feature, but I would not recommend using something that could get water damaged in the rain. Overall, I am happy with my Purchase so far. The headphones offer great sound, exceptional unparalleled NoiseCancelling, and a very Aesthetically pleasing design. It offers a lot of upgrades and improvements over the previous headphones, but it also has room for improvement especially firmware and software wise. Bose's AR could have potential in the future, but it could turn out to be a gimmick that no one uses or adopts. The Bose Developes/Sound Engineers need to open up the Sound customizations for this headphone though their Music App. That is the only thing that is holding this back. I believe that overtime, more issues will be fixed through Firmware updates if Bose is committed enough to find and fix all of the non hardware issues. Only time will tell how these headphones will hold up and if they would last as long as my other pair. I will Update this Review later depending on what happens in the future and depending on my experience. I hope that someone would this review somewhat helpful."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-22,HORRIBLE Bose Customer Service,"I purchased a pair of Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 (For the rest of this review, I will abbreviate this as either ""NCH 700s"" and/or simply ""700s""), which arrived in two days. The 700s replaced my QC 35 Is out of impulse. I severely regret the impulse. Here's the good:
1. USB-C charging
2. Design aesthetic
3. Changing noise isolation levels
Here's the bad:
1. Constant static crackling, even when only connected to one device
2. The form factor is a lot larger and less compact than prior models, making it an awkward travel companion
Here's the unacceptable, which has turned me off Bose for the rest of my life:
1. The replacement process is atrocious. On 9/30/2019, I reached out to Bose and got in touch with Mitzi, who set up an RMA process for my defective headphones. I asked about an expedited replacement where Bose could place a hold on my credit card for the amount of a replacement pair so that my downtime would be minimal, but Bose refused to offer this as an option. Mitzi assured me that Bose would send my replacement headphones with 2-day expedited shipping once UPS was in possession of the item. On 10/2/2019, I reached out to Bose again to ask about the status of my return label. It turns out that Bose never sent the return label, and had to generate one for me. On 10/3/2019 I dropped off the headphones at UPS. For the next six days, they were not marked as in transit by UPS. On 10/9/2019, UPS finally made movement on the headphones. Bose did not ship their replacement unit as promised. On 10/16/2019, UPS finally delivered the headphones to Bose. Bose did not confirm receipt nor ship their replacement unit as promised. On 10/18/2019, Bose assured me that my replacement unit would go out that day as an overnight delivery. It did not. On 10/22/2019, Bose finally provided me with the tracking number for a replacement unit which was marked as UPS Ground. Bose refused to ship the device in any faster method. As of the time of this review, the tracking number has made zero progress -- it was merely generated, no package was physically fulfilled. When buying a pair of NCH 700s, ask yourself: If (when) you get a defective unit, is this the kind of experience you want to have?"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-10-23,Wish they worked as well as the QC35's,"So I have used the QC35, Sony WF1000-XM3, Sony WH1000-XM3, and I really wanted to like the Bose 700's but they need to fix the bluetooth issues. Let me describe them first, and then I will get into the issue. Overall the headphones, feel and sound great. The ANC is pretty darn good. I played a demo model at the store before I bought them. I was a little apprehensive about the fact that they didnt fold, but the new design is much thinner so I got over that too. The Issue they need to fix:
Seems like something is screwed up with Bluetooth, as I am listening they just cut out, the phone is 6"" away from the headset. The iphone recognizes it went away since it stops the audiobook, and sometime I can hit play and it starts again, other times I have to turn them off, and back on. Its just a big hassle, and usually it happens right when the audiobook is getting good, so it makes it even more aggravating. Once they fix the bluetooth issue, these are awesome headphones, but until then they are completely unusable."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-23,"Hell is other people, and nobody shuts them up more effectively than Bose.”","Level 0 is what other ANC manufacturers often call ambient listening or hear-through mode, but here it's far more natural than any other ambient mode we've tested. The mics pick up your surroundings quite well and the levels are adjusted to match reality to an impressive degree. This means there's very little difference between what your surroundings sound like with the headphones on and in ANC level 0, and what they sound like without the headphones at all."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-23,Poor Sound Quality,Poor Sound Quality - The only reason I purchase bose.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-24,Awesoome,Amazing
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-24,Bose is top quality,Excellent product what I was looking for Bose products are always top quality. 👍
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-26,Amazing headset!,"They work so well, especially on the plane where your need to drown out the noise around you. I highly recommend them!"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-10-26,"So good, could not hear my car engine.",Am I driving a Tesla? No just wearing Bose 700's which easily cancel out my V8.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-26,"Privacy Violating, Nonstandard, irritating headphones","Touch sensitive ear cups are irritating and constantly cause issues. Requiring an app that violates your security and privacy should be a nonstarter for everyone, but for some reason people don't mind sending all of their most private information to bose. 2.5 mm connections when the world uses 3.5 is also a nonstarter. Don't know why people have to constantly create new designs that make things harder to use. Nobody wants fake ""augmented reality"" lies or unnecessary applications on our mobile devices or invisible buttons. Just a pair of headphones with good noise reduction that can listen to music."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-29,Wonderful product.,Hubby says they are the best.
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-10-29,"Decent but some annoying flaws, not worth the money","Pros:
- noise canceling is way better than my old QC25
- sound is pleasantly neutral with a great soundstage
- they look cool
Cons:
- those buttons on the side of the headphones. They press so easily that you frequently press them by accident. And by “frequently”, I mean multiple times a day. You can’t hand someone else the headphones to listen to a song, because they will almost 100% either accidentally turn off the headphones, or activate Siri. - the touch controls on the headphones are gimmicky and frequently activate on accident as well
I don’t understand how these issues made it past quality control. These headphones feel like a reactive attempt by Bose to be “hip” and “premium”. I ended up sending them back and will get the AirPod Pro"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-30,Awesome pair of ANC headphones,"I tested both these and the Sony xm3. The Sony sounded a bit better in my opinion but the mic on the Sony was awful. I couldn't use it for a call even in a quiet room. The mics on the Bose, on the other hand, sound amazing even in a loud coffee shop. This is also quickly apparent if you activate the noise pass through on each set. The Bose sounds like you don't have anything on and the Sony sound all echo-ey and awful. Again a symptom of terrible mic(s)
I found the noise cancelling on both to be equivalent and generally indistinguishable in all environments I tested (airplane, airport, mostly quiet house, coffee shop). Finally, having multi point Bluetooth is really nice as I almost always have my phone and either my iPad pro or laptop connected at the same time. The app is complete garbage but I never really use it once set up. It rarely connects properly. Comfort is equivalent to the xm3 and styling is subjective. I prefer the xm3 flatter look. Can't go wrong with either, but the deciding factor for me was the mic system."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-30,Does what it says,Use the headphones of plane flights. Much quieter. Comfortable enough for international flights. Pricey but I would recommend them.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-30,Great,"They feel a bit fragile compared to the QC35s. These aren't foldable but even the everyday use of sliding to earcups up and down worries me a bit. I dropped them once while adjusting the fit outside and the plastic casing got a bit chipped, which wouldn't have happened as badly with the QC35s. Other than that they're great."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-30,Ultimate headphones for business travelers,"If you want to skip my review then just read this. If you are a road warrior don't hesitate. BUY THESE HEADPHONES. I am very much a DIYer especially when it comes to home audio. This I would NEVER waste money on a speaker system from BOSE. I can taylor something far better for a space for less money than any Bose system. So spending $400 on a pair of headphones? No way. However, two months ago I was watching a Mark Robert video on YouTube and he took 5 minutes to do a plug on these headphones. He has always seemed like a very genuine guy but even I was a little skeptical of what he showed. He was using the headphones to take a phone call while leaf blowing. He recorded the audio from the other side of the line to showcase the person he was talking to couldn't hear the leaf blower at all. I was dumb founded and wanted to try it for myself. I travel 30 to 40 weeks out of the year. I'm constantly taking conference calls from busy restaurants and airports. Let alone can I not hear anything, the folks on the other side of the line can't hear me either. Then of course in annoying everyone in the space I'm in because I talk loudly to try and make up for it. The Bose 700s fix ALL OF THIS. My first try was in front of a bus stop at a busy airport. Waiting for a bus shuttle I took a conference call that I had to do a lot of talking on. The first thing I noticed is the noise cancelling let a little noise in. This allowed me to hear myself normally so I don't talk too loudly and disturb those around me. Next I could hear everyone on the call perfectly. Finally everyone on the call could hear me and hear none of the background noise. Literally nothing. They were shocked at the end of the call when I asked them how I sounded and they assumed I was at home in my office. I told them that in that time busses were whizzing by and people were yelling about which bus had arrived... They couldn't believe it. For that reason alone it is the best Bluetooth headset on the market. Now does it have the best noise cancellation? I think it could be better, but it's pretty near perfect. Other than really loud noises or high pitched sounds everything is blocked out. In fact I'm usually afraid I will fall asleep on the bus I take to the airport and miss my stop. The sound quality is fantastic and the battery life is great. I was worried seeing there are other brands offering 30 to 40 hours. I usually always have 10+ hours left after I get home from my trip and that's with no charging in between. Finally the controls are super intuitive. I was worried at first. These touch controls are always a gimmick. Then the amount of buttons on it too I was worried I wouldnt be able to figure it out and I would just never use the controls. In two days I had it down perfectly. Being able to easily skip tracks, turn down volume, pause music, and turn off noise cancelling is super useful. I'm sure you can find better head phones for music, better head phones for noise cancelling, or ones with better battery life. I guarantee you will not find ones better for taking phone calls that give you this incredible of an experience on top of it. These are clearly the best all around head phones and worth every penny."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-31,Top of the line,Incredible quality
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-31,Not a good product at the moment.,The headphones power off much too quickly. Drop blu-tooth easily.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-10-31,wind noise is a deal breaker,"The previous QC35ii does an excellent job of screening out wind noise when noise cancelling is set to ""low"", but for some reason the 700 has a serious problem with this at any noise cancelling setting. I find them unusable with wind or any other sustained air movement like indoors with a fan. I will most likely be returning these."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-10-31,"Great noise cancellation, really poor music quality and battery life.","I didn't just dislike the headphones, I hated them! I just got them 2 days ago and tried them twice. The first issue is very subjective and totally on me - I dislike the style (who knew!) of over-the-head headphones. But I think I could get used to that. What I can't get used to is the sound - it's awful. I'm coming from Apple Airpods so I expected a significant improvement in the sound quality with the Bose. On the contrary, it's worse. The sound is flat, almost ""muddy"". I'm far from an audiophile believe me, but this was just BAD. The noise cancellation is very good at least. When set to 10, I could not hear anything other than the (poor quality sound) music. That is a little disconcerting when people walk up beside you and you had no idea they were even there, but that is just the device doing its job. The app is handy but one thing it showed me was the battery draining very rapidly while wearing and using them for just 30 minutes. Maybe I got a bad one, but these are going back to the store today. I'm going to try the Apple Airpod Pro instead."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-31,Comfortable,"Can wear all day long, anc works just perfectly."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-10-31,Excellent Product. A bit Expensive.,Loved it for sound clarity and noise cancelling for taking phone calls in noisy locations.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-01,A great product with amazing noise cancelling for phone calls,"Love this product. Great sound quality and noise cancelling you expect from Bose. I upgraded from the QC35's, and the big difference has been the sound quality of my phone calls. I take a train to work every day, and I'm able to have conversations on my commute and they hear me perfectly. Well built, great product, highly recommend!"
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-11-01,Will not connect to Windows via Bluetooth,"I had a very common problem in that they wouldn't connect to my Windows PC via Bluetooth, which was the whole reason I bought this model. Many people had the same problem as me, and Bose support never had an answer for them. I even tried a new Bluetooth dongle, and that didn't work either. I'd think it was my problem, but I found the same thing online many times. Bottom line, if you're buying these to use on a PC via Bluetooth, go with another brand."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-01,"Great Bose quality, next-gen feel","Great product! All that I learned to love from my old QC 25s, but with even better sound quality and interface. The design is a fresh update and - though I've only had them for a bit - they look like they'll last a lifetime"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-01,It's really the best ANC headphone in the planet!,I have a QC35 for 2 years. I got this one from my friend. It's so good that I really like it.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-02,Bought at Bose Nebraska Crossing Outlets,"By far the best sound from any headphones I have ever owned; especially, smooth and clear during calls, while all music and movies sound better."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-11-02,Noise canceling not working while wired,"I’ve been using a Bose QC25 for over 3 years and it was time for an upgrade and to finally lose the wire! The QC700 works perfectly while connected to Bluetooth, didn’t have any issue with this. But when I wired the headphones to the plane’s entertainment system, the noise canceling stops immediately and there is no way to get it to work until you disconnect the wire and go with Bluetooth again. I use the headphones mostly on airplanes so this is a huge issue for me if I want to watch a movie and still have the noise canceling function. The sound quality is very good but didn’t notice any major difference with the QC25. Another annoying thing is the placement of the power/Bluetooth as well as noise canceling level buttons. Each time you want to adjust the headphones on your head you either turn off the Bluetooth or change the noise canceling level. Finally I don’t find any advantage in being able to adjust the noise canceling level from 0 to 10. I either want it off or fully on to mute as much as possible the outside noise. For $400+ with taxes I’m very disappointed in the product and just asked for a refund. I’m going back to my 3 years old QC25 that still works perfectly and never let me down."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-02,Amazing product from Bose.,"I don't have a long review or anything but this is a great product. Great noise cancellation, great sound, and looks and feels great as well. I much preferred the Bose 700 over the Sony WH-1000 XM3s, but it is a matter of personal preference. I thought the Bose felt like a more premium product and the sound was not muddy like the Sonys."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-03,gooood,goood😻
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-11-03,Not as versatile as QC-30,"I have now had a pair of QC-20s, three sets of QC-30s, and this set. It's a great pair of headphones, particularly if you only want to listen to music. My own use case is more complicated though; I want to use them for calls (generally work conference calls) and occasional music (usually when a plane is taking off or landing). These really aren't acceptable for phone calls. Apparently I'm really garbled when I'm trying to talk on the phone with them, even in relatively quiet environments (e.g. hotel rooms). They're also just....really big. Every cubic inch and every ounce counts in my travel bag, and the QC-30 are just better that way. So if you value phone usage, get those instead."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-11-04,Long-time Bose Customer / Very Disappointed.,"I have been in love with my QC-15 headphones since the year they were released. After many years of impressive service, I was excited to hear that Bose was looking to make changes with the new 700 model and made my purchase soon after the release. Needless to say, I was disappointed on almost every level and will continue using my QC-15s. Firstly, the voice control system is awful, especially for people coming from a more unified voice assistant system. It is clunky and cumbersome. Secondly, I found the legendary comfort of the old QC models to be totally absent from this rigid and stiff product. Thirdly, I find that older models are a much better investment; $400 for this product is an astoundingly bad deal, especially considering the quality typically associated with previous Bose products. I wanted to love these and thought I was in for a treat. After using this product for a few weeks, I can honestly say that there was never a moment when I thought I would keep them. I was committed to giving them time and did give them as much time as I could, but I felt no remorse in sending these back. I wanted to love them but just couldn't."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-05,These are hot garbage,"For use with a phone, these are fine. Nice noise cancellation. However, if you want to use these with Windows 10 they are hot garbage. Until the latest firmware update they didn't stay connected at all. Now, they stay connected until they are shut off and then they won't reconnect until the computer is rebooted. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy these at all."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-06,Requires the App to connect or switch. This is extremely unreliable!,Not usable if you use with multiple devices. Switching between is vert difficult. Huge regression from QC35. Customer support was useless.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-07,Great productI,"I love everything about them except they come with absolutely no directions. A booklet with one page in English and a million other pages in foreign languages telling you to download their Bose app. I finally had to call them to get a manual which is 56 pages, at least one third are disclaimers. Now that I have a manual, I found many features I didn't know it had."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-11-08,Bad luck,"Not sure if I have bad luck or what, but I""ve had to return them twice. I am currently awaiting the arrival of my third and final attempt at the headphones. When they actually work they are amazing. However, my first pair had some type of shortage and the left ear would only hiss noise and not play music. My second pair would say that it was charged for twenty hours and then die immediately and refuse to turn on. I am hoping that this third pair will actually work, because I do love the sound quality and headphones themselves. If not Im going to get my money back and go somewhere else."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-11-09,Such a good attempt...but a huge fall,"The best noise cancellation and mic sound quality you will find! The worst app experience I have ever encountered. Bose please fire you app team. The app is God awful in so many ways. It disconnects constantly. It evens fails to connect when the headphones are ALREADY connected to my phone. Why??? Because the app experience is just bad. I do remember when Bose QC35 had the same issues. Guess what...my QC35s still don’t use the app because it barely works. Love Bose sound quality, but the app experience to access certain settings is just deplorable."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-09,Got earrings? Still good.,"I love these headphones. I moved to an office where we don't' really have cubes anymore and bought them to tune people out but I find myself wearing them everywhere but the gym. I did try them once there but found that my wireless soundsport is just better for all the movement. I'm not complaining about that though. No complaints actually. I bought them for the office and am getting a lot more wear out of them than I expected. Side note, I have a lot of earrings, like and industrial and such. Because of that, I've never really been able to wear over the ear headphones for more than an hour. Like I said, I wear them all the time."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-10,"Same Tech, More Expensive","Not much of an improvement over the QC35II. No idea why these are $400. Typically for a similar version of technology that’s been out before the price goes down, not up."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-10,Noise cancellation is awesome,I liked it very much.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-10,A giant step backward!,"I bought these for the phone call noise cancelling because I work in a noisy environment. My QC35’s work well but these promised better performance. NOT worth it! They would occasionally change noise reduction settings (0,5, &10) when my phone was jostled in my pocket. Most annoying is the “tap twice” on the right ear cup to turn music on and off. The tapping is disconcertingly loud and uncomfortable. I don’t know who thought two noisy taps were preferable to a simple button push. Did I mention how LOUD that sounds to your right ear?! BUTTONS WORK BETTER IMO
I won’t get into being forced to download and interface through the phone app.
Just another case of taking a great product and making it worse. A shame...I hope Bose will go back to the classic QC design and simply improve them. They’re much more comfortable and easy to use than the 700’s. Sending mine back!"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-11-11,Not worth jt,The wireless headphones don’t work as well the original version with the wire. On planes I can still hear noises like babies crying.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-11,Not for most Earthlings,"The QC 35s in 2016 were better than these for me. The main problem with the 700 is the firmware and app. Sound quality is still awesome and noise cancellation works. With the 35, I was able to sleep wearing them. The 700 automatically shutoff; they detect activity or none. This is important to know: everytime these turn on and off, there is a LOUD “Wowmp” noise. It will irritate you when you’re half awake or asleep. I’m confident these were not evaluated by a human on my planet."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-11,Cannot switch the bluetooth input source,"I was eagerly waiting for this but unlike the previous generation such as Bose QC headphones, this one does not provide a means of changing the bluetooth connection input source. For example, if I want to connect to my TV when it is currently connected to my iPad, there is no way of doing this. This is one step forward and ten steps backwards."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-11,Amazing head phone,"Really just amazing, and the fact that it does Bluetooth 5.0 makes them better then the sony's"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-11,Good,Good headphones
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-12,Great work tool - updating my review...(stability issues),"UDPATE - after a few weeks of using this bluetooth connectivity started to become more and more unstable. Drops during calls. Seems to have some stability issues with the iPhone X. Additionally the amount of keyboard clicking noise the microphone picked up was unacceptable. I had to be on mute during conference calls or someone would think I was banging HARD on a keyboard. The noise cancelling ""features"" of the microphone did not live up to the advertisement. I really, really wanted to like these. Sending them back. I'm on conference calls sometimes five hours a day. These have been a great wireless solution for listening/talking to webexs or phone conference calls. The noise cancellation really puts me in the meeting and eliminates a lot of home office distractions. Microphone works great and people say I sound very clear. I find them extremely comfortable compared to earlier models. They feel very light to me. About the only complaint is the noise cancelling microphone does absolutely zero to muffle my keyboard clicking when I am on calls. Muffles background noise extremely well, but not a keyboard. Connectivity was a breeze. Glad I bought them."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-12,Great cancelling and sound. Interface can improve,"The only downside is, Bose needs to get its connection better across platforms (Joining Apple and Microsoft OS at the same time). It constantly disconnects when attempting a call in this setup."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-11-13,"Troubled Headset: NC is good, but connection and reliance on App are questionable","I had two headsets. The first one developed a bad hiss when the mics were enabled. This is very problematic when you are trying to have a phone call. The second unit did not have this hiss problem. However in both instances, reliance on an iOS or Android App to prep the headset and to help manage the connection became problematic. The biggest issue was when I used the headset with a PC while connected to a phone. The connection would drop and connect frequently between the phone and the headset when I used the Hands Free protocal with the PC. In the end, this experience does not justify the high cost point."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-13,"Great Noise Cancelation, but awful comfort and no respect of customer privacy","I am a Bose fan and have always loved my Bose products until this 700 NC headphone. The headphones have some great capabilities, the NC works better than on my QC35, they drown the drone of airplane engines better for example. I like the USB-C port, and the battery life and sound quality is slightly improved from my QC35. However I cannot give these headphones more than one star for a few reasons:
- I am outraged that I have to install an app to start using the headphones, and to add insult to injury I have to create a new online account, without it giving me a chance to review a privacy policy, and forcing me to let them collect info about me without knowing how they will use them. This is in violation of GDPR but not being in Europe Bose is not concerned...
- Nevertheless I wanted to use the headphones and created an account to configure them. Wearing the headphones for a short time I could enjoy the NC and sound quality they felt a bit tight on my head but I expected they'd be fine. But on my first flight over 3 hours I started feeling a major headache wearing these, They squeeze my head so hard as to give me a headache as well as pain behind and below the ears. I am going to switch back to my QC35 and maybe give the Sony a try. Too bad as I had been such a Bose supporter until they decided to build a flagship product that does not care about the customer's privacy and comfort."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-14,Best Headphones I've ever used,Best pair of headphones I've ever used! Bose lives up to their advertising.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-14,Amazing quality,Love them !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-14,Good sound and mike quality,Using it for listening music and conference calls. It works great.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-14,Great for office use and crowded traveling.,"Absolutely amazing. I use them in an office full of people and ambient noise. They are great. Noice canceling works perfectly and coworkers have to actually tap in my shoulder to get my attention. Last week travel from Spain to Uruguay (12hs) sitting next to the engine exit door and was able to sleep like a baby and not hear any unwanted notices with noice canceling on 10 and music on low settings. Overall I recommend this to all people who use headphones for work or needs to do some crowded traveling. On the other hand, for music I feel is missing some bass . Other than that they are perfect."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-15,Very happy,"I've tried many wireless headphones that can answer calls, including Jabra, PowerBeats Pro and others and these Bose are head and shoulders above anything I've ever tried. Not only is the music quality and noise canceling great, they work great when I have my laptop and phone connected to them. They work seamlessly between my laptop and when a call comes in, the laptop pauses and while I speak on the phone. The microphone quality on phone calls is much better than I expected, people I talk to say the sound quality is great. I even took a phone call while my wife was vacuuming nearby and the other caller had no idea of the sounds in the room. The battery time is excellent (around 20 hours after a full charge) and if I need a quick charge, I can get 3 1/2 hours using a 15 minute charge. Although a little expense, they are well worth it."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-15,Perfected Bose wireless headphones.,Simply amazing. I work in an office with an open floor plan. Great for conference calls. Cancels out all surrounding noise and allows people on other end to hear just me. Great Bose sound as usual for music.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-15,Greatest NCH,Best Bose ever! !
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-15,Extremely Uncomfortable,The headphones were so uncomfortable. They actually hurt the top of your head if you have them on for more than 20 minutes. Very disappointing. Dont know how they dont test these things beforehand. A lot of people saying the same thing.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-16,Stay calm,"Thanks for the one day prime locker delivery! Had a few issues at first with bt/app/update/Google asst, but stayed calm and worked my way through it. Setup is now complete. As for the price, Bose is like Apple when it relates to sticker price--everything is 2x what it should cost. Once I put these cans on, I couldn't take them off. Sound isolation, comfort and fit was flawless. Felt more like I was inside the music then just hearing it. Set up custom EQ with the Google Music app for a wider range of tones. The touch sensor was no gimmick and worked as advertised. My phone is an international unlocked LG G8 thinQ. I hope this review helps people who may be on the fence. Not sure where or why there are any negative reviews on here. But maybe it's operator error, technological misunderstanding, outdated hardware, lack of patience or?"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-16,"Expensive, but the best set of noise cancelling headphones on the market!","They are pricey, but they are a great fix and really comfortable. The option to set different noice canceling levels is awesome and the built in mic for phone calls is awesom too!"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-17,More bass,"They are amazing headphones. Not quite worth the 400 bucks tho... While lying down they slide off your head so you have to adjust them a certain way. They could also do SOOOOOO much more with the bass considering the headphones cost 400 bucks... Other than that, noise cancellation is amazing, they are super comfortable, the battery life is amazing, and the touch control is amazing"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-17,Improvement over Qc35!,"Im very impressed by the sound quality, Not too much bass witch is a preference for me. Very Detailed sound, can hear every instrument. Don't regret my purchase. They get very loud!"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-18,"Great noice cancellation, bad design","This is my first pair and they work great for noise cancellation. One of the biggest things I don't like about the design is the fact that when I put them on and lay backwards, they fall off the back of my head due to how the ear pieces turn."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-18,The Best sound you Never Heard,"I just received the headphones today straight from Bose. I can spend my time writing about the aesthetics and the suppleness of the cushions that cradle my ears...but I'll leave that to the experts. If you're a regular guy like me, you want to know if its going to improve your marriage. You gotta know that if you plan to shell out $400, right? Well, let me tell you that it will absolutely move your marriage to the next level. What I am about to share is anecdotal, but hey that's life. My wife and I have been married 30 loving years. She loves to keep the home cool at artic levels. Who can sympathize with me? I have to put on a jacket in the house during the summer and winter. She has to have background noise when she sleeps. So she has a tornado sounding fan in our bedroom. Bose did not solve the artic blast in our home, but it did completely solve the sound of the tornado that lives in our bedroom. For the first time in 30 years, I can enjoy the sound of nothingness. It's like magic. I've tried marriage counseling (kidding honey), different fans, pleading, but only Bose made it happen. Here are the facts:
1. Noise cancelling...Superb
2. Comfort...I'll be sleeping wearing them
3. Phone calls...Had a conference call with my team and I felt like I was in the room...and I never had to repeat myself. 4. Sound Quality...It's a BOSE for goodness sake. 5. Marriage...kicked it up a notch...I have to buy another one so my wife can sleep through my snoring and sleep whistling. 6. Should you buy them? Only if you want experience bliss."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-18,no,nice
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-18,Best headphones I ever had,Amazing can block all types of noise even my wife lol.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-19,AM I THE ONLY ONE?,"My Quiet Comfort 35's have been bullet proof over the last year or so, but I wanted the ""conversation"" feature and a general upgrade so I purchased the 700's one month ago--that's how long they lasted! ""Conversation"" mode was spotty at best, then the signal started to go-- static, and strange sounds---then they started disconnecting on their own, and then going through the connection sequence over again. Crazy bad hardware or software, I couldn't figure out which. I returned them just in time. My Comfort 35's still work great. Reminds me of the Bose sleepbuds I bought, which also were bad news, and you might have read that Bose is giving up on the product and taking returns from all purchasers. I'm trying to return mine but have as yet had no response from Bose. Maybe brought the produces to market too quickly? ?"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-19,my two cents.,noise-cancelling microphone is the only redeeming quality over the Sony 1000 headphones.
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-11-19,Just so so.,Not what I am looking for. The sound quality is not bad but not great for sure. Was expecting more. Can not recommend at this price point!
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-19,Quit working after 3 months - Changing this to a 4 - Bose worked with me and replaced item,"I like the product , but at $300 these headsets should last for years! NOT 3 months. I am trying to get warranty support, but am having trouble. IF this is not taken care of quickly through a return or some other method of reimbursement, I will never buy Bose again. I have Apple Airpods that have lasted over a year, and are 1/2 the price!! BOSE sent me a new pair, after I returned the old pair, and I am now using the new headphones. If I have any issues this could change, but they stood behind their product. I love the product, as I said before, but only giving a 4 due to the headaches of the return, and getting new one, and I do not think such an expensive headphone should have issues like this.. but I know it happens..There are always lemons."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-20,Great sound,Items was exactly as described very high quality
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-20,Good but not perfect,good but not perfect
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-20,Designed for road warriors that also want to use these on their laptops,"Why I picked this over WH-1000XM3:
These headphones maintain Bluetooth connections with multiple devices without the need to manually disconnect. For example, as I type this, it is streaming music from the laptop and it will automatically switch to the phone if I get a call. I haven't seen this feature mentioned in reviews but it is a killer app for people that will use the headphones on a device other than their cell phone. Pros:
Good noise cancellation
Good sound quality. I think they are comparable to Sony WH-1000XM3 and it becomes a matter of personal preference. Ability to maintain multiple Bluetooth connections and switch seamlessly between devices
Cons:
The case is a bit bulkier than the case for QC35, not by much, but by enough it does show when you try to pack it away in carryon/laptop bags. It doesn't work when it's charging via USB-C. No adaptive noise canceling though I never found the Sony adaptive noise canceling to work all that well."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-21,Appears I received a refurbished unit,"The product I received appeared to be factory sealed. Upon opening the box, I noticed the carrying case was upside down in the box, which didn't appear to be a big deal at first. After removing the headphones from the case, I was unable to power them on. They were completely dead. Odd. After charging and powering them on, the audio prompt announced they were attempting to pair with someone's iPhone. This should be impossible as this should be the first time they've ever been used. Only explanation I can think of is they're refurbished, which is majorly not ok since this is not disclosed in the product description and I also paid full retail price."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-21,Great sound quality and tremendous noise reduction.,"I use these headphones to listen to music while I’m on the stationary bicycle at the fitness club. There is a LOT of ambient noise. While the music is playing, the noise is gone. I had an ancient pair of Bose headphones that these replaced. The difference in sound quality is very noticeably improved. VERY noticeably. I love them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-22,Best Headphones Ever!,Best headphones ever. Takes you to a different world when you have them on noise cancellation! Great Features make these worth every penny.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-22,"Pricy, but a nice upgrade from my QC-25s","I picked these up to replace a pair of Bose QC-25s, and they turned out to be a very nice upgrade. It's nice to have built-in Bluetooth, and I really like the new touch controls. Sound quality is as good or better than the QC-25s, and the variable amount of noise cancellation is a nice improvement."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-24,Amazing,Life changng for working in coffee shops and coworking spaces.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-25,Best headphones,These are awsum headphones the best i ever had so far and i had 3 different kinds ....AAAAAA++++++++
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-27,That extra $100 is worth the battery life...,"These headphones are by far the best Bose has done yet. I love the styling, the multi Bluetooth device capabilities and the noise cancellation is great on planes."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-27,They’re not good as advertised,Actually I was expected more for almost 400 dollars
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-27,Don’t- Just Don’t,"Considering my most expensive headphones were $39.99 you’d Think I would be pretty easy to please. I might’ve been if I had been able to get this $400 pair to connect. And stay connected. Granted, they did connect when first paired - an auto update was occurring as I was setting up my new account. The first five minutes were cool- since then one app recognizes (Bose connect) and the other says unavailable (Bose Music)
I’ve cleared the connections and started over to no avail. Yes, I could get on the phone with some sort of tech support to figure out why mine- LIKE MANY, MANY OTHERS can’t stay (or even initialize) connected but the point is - I shouldn’t have to do so. Now my son is jamming on the $40 headphones I gave him when this ultra expensive BOX came and I’m left, like many other reviewers, writing a I can’t believe this - totally disappointed- review. Lesson learned- name and price doesn’t always mean better or as in this case it doesn’t even mean working. GOING BACK. Going Sony."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-11-28,A good investment,Does what it's supposed to for a professional musician. Very good with wireless and wired connections.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-29,Best for phone calls in noisy places,"I travel for work constantly, and these headphones have made airports and loud restaurants adequate for taking phone calls and participating in conference calls. On the receiving end, you hear the caller loud and clear--no distractions from surrounding noise. On the other end of the call, others hear your voice as if you're in a quiet office. To me, this is the holy grail of headphones for which I've been searching. I've owned lots of multi microphone headsets, and none can come close to these. Voice isolation via an 8-microphone system really does the trick. When not working, I really like the noise cancelling while on an airplane. I can listen to music or watch movies at reasonable volume levels. I previously owned the QC-35's and I would say these are a little better--but not by much. I also considered buying the Sonys but I read reviews about poor performance for making phone calls. For me this was a deal breaker as my top priority is being able to talk on the phone from just about anywhere."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-30,NOT noise cancelling,"The noise cancellation doesn't do what I expected, in fact I have the headphones on right now and I can hear everything that is going on around me, I'm watching tv with my husband and I can hear him arguing at the tv and I can hear every ounce of the show he is watching. When I was on the plane yesterday I could also hear the people around me. To me the noise cancellation does not work. Not worth the price."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-11-30,Great Office Noise Cancelling,"I don't work in an open office area (thank goodness) but I do share an office with a great guy who unfortunately likes to eat carrots on a health-conscious day and chips on a non-health-conscious day. Crunching either way. Also, we have a bus stop outside the window and the idling bus engine noise reverberates in the office terribly. This headphone took care of both these issues even when I didn't have any music or a podcast playing. My officemate's conversations with others in the office are barely audible. I rated the sound quality and bass response (since Amazon asked) as 3-star but don't go by me for sound quality, I'm 62. I had problems with the first set I received...after maybe an hour or so there was a pop then hiss in the left earcup. Pivoting the earcup up/down solved it for a few minutes but then the problem recurred. I called Bose and they did some troubleshooting and we decided I should return to Amazon. The process was painless so far, I just sent back the original yesterday. I hope the replacement Amazon sent will work as I expect - I've owned an A20 aviation headset for four years and it's worked flawlessly."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-11-30,"Bose Control app is not funtional, makes head phones worthless.","I ordered 2 pairs of these, and was excited to receive them, BUT... Without the online app from Bose, for your phone, they are pretty much worthless. You can't adjust, it or pair them to the control the app. I tried three phones and two headsets . if you read the reviews in all the online guides which I should have done before I bought them, everybody has the same thing to say, they do noise cancel, but you have no control over the entire operation of the headphone because the applications are buggy and it won't work, and the head sets will not pair with the app. It's a shame I was really looking forward to using these headphones, but I returned them both and I'm getting Sony's, which I understand work Flawlessly. You think a company like Bose would be able to design an application that you could use on your phones, linking to their headsets to operate the headphones, but sadly that is not the case. With out the app, 90% is the functionality, is not available. Major blunder, by Bose."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-11-30,Prefer the older model,"Got this one to use in noisy office environment. The older model with a simple on/off switch and replaceable battery is much easier to operate. I still take the old one when traveling for work. With this, when placed the high noise reduction setting it cuts out the background noise very well. If you need to conduct phone calls in a very noisy environment this is perfect. But when not on the phone, the noise reduction works so well you end up hearing some conversations clearly when you just want silence so you can focus on your work; wish there is Silent mode. The first Bose 700 headphone died abruptly within a month. Took to the Bose store they can’t even boot it up. If you buy it here then the store Can Not process your warranty. You can only do it by phone , mail it in and wait for it to return. My case took about a month! Next time just buy it from a Bose retail store."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-01,Bose better if call audio quality important to you.,"I use the jeadphones for business amd personal use. I read several bose vs sony reviews anf many bose and sony reviews on Amazon and tried both at best buy. Bose has mucj better voice quality on a call. Sony has better bass but bose has better tonal clarity. Noise cancelling is about the same Sony is $50 cheaper but $50 didnt factor into the equation on somethibg i expect to have for 3-5 years. I dont want my voice to be anything less than crystal clear when on the phone no matter what so the the decision was easy. - bose
The headphones have a sophisticated micriohone array and circuitry thst filter out wind / other noise so the person in the other end hears you like you were in a quiet room. Swiping in the side of the headphone for volume up / down. Forward / backward etc. Wirk good. As many have said the app is klunky but you really only use it whwn settibg up the headpho es first time or when you change the power down timer valie. I love the headphones. calls and to block out noise so i can concentrate better."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-01,Very good but not perfection.,"I wear headphones 12-18 hours a day, every day. These have been my go-to since they were released. I bought them after I had to return the Sony WH-1000XM3 due to the cold-weather issues they have. These headphones have a lot going for them and you won't go wrong with them. That said, I'd like to bring up a few issues I have with them, that might bother you too. There is no equalizer or any other kind of level adjustment through the Bose sound app or otherwise. This seems like a major oversight by Bose - but their history has taught me that it's very unlikely they will ever address this shortcoming. Which leads into my biggest complaint: I tried on my old Sony MDR-1000X (the original, old ones) and discovered that I actually preferred the slightly warmer, bassy tone. I also discovered that they cancel noise better than these, which surprised me given Bose's track record and the fact that pretty much every reviewer and rater will tell you otherwise. It's absolutely the case, however, that if I'm running my vacuum cleaner wearing the Bose, I can hear it running, and wearing the Sony MDR-1000X, I can't. Also, a minor complaint - there's a bug in the button that lets you switch noise canceling levels; I have to hit it three times to get it to activate the first time after I turn the headphones on. Minor but still not fixed after two or three firmware updates. There's only two things I can think of these headphones do that the Sony WH-1000XM3 won't: 1) Sony won't pair to and switch between two devices automagically. 2) The Sonys flake out, badly, in sub-zero temperatures. Rumor has it Sony might have fixed that second problem and if they have, I'd prefer theirs to these. Note that despite the similar model numbers I'm talking about two different Sony headphones in this review."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-02,Great Noise cancellation headphones,The noise cancellation on these headphones is excellent. It does really well on people speaking nearby. I share in the office with my wife and she is on the phone a lot. These do an excellent job of muting her voice. Better than the qc 35 headphones did. Works even better on other noise. The microphone works great for phone calls. What about the sound? The sound is really good. Not super heavy on the bass which I prefer. The battery life is great and touch controls on the ear cup is handy and work well once you start to get used to where the cup is so you are tapping and swiping in the correct place. If you can swing the cash you will be very happy with these. \
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-02,DONT BUY THESE BOSE HEADPHONES,"I had had two Bose headphones in the past. I do not like these particular headphones because they are so complicated to use. Very disappointed. The sound suppression feature is weak, even on the high setting. I do not recommend these. I intended to return these, but evidently several days over the cut off date, of which I had no knowledge. Very disappointed. I intend to be more discerning when ordering any more high dollar items from Amazon. I am a disabled Vietnam veteran on a fixed income and it difficult to put out $430 for an item that is not up to standards."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-03,"They look amazing, the sound is great","I'm a fan of Bose, but have to say I am a bit disappointed in the lack of innovation. The product is great but not worth the price tag vs other Bose products. The Siri/Google Home/ Alexa integration is terrible and glitchy. So is the app it comes with. Battery life is great, it lasts 19 hours or so. Noise cancellation is great."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-04,Good headphones but not worth the price at all,"For the price point, this needs to be a whole lot better. The noise cancellation was good, but it kept falling off of my head when I wore them while working out. Also, the sound quality when music is playing is not the best (too high pitched). Also, when making calls, the person on the other line will hear all of the background noises, and there is an echo in my headphones as well."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-05,painful to wear for an extended time,painful to wear for an extended time
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-05,One word - Intrusive,"In order to use this device, you need to download an app Bose Music. Then you have to create an account, then, in order to do anything at all with the settings, you must turn on your GPS. I find this unacceptable. I don't use GPS on my phone (unless I need it) for 2 reasons: 1, battery life is significantly decreased 2. What business is it of Bose to know where I am and how is that relevant to the operation of a HEADPHONE? I called their phone support and the answer I got that in order to use any of the settings of the phone I had to use GPS. That is dumb. Well I'm promptly returning this device and will NEVER buy another BOSE product again as long as they have that condition attached. It's a shame because the sound quality is fantastic. I recommend to Bose to eliminate that ""feature"". I gave it a one star, I couldn't go lower but would, just on the operation of this device."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-06,Buy them now!,"Has every feature you could want including the ability to control the noise cancellation level, built in microphone so you can see it to answer calls, great battery life, also supports direct wire usage, connects to multiple devices. Has excellent sound quality. Comfortable fit. The gesture controls work great. Even the case is well designed. These are worth every penny."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-06,"No real complaints, banger.",Case could a bit of a harder material or be offered Ina different material. Other than that. 5*
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-06,Listen to music the way its intended to,"INITIAL STARTUP : Out of the box, these were really easy to connect to my iphone and the Bose Music app. However updating the firmware on the headphones took 5 hours, you can still use them throughout that time but come on! Not even my PC takes that long. CONTROLS : Just as usual, Bose products lack instructions. I consider myself fairly competent when it comes to electronics, and these were kind of hard to use at first. There is no manual that tells you how to use the headphones, or what the buttons do. Just a big booklet with terms and conditions and a picture that basically says ""Download the Bose App"". As other reviewers have stated, you need the app if you want the full features. BOSE APP : So the Bose music app can be hit or miss. Sometimes it wont recognize that the headphones are connected and you cant change the settings. When you manage to connect it and try to change something you will be greeted with a stuck white screen. After owning several Bose products, this happens to their speakers as well which is ridiculous considering this is BOSE and not some startup company. How can they make such an atrocious app when it comes to it actually working. Here are the things you can do in the app.
- Change the name of the headphones. - View what devices are connected to the headphones. - Pick between google and alexa as voice assistant. - There is a ""shortcut button on the headphones that can be programmed to hear the battery level or to basically turn on and off the voice assistant. - An option to see how much of your voice you can hear while on a call. - There is an ANC button that can be programmed to 3 different presets, ranging from 0-10. - How long before the headphones power off when not in use. There is no EQ.
COMFORT : While these have a moderate clamping force, its not so much to the point where it just hurts. I would say these have a medium clamping force with something like the QC35s and Sony XM3s having a ""soft"" clamping force. I can wear these for 2-3 hours at a time. But I will always feel like ""they're there"". Unlike some headphones that are so comfortable that you forget you're wearing them. CABIN PRESSURE : Some ANC headphones give me and some people a feeling of pressure....as if your head is being squeezed. This definitely have some pressure feeling, but nowhere near as much as the QC 35s. I would rank them as having more cabin pressure than the Sony XM3s. However the pressure is relieved when you have ANC off. With ANC off the headphones thankfully sound the same as with it on. NOISE CANCELLING : Not much to say here, with just ANC turned out 90% of the outside world turns off, start playing your music and you basically cant hear the outside world at all. SOUND : Now to the important part. These headphones make music sound the way its intended to sound. When you listen to a song, you never feel like something is missing. You never feel like the vocals are high pitched, or like it has too much base. There is no ""tiny"" soundstage, or too spread out. Its hard to explain but these just have a perfect balance where you will listen to a song, and it won't make you think ""I wish these had more base, mids, louder, etc"". They have a very clear sound as well, they don't sound muffled at high volumes. Instrument separation is also excellent. While using these headphones I started hearing things in songs that I have never heard before. Songs don't just clutter like in other headphones where it just sounds like noise. With the 700s it feels like music is being played. MOVIES : On a last note, I tried these headphones with different movies, one that caught my attention is are the Dark Knight chase scenes since they have alot of bass, let me tell you these headphones are definitely not made for movies. It sounded so flat that you will feel absolutely nothing when watching movies, no “excitement”. I actually thought the headphones were not connected properly at first, but they were. Something to keep in mind. In case you are looking for an ANC/Non-ANC audio device, I will rank a few of the ones I own from best to worst taking into account sound quality and ANC. 1) Bose 700s
2) Sony XM3 : Vey close second, Im a huge fan of these, they are better than the 700s in every single way except sound quality. The sound of the Sonys just sounds muffled compared to Bose due to too much bass. But they're still good and the Sony's are definitely much, much better for movies. 3) Airpods Pro: The sound on these is actually in between the SONY XM3s and the Bose. They sound very clear and balanced. 4) Powerbeats Pro: Surprisingly these sound very good. I would say they sound about the same as airpods pro. 5) Bose QC35 : These sound the ""worst"" but they still sound good. To be honest these aren't worth it anymore. If you’re an ANC nerd, I bet it comes down to the SONY XM3s or the Bose 700s. The best I can say is that the Sonys are more “fun” to listen too. They have a much more exiting sound that makes you want to dance. Its more “in your face” type of feeling. However it is not as clear as the bose. The 700s sound crystal clear, its very hard to find any part of a song that sounds overdone. Can’t go wrong with either one, ANC is basically the same, it all comes down to wanting audiophile headphones (700s) or fun headphones (Sony xm3)."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-07,This is a mind blowing product that surpasses initial expectations.,"Irate I want to explain that I work on a tugboat. As engineer I sleep right next to the engine room. This environment is loud and filled with audible vibration all the time. These headphones take this environment and it’s like 90% soundproof cups were placed over my ears at level 10 noise reduction. I have walked into the engine room with them too. I stood between two locomotive engines. I turned on my music, while the engines made some noise, I heard my music clearly. After this test I called my wheelman standing between these engines and had a conversation with him. I didn’t have to yell. Talking on the phone is clear. Noise canceling cuts out wind noise and lowers the sound of the generator I work around daily. People can hear me clearly on phone calls. I have let three people try them and 2/3 are buying a pair now. These headphones are NOT made for sweaty exercise. This isn’t a con towards the product. This is a fact to be respected while you responsibly use the product. The, let as much of the environment in as you wish , claim Bose makes is completely true. The adjustable lvls of noise cancellation, three custom presets, back up this claim fully. The construction of this product is made for durability and comfort. I’ve been a Bose fan for 20 years. This product represents all the qualities Bose stands for. If your a fan of Bose then you’ll understand this. If your not, maybe you will be after use."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-07,Descepcionante producto,Las almohadillas de los audífonos estan desteñidas y deterioradas. Asi encontré el producto cuando abri mi paquete. Totalmente decepcionado por el precio pagado y la calidad recibida.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-08,Great headphones,"The top review about these not working without the Bose app is false. I do not have a smart phone and the headphones still work great. Also I had my wife do a “blind” side by side test with the previous model of over-ear, wireless, noise cancellation headphones and these were noticeably better. Great product."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-09,Works great,My husband can actually hear conversations when listening
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-09,Best Bose yet!,Best Bose yet! Highly recommend!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-09,Perfect,"An all around solid set of phones. No cons ... besides the steep price, but you get what you pay for."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-10,The best headphones!,Just WOW!
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-10,Do not buy,I got this in October and they do not work anymore . This thins atrash do not buy
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-11,Noise cancelling for the win,These are amazing. So comfortable and the noise cancelling works great. I used them on a tour bus and they cancelled out the loud hum of the bus perfectly.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-11,Great Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I absolutely love these headphones. My family and I are currently staying with my wife’s sister until we close on our new home and we have four little ones and she has two. To say these kids are loud would be an understatement. However, when I put on these bad boys, I’m in another place where peace and quiet rule the day. Now, Bose headphones are known for their pure sound and not for the over abundance of bass. So keep that in mind when you purchase."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-11,Great for music at this stage not ready for calls,Bluetooth issues while on calls (disconnects calls while you get notified from other devices).
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-11,Bose Fanboy Disappointed,"I wanted to own these. I really wanted Bose to keep my money. I have owned the QC35s for years and have several other Bose products and love the brand and customer service (serious I would bend over backwards and gladly pay more of their products were even with others). These headphones look beautiful. But the design team responsible for how they feel on your head put form (how they look) over function (how the feel, their comfort wearing them). This can never be the case, you must put function first. The comfort is a primary function and that did not follow the form and design of these. I'm a normal medium sized head and I am disappointed. After testing these out for 10 days and comparing them to the significantly lower costing Sony 1000XM3 I can confidently say these headphones are extremely uncomfortable and had to be returned. Hopefully in their next version they will take notes from their prior successes and will prioritize comfort. This is a big step back from previous Bose headphones. Arguably the most important thing was creating a COMFORTABLE pair of headphones but I consistently found myself having to take these off after only 30-45 mins of wearing to adjust and get comfortable."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-12-11,No directions included and three of us could not make Alexa work,"I ended up finding what I wanted to listen to on my phone and then turning on the headphone. It was not the convenient voice operated headphone we anticipated. Not worth the extra money. Difficult to operate and no good support. Three people with tech experience tried to get it working, It should have been a no brainer and not a puzzle. So disappointed in Bose and Amazon."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-12,"Great audio, but uncomfortable with a few hiccups","This series of Bose was very interesting. The adjustable earcups are cool in theory, but catch a lot and don't move smoothly. The biggest negative for this headset for me personally was the new padding coming from qc35s is REALLY uncomfortable. The foam is thinner and more rigid creating more discomfort around the ear pressure becomes more of an issue due to this. Great sound quality as always, needs a bit more bass."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-12,Very good product from Bose,A very good product from Bose
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-12,Don't buy it,I have always gotten the Bose Noise Cancelling headphones. After this purchase I probably won't ever again. First you need their app on the phone just to be able to pair it with devices. That being said the biggest issue is the headphones keep dropping the connection with the device. Tried it on both a tablet and Apple Watch and had the same issue with both. I have tried the same devices with Sony Wireless headphones with absolutely no issues. With the tablet it literally drops the connection every 10 - 15 minutes! Pretty hard to watch something when that happens.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-12,Great headphones,Pretty great headphones. I dont know why others are having issues. The noise cancellation is great and the mic's they put in these are fantastic. Battery life is also tremendous. 10/10 would buy again
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-13,"Not the best, but great headphones!","Great headphones with outstanding detail in the mids and highs. Bass is a little weak, but soundstage is wonderful! I'm tired of so many people stating that these won't work without the app: THEY DO! Just connect them through the settings of the phone. I connected without the app! Not as good as the Bowers &Wilkins or Sennheiser, but it's close. In call quality, it's the best!"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-13,QC35II is more comfortable to me,Not sure if others feel the same. I had both QC35II and 700. and I travel a lot . BOSE is the best for the value in my opinion. But QC35II is more comfortable to me after hours of using. 700 does have better look though.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-13,They're just another a pretty face,They look expensive and well made. But after almost a months of wearing them I'm starting to note that left side its louder than right side. Also the ANC it's not what BOSE claim. Having to use the app for everything makes me crazy. I'm going to give them another chance. But I'm overall im disappointed of these 700.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-13,Perfect!,These headphones are the next generation of perfection! Noise cancellation are superb whereas the sound is exactly what you get with Bose. I really love these. I got a pair for my wife too and she is just in Heaven over them! I love the Alexa set up where I only need to talk and say the wake word. I have never had headphones other than cheapies to get buy. Thought I would try these and I am just so happy I did! For anyone who enjoys great sound without outside noise....get them!
Bose,NC700,3,0,2019-12-13,why is there no volume control on the headphone ??,i have to have the phone on hand to control the volume without having to shout in front of people to the digital assistant like a crazy person
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-13,Severe ear pain.,Noise canceling too strong it causes eardrums pain after few minutes. Annoying announcement of noise canceling level; no option to turn that off. No auto-pause. Ear cups smaller. Not comfortable as others. Very disappointed
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-14,Disappointed in This Bose Product,"I bought these headphones and then decided to return them after 2 weeks and went back to my old QC35II’s. I’m a Bose fan who is disappointed in this product, especially at a $400 price point. the Headphones look great and the improvement in the microphone for calls on the go is significant - I loved that feature. The noise cancelling is also better and they’re very comfortable. The reason for the 2 stars are:
1) there is an annoying rattle where the metal headband attaches to the Plastic ear cup that you hear when you walk, especially on uneven surfaces or if you walk fast. I looked into fixing this but seems to be a widespread issue. 2) the connection randomly dropped
3) the touch controls were clunky to use and I prefer the buttons
4) when the engines rev on the plane and it’s going to take off there is a ton of crackling noise in the headset - this was very consistent. It also happened on landing."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-14,Love it !!!,My first noise cancellation headphone and i love it.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-14,Costly but worth it,Out of this world amazing. Love the different noise cancellation levels. Makes it great for days when I’m listening doing reports but need to still hear around me.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-14,For people who don't need thumping bass and/or are on the go.,"First of all, I love the look of these headphones. The earcups look much smaller than the XM3's, and the headband is pretty low profile. However, as the headline suggests, you don't FEEL the bass. It's there, and it sounds great, but don't expect a clean head-pounding experience. Although these have an advertised battery life of 20 hours, I was able to get over 22 hours at 50% volume. These headphones also excel in very dynamic types of music. For example, when there are instruments, voices, and digital beats, these headphones bring out each sound evenly. However, if you want the full experience, you'll have to download the Bose Music app. Although this was kind of a pain, it didn't take long to set up, and the pairing process wasn't too difficult on an iPhone. Of course, these have some of the best noise-canceling as well. There are 11 levels, from 0 to 10. 0 is ambient mode, where the noise around you is pumped into the headphones. Using this has been very successful, as I not only hear everything more clearly, but it also doesn't sound fake. At level 5 you can hear your music clearly, but be able to stay in touch with your surroundings. And level 10 zones you out completely. Unlike the QC35's, there isn't much cabin pressure at all, which is nice to see (or hear). The earcups themselves also fit VERY nicely on my head. If you have a bigger head, then you might feel a bit more clamping force on the sides of your head, though. Personally, the fit perfectly, and my ears don't touch the insides at all. The touchpad also works very well, although it takes a little while to get used to it. All in all, I would give these a 9/10. The app may not be perfect, and the bass could be a bit more heavy for some people, but personally I love them just the way they are. Highly recommended!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-14,Sound is amazing,"An old story, you get what you pay for."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-15,Noise Cancelling Masterpiece!,"My work requires me to make a lot of business trips and the Bose NC700 have been an amazing companion in those long flights. The headphones have an amazing noice cancellation and sound quality. Also, very lightweight which makes longer usage a breeze. I cannot comment on the bass since it suffices for my needs. Also, most of the players have equalizers to tweak the output to your liking."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-12-15,Can’t connect properly to two Bluetooth devises simultaneously,"I have been using this headphones for past 3-4 months now, my use case is to use it in my office for meetings on my work laptop and at the same time the headphones are connected to my phone. It is not able to maintain two Bluetooth connections simultaneously and it keeps prompting when I am on meeting on my computer that the phone has disconnected and within a second it will again prompt it has connected which makes me lose what people are saying on the meeting. I have already returned one headphones and second piece also had same issue. I am on latest firmware version and everything is updated. Bose forums are full of users experiencing this issue. Bose has done horrible job in the software side. I wouldn’t recommend it if you need to make simultaneously Bluetooth connections."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-15,Prefer older model Bose headphones,I was really looking forward to the new pair of bose headphones. I've had the older pair and really enjoyed them . I've tried Sony headphones and didn't enjoy those . The new Bose were a let down. I think I'll reorder the older pair and give new set to the kids . Not impressed at all
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-15,Excellent Sound!,Great headphones! Very happy with this purchase.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-16,Bose Failed Big Time With These,The only thing better with these than the QC35 2's is that these have USB-C... that's it! Maybe noise canceling is a bit better but the important aspects are not improved. Ergonomics? Gone. Portability? Gone. Easy of use? Gone. These are great headphones but there is no clear reason to get them over the QC35 or Sony XM3. Definitely don't pay over $350 for these... they are not worth their $400 price (imo). To bose.... all we wanted were QC 35 2's but with USB-C but nope they had to change an incredible design to something that clamps on harder and has touch sensive instead of awesome buttons.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-16,"Buggy buggy, doesn’t work with iPhone or iPad, not ready for prime time","Wow, for $400 this is very buggy. It does not work with an iPhone and or an iPad. The interface is not intuitive. The connection is not good, the headphones will not turn off. When you try to turn them off you disconnect your phone and iPad and takes about 15 or 20 minutes to reconnect it again. I’m very disappointed that Bose and Apple can’t work something out to make this user interface workable. I consider myself pretty good with technical issues, and I have trouble with this.Will likely return these and not go back to Bose again. I have been with Bose all my life and I’m just pretty disappointed, especially for the price. That being said the construction is nice, but also their issues with the sound cancellation. When listening to an audiobook or music, and some noise presents itself and your surroundings, the headphones cut out and there are beeps. Just a lot of really disappointing buggy issues that make these not nearly ready for prime time."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-16,I picked Bose 700 over Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless,"I don't know why people are complaining about these headphones, they are absolutely fantastic. I've been a Sennheiser loyal fan for many years. I tried the latest Momentum 3 Wireless headphones which left me disappointed. While the sound quality was fantastic and it had some neat features Bose 700 lack, they were bulky, noise cancellation was lackluster and I experienced problems connecting to my iPhone X through Bluetooth. The headphones refused to connect for some reason. Then, I bought Bose 700 at BestBuy. WOW! What a world of difference. Sure, the sound signature is not nearly as sophisticated and rich as Sennheiser's. Nothing beats the sound quality Sennheiser headphones produce, but on every other count Bose 700 headphones are better. They are smaller, more comfortable, have softer ear pads, connect right away to my iPhone X, have a fantastic app, noise isolation is AMAZING, battery life is fantastic. Honestly, this is by far, the best pair of headphones I've ever had. Some people complain about their headphones not working after installing the latest firmware update. I installed a firmware update yesterday without any issues. I believe my battery life has improved as a result of the firmware update. BTW: In case you make lots of phone calls, Bose 700 feature the best microphone on the market today, in my opinion. The person on the other end will hear you crystal clear and any outside noise will be cut out thanks to multiple microphones integrated into the headphones. Sennheiser Momentum 3 wireless have a much weaker microphone, in comparison, allowing for more outside noise to be heard on the other end. Overall, I am extremely happy with Bose 700 headphones. I look forward to 4-5 years of usage. I recommned"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-16,"Shockingly terrible, does not work at all with my Android phone, sending it back","I replaced my beloved but broken QC35 IIs with this newer model because Wirecutter recommended it. I really liked the QuietComfort ones, but they died completely in under two years, which was pretty disappointing. The new 700 series was an even bigger disappointment. I've heard these work acceptably well with iOS devices, but with my Pixel 3, they've been nothing but trouble. The (required) app is a nightmare; it doesn't work at all. The headphones won't stay paired. Every time I turn them on, and press the voice assistant button, it says I have to ""Go to Google Assistant to finish connecting,"" even though I've done this multiple times. Effectively it means the voice assistant just doesn't work, ever. The app always says it can't find my device, even though my phone says the headphones are connected (and reports a battery status.) The battery seems to drain at an uneven and unpredictable rate. Also, my music seems to turn itself on sometimes for no reason. I went to the Google Play app store to see of other Android users had experienced these issues, and almost every review I found there was 1-star, reporting these same Bluetooth, pairing, and app issues. These headphones are too expensive to work this poorly, and I am sending them back, unlikely to ever buy another pair of Bose."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-16,Some times spotty,"Overall happy with the product but sometimes the connection is spotty. Example, it'll cut in and out when I go to the kitchen from my room (maybe 20 feet away). Also a bit annoying when the audio feed switches between the two paired devices (even if only one device is playing audio). Seems like the best solution when this happens is to pause/unpause both devices until eventually the source you want reconnects."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-16,Not for all heads,"Not that great in holding tight, when you have silky & thick hair. (Big head). Not worth 350$ since sound experience is almost same for beats Bluetooth headset."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2019-12-17,Absolute great technology very accurate voice command,Great sound! A little pricey
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-17,Great product,Excellent sound quality and noise cancelling. Comfortable fit and great battery life. I especially like the ability to adjust the level of noise cancellation in environments where I need to be aware of my surroundings.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-18,THE best headphones,"These are awesome headphones, you won't be disappointed. I travel a lot and had a pair of Beats Solo3 prior to these. These block out almost all airplane noise, I wear glasses too and these don't cause any issues with them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-19,Headphones good,Baby yoda like
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-20,BLUETOOTH KEEPS FAILING,"At this price point they should just work! I bought these because of the ability to be connected to 2 devices at once, the Bluetooth connection fails often...I spent 1 hour with their technical support team and they were of no help, tried calling customer service at Bose....just left on hold. At this price they should just work
They were returned"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-21,Don’t waste your money,"Bose has the WORST customer support I have ever encountered. I got bounced around to to about 4 different people. The last person did not understand what I needed, I understand that English is not her first language but that is not my problem. All I wanted to do is connect the headphones to a Bluetooth transmitter which is attached to my TV. I eventually just gave up. I will be returning the headphones immediately"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-21,Great cans,These are great head phones
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-22,Good,Good
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-22,Too Expensive for what it delivers,"While they do an excellent job of canceling the wind and engine noise during flights, this is often negated by the seal around the ears breaking due to jaw movements. More annoying is the burdensome process of pairing with a device as you alternate from laptop to mobile phone. Should you find them paired with a laptop while on a flight with no WiFi, you’ll find pairing them with a mobile phone an impossibility (at least for iOS). The mobile app (required for pairing) requires WiFi and account registration. None of that issue is likely unique to this product and the quality of materials is otherwise excellent. I’ll be returning as I’m unconvinced they are worth the premium over competing products, including others from Bose. The fact that this noise cancellation does little to nothing against crying babies and chatty travelers makes it of little true value for me. It’s unclear whether the app related issues are intentional in order to create a “dongle” or a casualty from the rush to production. Either way, it’s a poor experience."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-22,So uncomfortable!,"Returned. Wanted to love these, but they hurt my (small) head. The ear pressure from the headphones pressing into my head and the bar up top, even with its padding, wasn't something I could wear long-term without a headache."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-22,Amazing Comfortable & Noise Cancellation,I love these headphones and the main reason I bought them over the Sony WH-1000XM3 is because these are so comfortable. The Sony headphones hurts my head within a few minutes of wearing on. The noise cancellation is comparable between the two so comfort won out hands down.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-23,Next level Bose!,Best headphones I have ever owned. I have a pair of the Bose QC35 and those are also amazing headphones. But these take it up just a little bit more. Love the adjustable noise cancelling levels and talk through on this set. Also a lot more attractive headset as well. The office assistant or Alexa feature is awesome too.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-23,Better than ever! A quality product in all aspects!! Another Winner!!!,"The Bose 700 headphones is a luxury device. The aesthetics so sleek and clean. The muted black is so smooth with no harsh edges. I really like that the Boss logo isn’t too loud or noticeable, so I’m not advertising it during my commute. The padding on the ear pieces are so comfortable, there isn’t any pinching. The noise cancellation is impressive. It is adjustable depending how much of the outside noise I want to cancel out. I can listen to my music and not have surrounding conversation interfering with my music or calls. It is adjustable from 0-10 and can instantly cancel for conversation cancellation, which just means I can pause my music instantly to listen to conversations outside of my headphones. There are touch features where I can use my finger and swipe forward/ back to skip my music, up/ down to adjust volume, double tap to pause/ play, answer/ ignore phone calls, muting options, battery life updates. I set up my headphones to auto shutoff, which detects movement by motion sensor and if there hasn’t been any audio for a certain amount of time. All these settings are adjustable and customizable when I downloaded the Bose app. The app isn’t necessary if I just want to connect to my phone to play music. This headphones can be used wireless via Bluetooth or can be plugged in. It comes with the plugs to plug into my phone and an usb cord to charge in my outlet or laptop. When I have these headphones on, the music really surrounds my ears and really how music should be played. I can hear all the lovely music without any harsh tones and perfect bass. Bose headphones is what every headphones in the market should aspire to be. Another Winner!!! Great sound, with fantastic noise cancellation!! !"
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-24,Awful audio quality when using the microphone,"This one may just be me being an uninformed consumer, but I decided recently to upgrade my headphones to some wireless ones. I had seen people talk about this particular headphone and I even bought a fancy bluetooth adapter for my computer so that it would work. What they don't tell you is that if you intend to use this device's microphone, don't expect the good quality sound to follow you there. Apparently it's just a bluetooth issue, but as I bought these headphones specifically for gaming with other people on discord, the dramatic reduction in audio quality makes the headphones unusable. Pretty good headphones, pretty bad audio quality when using the microphone. I hope there are wireless alternatives that don't use bluetooth. Will purchase them after I return these."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-24,Great but expensive,Great noise canceling but the price is a bit to high if you can get it then go for it because these seem very high quality
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-24,Excelente Noise cancelling,Excelente producto. Muy buena cancelación de ruido
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-25,Worth the money for any trip longer than 4 hours,Completely block out airplane noise. Very comfortable even on an 11 hour flight. Buttons are a little confusing at first but you quickly get used to it.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2019-12-26,Crying baby cancellation on cross country flight 5 stars. Connectivity 1 star.,"I hope the fix the bugs soon blue tooth connection is bad. And the link to Bose site should update automatically. I want them to work. 15 blue tooth reconnects in a move is ridiculous
YouTube fix by BOSE WHEN!! !"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-26,Great,My son thoroughly loves these headphones
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-26,Amazing,"Ok so I got these about 2 weeks ago at the apple store they are limited edition(eclipse) with a charging case total of 480 plus tax. They sound very good, have great transparency mode, great call quality, and very good ANC. They were worth it and personally this is by far the best color way. The headphones last around 20 hours with an including 40 hours from the case totaling 60 hours of playback. Just wonderful..."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-26,Great product,"Works well and the noise canceling is amazing! Side note: when they dropped it off it was on my porch. The mail slot to my house is only letter size and could not accommodate a package. The person delivering the product stated, ""Package was left inside the residence’s mailbox "". Which is not accurate."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-26,Worth the price,They are everything you want while being on an airplane.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-26,Always BOSE,If you want the best...BOSE
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-27,Amazing,Love the battery life and announcement of battery time
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-27,Amaaazzzing,Amazing headphones! !
Bose,NC700,1,0,2019-12-27,Don't buy if you have windows 10,"These headphones have issues with pairing if you have windows 10. There a lot of forums about this that you can google. Headphones themselves are a little difficult to expand and contract due to the ""stick"" design. They move with difficulty and i feel like i could easily snap it. I was really hoping to like them, but not the case. They do work great with my cell phone - just not with my computer. The bose app does suck though - and i don't like the fact that i am forced to share my location in order to use the app - makes absolutely no sense why that would be a requirement ! !"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-28,Love the Bose 700 headphones!,Watched a lot of tube reviews. Decided to try the Bose 700 headphones. Wow. I am so happy I went with these new headphones vs some of the current models that exist. These new 700 headphones are comfortable and have amazing sound. Absolutely love them and they are well worth it..
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-28,Best gift,Best gift I could have ever bought for my fiancee. We travel alot internationally and he loves that they block out the noise on an airplane
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-29,Great headphones!,The sound is very good and very comfortable on your head.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-29,Great if you want the best.,Got these from my Wife for Christmas because she knows I want the best. Found a few small software operational bugs but nothing that affects the sound quality! The touch volume and forward/back controls are cool.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-30,Love it!,I received these as a Christmas gift and I absolutely love them! I just used them on a long car trip and I was able to block out both the car radio and the other passengers! All I heard was the music playing on my IPod which was awesome!
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-30,Always out of battery,"First these sound absolutely amazing, and the canceling is of course great. The problem is getting them to turn off. I have come to use these on several occasions only to find them dead. Before you start saying make during the auto turn off is on and configure but seems to ignore it. They are also fully updated, and I'm using both platforms iOS and Android."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-12-31,Very disappointed,Terrible sound quality
Bose,NC700,2,1,2019-12-31,Terrible software and mediocre headphones,"Comparing these to Sony WH-1000XM3. I prefer the Sony for everything except phone call quality. Music sound quality, bass response, noise cancelling, phone software, ease of use, fit and finish, material quality... all are better on the Sony. The only reason I purchased these Bose headphones was because of the improved microphone for voice calls. I can say the Bose do excel at this and phone calls are clear on the other end even in a noisy area such as an airport. The iPhone software is horrible. I use these headphones on an airplane and the app is basically non-functional when in airplane mode or even just turning off cellular service. So you are left with only being able to adjust noise cancelling levels via the button on the headphones. Also, you are forced to create a Bose account just to use the app. Lastly, performing a firmware update took almost 45 minutes which seems excessive compared to any other typical firmware upgrade process. If not for the voice call quality I would never use these headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-31,Best Bose NC Headphones Yet,"Easy set-up, ease of use with convenient controls, great sound and comfortable. This is my third pair of Bose NC headphones (QC15 & 25) and by far my favorite."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-01,An Honest Opinion,"With the comment section filled with complaints and comparisons, I felt like I had to write a review. First off, the app isn't as bad as past reviews say it is. Bose has updated the app and with my iPhone XS Max, I can seamlessly connect and jump from my Macbook to my iPhone, check settings, and change the level of noise cancelation. Sound quality in my opinion pretty great, before these, I had a pair of airpods v1. Though with sound quality, I feel you need to take it with a grain of salt. I suggest going to Target or Best Buy and trying them out there to see for yourself, that's what I did. Once I heard the store go pretty much silent besides a few muffled voices, and hearing the song with pretty sold quality, I was sold. Before that, I was constantly debating and watching YouTube videos on them. The controls take probably a minute to learn and you're good to go. Overall: try them out somewhere else if you're on the fence with them. These comments help but at the same time don't. I'm happy with the quality, feel, look, and silence I get when I'm doing work at home with my 3-year-old son playing. Hopefully, you don't let past non-updated reviews make your decision for you."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-01,Not gym headphones,"Great headphones, not the best for the gym though."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-01,Get the Sonys instead if you like bass.,"Super disappointed in these, I loved my older model Bose headphones and thought I’d get the new ones when I lost them. These are terrible! The fit is weird, they are too bendy and come off your head if you try to move one off your ear to speak to someone. They are also weirdly tall On the head and don’t fit flush. Then there is the sound- the noise cancelling is great but the sound is overproduced and tinny sounding with NO BASS. Like really, really terrible bass that you can’t adjust. I returned and bought the Sonys and I LOVE them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,Noise canceling and clear sounds,"I like my Bose noise canceling wireless headphones clear sound and base is good, I use when I’m listening to music."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,Great headphones!,"Absolutely love these headphones. I've used them on a couple of flights and the sound quality is great. The noise cancellation is very good, still get some ambient noise even at its highest. Highly recommend."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,Variable noise cancellation,The best wireless noise cancellation headphones I ever owned
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-02,Almost perfect,Software sucks.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,one word COMFORT,most confort ever!
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-02,Update Firmware Through App -- This is living the dream,"I am an early-adopter/prototype-buyer (My background is IT & I studied Computer Architecture at University). I started with those original Motorola BT Headphones, through a few other well-known brands, both stereo and one ear. I have Kickstarter-ed headphones made in Shenzhen by MIT Engineers. I have also helped family set up a number of Brand and Off-Brand headphones every holiday for the past 5, at least. I have never found satisfaction (except the PowerBeats2, which was better than the rest and great compared to the terrible upgrade to PowerBeats3--But I am not an audiophile [I know people with a better ear]... those were good for switching devices, despite KNOWING the audio was subpar, by design). My BOSE NC700s came with the most up-to-date firmware, but have heard the upgrade through the App is a breeze and *absolutely necessary*. My pair have been an absolute dream since I received them around 2 weeks ago. I use 4+ devices: MBP, iPhoneXR, iPadMini, Pixel2, & RaspberryPi4. Always seems to connect to the two most recent, with no trouble quickly reconnecting my phone for calls when it's connected to my MBP and iPadMini. These are truly: Executive-Level Headphones. It's no wonder that they got real popular in some Business School & MBA programs. The noise cancellation is uncanny and the battery last for 2 days, at least. If anything, they are too nice. I am getting back up to 80mi a week on the stationary bike in the gym and I can't bring myself to wear them thinking they will get worn, smelly, and not like the Absolutely Elegant unit it is. So, since BOSE has finally perfected the Bluetooth Experience (with BT LowEnergy, dual-connection-easy-handoff & tremendous Noise-Cancellation), I await Bose releasing a sport version (or update their Sport offering with this tech)."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-03,The best headphones.,These are the best headphones available today. Amazon is great company to purchase these terrific headphones from because of their user-friendly policies.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-03,Good buy,Works well and really comfortable but I would love to have more control over the sound
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-03,Pointless.,Absolutely overpriced for the quality and features. Sound cancelation is virtually unnoticed. Sure it has an affect but about the same as when they are off. Sound quality is exceptionally average. Save $300 and buy any of the other brands...like I did. You'll be happier spending the savings on a massive TV.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-04,Great sound,Sounds great love the blue tooth alittle heavy and cumbersome. Falls off my head during workouts
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-04,What a deal,Great for the price
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-04,App is a suspect (as other reviews claim) | too tight for me,"I really liked the brand new design of the headphone. However, when tried to use it, the clamping force was too much for me. It felt like it'd crush my head. Other than that, the sound was clear and I really enjoyed listening to music (although not for extended periods of time). NC and ambient pass through is EXCELLENT (10/10). Audio calls work flawlessly. App support was very poor when I tried it."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-04,My son LOVED them!,"He asked for these headphones for Christmas and he knows and loves his music, so they must be the best!!! He had worn out his old Bose headphones!"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-04,Meh,"For the price, I expected a lot more. What do you really need 10 levels of noise cancellation for? I might make s difference if it could actually filter out voices, but it can't. It can only filter continuous constant frequencies."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2020-01-04,"Good noise cancellation, sound, and exceptional call quality","Have had these for a week and thus far, they are doing well for me both for home use and work use. Good noise cancellation and are exceptional at making calls. I have tried connecting them to a couple items (PS4 and laptop) and the microphone has some issues being picked up, but not what I purchased them for. Overall, would highly recommend for noise cancellation and sound quality, especially in work environment (work in an office that has many cubicals) and are amazing for making phone calls."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,Excellent Noise Cancelling.,"Best Noise Cancelling Headphones I have ever had. It's so good that it is dangerous to activate the noise cancelling highest level (10) if you are taking a walk on a busy road for example. Best to activate this level only in a controlled environment (e.g. on a plane, your home or office (if you are alone)). Call quality is really good as well. Sound quality is good but not the best I have heard. Bass quality is okay for me. Not the best I have heard as well but it's there. However, it can be better. Overall, I really like the headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,Solution to open plan office noise,It is the only thing that can block out annoying co-workers in an open plan office. Very comfortable.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-05,Really performed up to expectations,Really like the product. Only complaint I have is the headphone is a bit uncomfortable on the top of the head. Very sturdy connection between the two ear cups but just slightly uncomfortable. Would be nice if you could charge the battery and listen but the battery life seems pretty good so far. Not disappointed in the purchase.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-05,Simply the best headphones I have ever owned,"The noise cancellation on these is superlative. Other noise cancelling headphones I have used seem to have seasons, where the effect dulls and can interfere with the audio. I have had no issues with that. At my office the air circulation system can be removed from my listening! The construction of the product is extremely high. The frame of the headphones is sculpted and solid, with generous padding for the crown of the head. The cans glide along the ends for a fit, but stay in place, really nice. These are also the first headphones I have owned where the bluetooth connects to my phone and laptop at the same time. This reduces the tedium of swapping what I connect to. There are some downsides to the product. The solidity of the headphones means they are heavy and over time can squeeze on the head. That is a tradeoff I am willing to live with. Another downside is that the cans have to be slid up the armature of the frame to fit into the pouch again. This is a small quibble, as the adjustment is so smooth but solid. I have not messed with the app much and the touch controls. I turn the phones on with the bluetooth button, tweak noise cancellation with the left button, and then turn off. So far I have not found the app and registration any big turnoff or privacy invasion."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,Slick n comfortable,Best noise cancelling out there
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,They really work well!,They work well and have a great design.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-05,Bose 700,Touch sensors are hard to work
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-06,Good,"Overall been a pleasant experience. These are solid headphones, and really light, so I can wear them all day. Feels very sturdy, and lead me to buy other Bose products."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-06,"Purchased for voice calls, and it is awesome","I'm in a noisy office space and I'm on conference calls most of the day, so I was looking for a headset that works well as a communication headset, and also has great noise cancellation. Admittedly, the last time I used a noise cancellation headset was more than 10 years ago - but this Bose 700 is amazing. Crystal clear audio and fantastic noise cancellation. I would recommend!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-06,The best out there right now,"I’ve tried just about every of wireless headphones. I’ve had ziks, and bose, and beats and any other kind you can name and these are by far the best. They are also the best Bose has put out."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-06,Noise cancelling,"The noise cancellation is amazing, try it during a flight!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-06,"Superb Bose sound, very comfortable!","I really enjoy these! Noise cancelling is very good, Bose sound as always is superb. I needed something for work that was wire free and let me hear outside environment noise in case someone needed to talk to me. I've tried the other top brands and these edged out all the others plus they are comfortable enough for a 6- 8 hour wear."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-06,Performs as advertised,"I'm pleased with the performance and comfort of this product. The noise cancellation is better than my last purchase of this brand of headphones (now several years ago), and I feel it is a good value for the (admittedly high) dollar. This is a premium product with a premium price tag, but it provides a premium user experience, and I would (will) make this investment again in the future."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-07,Good noise canceling.,"Good product, it sounds like the old one Qc35 but NC is very good."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-07,Best buy,Bought for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loves them!
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-08,"Best Noise Cancelling Headphones for Rock, Classical, not pop or rap","I received a pair of these Bose 700's for Christmas and I am really thrilled. After comparing them to the Sony 1000xm3 as well as a few other competitors, the 700's are the best for me. But I can see how they might not be the best for everyone. Build Quality
They feel very high quality. Having a metallic chassis rather than plastic really sets them apart and makes them feel durable and professional. Comfort
These are as comfortable as any pair I have tried. What sets Bose apart is that the pad completely surrounds my ear rather than presses on your ear. I also feel like this gives it a more immersive sound because the sound feels more around you rather than directed at you. Noise Cancelling
As far as I could tell, trying these in a noisy store, the noise cancelling is every bit as good as the Sony. They are very similar. Both the Bose and the Sony were better than any other brand in the store. Sound Quality
This is where this review becomes subjective. I have read plenty of reviews that say that the Sony is better. My perception is that the 700's are more articulate and defined. Every nuance becomes apparent with these headphones. Not that the Sony sound muffled, they just aren't as unbelievably clear. The Sony get less and less articulate with more volume too. I believe that if you listen to Rock, Classic Rock or Classical, the Bose might be the best choice. They just sound so good in music that demands articulation. On the other hand, the Sony definitely has a louder sounding Bass. If you listen to pop, rap or EDM, the Sony might be the way to go if you really want a loud Bass sound. This is not to say that the Bose have no Bass, in fact, the Bose seem to have plenty for me, but the Bass on the Sony was just more present. I am very happy with the Bose 700's. It was a gift, so I didn't choose them myself, but after comparing in the store, I am very happy with the Bose and would spend my money on them rather than the Sony's if I had a choice."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-08,Great as usual,Good quality as usual from Bose.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-08,The Rumors are true!,"This product looks and sounds like a prototype , or at least it was rushed. This would be my third Bose item, but I had to return it : 1) It took me 3 hours and a lot of online reading to finally update the firmware right after I unboxed the headphones. It Kept on "" installation update "" endlessly. When I finally went to the Bose updater ,then they told me that I couldn't use Safari ; so Chrome was needed. 2) The ''one size ear pad fits all "" is a no-go. For a premium item choices are important
3) Noise cancelling is decent only for continuous low frequency sound. Other than that I did not notice any difference. 4) Music I have been enjoying ,all of the sudden, became muffled. I wanted silence I got an uncomfortable humming background ( that's my best description of the listening experience)
5) For such a price and a compromised item, including the charging case would be deal breaker. Overall, I was ready to pay the overpriced (400 bucks plus 25 taxes ) fee and I expected mind blowing experience. The Bose NC 700 has too many flaws. I guess that' s what happens when a company stops innovating and just trying hard to follow the trend instead of leading the pack. From an average Joe."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-08,Overall Great Investment! Defiantly will stick with Bose!,"These headphones are astonishing! I was in need of an upgrade because the first generation beats solo were just not cutting it for me and all I have to say is wow! They are crisper than a freshly picked apple! I bought a Bose Bluetooth speaker 4 years ago and it is still working like I just bought it. Bose has gone above and beyond my expectations and I would defiantly recommend these headphones even if you are a little lenient. One thing that I have to comment on though is that usually I get my Amazon products daily fast but this time when I ordered these it took closer to 2 weeks. I did order them around the holiday season though so maybe they will be faster at shipping now. Overall, you get every dollar you pay for!"
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-01-08,Best to buy the last year's model (QC35),"Bose kinda ""screwed the pooch"" on these updated units. Little gripes like sound like LOUD sound effects on the on/off commands and the touch sensitive swiping are just not worth it. The QC35 headphones are $50 cheaper, have tactile mechanical controls and seem to have a better microphone."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-08,Good quality,The headphones you will want to have on plane
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-08,Perfect for the airplane!!!,"A bit bulky for the gym, but perfect when you're strolling or on a plane! Sound quality is amazing and can be used with your phone as well! Best gift ever! My husband bought me a pair for my birthday and I bought him a pair for Christmas because I loved them so much!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-08,Awesome,Awesome
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-08,Headphone was a hit!,This was a gift for my son and he has been extremely satisfied with it. He likes the external sound filters and the fact that it can be used over hearing aids.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-09,Amazing,Tried them all these are the best. Especially the fit over ear for long flight. Don’t waist time on the others.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-09,Very Good value,"Glad I upgraded to these, they are awesome."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-10,Sound,"Amazing sound, well worth the price"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-10,Great Quality,Best headphones I’ve had in a while. Not great for working out with them on.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-11,Best Yet!!,I’ve had Beats and Bose these are the best yet!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-11,Just and excellent head set,These headphones are what they say excellent sound and love the idea that noise canceling my music sounds excellent
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-12,AMAZING,Switched to this from the Bose Quiet Comfort...didn’t think Bose could do any better than the QC...but they did
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-12,Great quality,Great product my boyfriend loves them
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-12,Perfect for those of us who can’t hear well,Works great
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-12,Worth the money,Exactly as described.. These headphones are awesome.. Worth every penny
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-12,Poor sound quality,Sound quality is not very good. Expected more from Bose. Gave to my husband for Christmas.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-13,Husband approved,"My husband loves these headphones for noise cancelling, comfort and sound. He said all three categories are great"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-13,Wayyyy better than beats by dre,There is this rattling in the ear cup when I play music. I’m not sure Why that is. It can get pretty annoying. There is not rattling If you are only using the noise cancellation
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-13,Quality upgrade from the quiet comfort II,The adjustable noise canceling is awesome. Very comfortable. Great sound.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-13,N/a,Alexa doesn’t link up unless hit the button..
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-14,Out of this world awesome!,You're the best I always wanted some I have them now and I'm so happy!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-14,The best all in one.,"Great sound, great noise cancelling and superb for calls. The perfect headphone for work, play and music and videos all in one."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-15,GREAT pair of headphones!,"At first, the price made me skeptical, and so did the reviews about the app. I've been looking at these for quite some time, and finally bought some for myself now that I am in college and saved up some money from my semester off. PROS:
The app has improved in quality tenfold over what the top review mentions. It instantly paired my headphones and the adjustable noise cancelling is great. My favorite feature is the touch controls. On the side of the right earphone, you can double tap to pause, swipe left/right to skip/go back, and swipe up/down for volume controls. Very cool feature! The sound quality is great. It's Bose, not much more to put here
CONS
Some songs that overdo it on bass don't translate too well at louder volumes. Not much of an issue as those songs usually aren't worth listening to anyway. Overall a great product! Very happy with them so far."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-15,Top quality.,Outstanding product and fantastic design. These are the real deal. Super comfortable an very intuitive touch controls.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-15,"Muy bueno, me encanto.","Excelente headphones, lo único que falta es que la app funcione para Windows también."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-15,Superior and Simple,"My first pair of noise cancelling headphones, I am very impressed with the quality of the physical design as well as its sound."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-16,nice headphones,Bought these for my hubby and he loves them
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-16,Perfect,Five stars
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-16,DO NOT BUY,"I brought this product because I loved Bose thru out the years. And I had to go out my way with the little time I have thru out my day to return these. I brought a pair of Sony’s and they been great. The fact that I had to Pay 430 dollar headphones for I can use NC and I have at the highest level and I still hear people talking like I have it at low volume is ridiculous. The NC was great first few day’s then it seems like it died down. I ultimately had to return these after they didn’t stop making dog whistling noises nonstop. I got my refund thanks to amazon will never buy Bose again. Keep in mind, I had these headphones in a barracks locker never fell, wet nothing. Fully charged always. DO NOT BUY"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-16,Outstanding,It beats the previous ones I had with a cord. They sync easy with any blue tooth device. I travel a lot and noise cancellation at airport and on plane is great.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-01-16,"This piece of junk broke the first time i used it, electronics failure","While using in cable mode on a flight, the unit just stopped working. Noise cancellation would work, but no sound. You have to load and fiddle with too many apps to make this thing work. Very disappointing as past products from Bose were pretty good. Hi tech junk, probably made in China"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-01-16,Heavy and terrible case,"I switched from the older QC15s, and have been somewhat disappointed with the 700s
My biggest gripe is the case which does not have ample room to hold the two prong adapter, charger, and audio cable. The case design is severely flawed in this regard which is obnoxious seeing as how prior cases got it much more right. It’s very difficult to pack those items without them falling out of the section that holds them. My other complaint is that the headphones could stand to lose a little weight. Not much needed but they are noticeably heavier than the qc15s and it does create some discomfort after a while. I deducted one star for each of these issues. Otherwise headphones sound great. Most new features, though, I find unnecessary."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-17,Long battery life,"Pretty good headphones, noise canceling works great, sound quality is good, almost no bass though. Great battery life, so if that's what you want I would recommend these."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-18,Just About Perfect in All Ways,"When it comes to audio, I prefer over the ear headphones versus on-ear or buds. Not only will you get noise cancellation options, but the audio always seems to be better. I've tried several of the most recent headphones and most are quite good offering great sound and features. But something about the Bose 700 pushes it over the top. Setup and Pairing the Bose 700 is very easy. You can download the optional Bose app for your phone if you would like a little more granular control. Couldn't be easier. Let me jump right into the two most important things for me. Noise Cancellation and count quality. Let me say that both are the best I've had. Coming from the Surface Headphones (which are underrated by the way), I believe that the noise cancellation is by far the best I've experienced. It truly blocks out sound better than any other brand I've tested. And the sound quality is very rich. I am a huge RUSH fan and I can say the bass comes out crystal clean and you can hear it over the combined guitar and drums. And when listening to STEELY DAN, you can hear everything that those grueling recording sessions required of the band. Sounds like you are bathed in music. The features and accessories are quote nice. I love having not only Alexa options but Google Assistant. This makes these very flexible headphones. I've always preferred BOSE ""Audio OS"" over other brands. The satisfying ""Connected To Your Phone"" is just a comforting and reliable experience. Rarely do I have to go back and manually pair my device. Phone calls come out clear for both parties. No one can ever guess I am on headphones. And I love the carrying bag that comes included with these headphones. The Bose 700 have won me over. From feature set to what I believe are industry leading sound quality and noise cancellation. I without a doubt recommend these."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-18,Xmas present,Love them
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-19,Great headphones,Best headphones I have owed
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-19,Sony XMR vs Bose 700,"I couldn't decide between the Sony WH1000XM3 and Bose ANC 700 headphones so I got a pair of each and tested each for a month before deciding which I liked best. I also briefly tested a pair of Skullcandy Crushers and while those were fun for a short while, they're not in the same category as these two. Background
I was coming off using a pair of Beats Wireless Studio 3 for a few years and was tired of constantly replacing parts to keep those working. I had to replace the headband twice and the ear muffs once within three years. My testing was mostly conducted while paired to a Galaxy S9 with additional testing from a Macbook and a Fire TV. I listen to a wide-range of music from hip-hop, R&B, rock, indie electro/pop, blues, and jazz. I also occasionally listen to podcasts and tested with Netflix/YouTube content. Summary (Winner: Bose...by a hair)
Can these two headphones make a baby? I don't consider myself indecisive but choosing between these two was very difficult. My heart wanted the Sony's but my brain wanted the Bose. I don't think you can go wrong with either one. Both do things very well and have some room for improvement. I found the Sony's to be more comfortable and have better audio quality. I love that they can fold and how lightweight they are. Their case is great and I love that they stayed with the 3.5 mm jack for when you need it. But I just couldn't overlook the fact that they cannot pair multiple devices at the same time. It's a feature that I use almost every day and in the end, I chose the convenience that the Bose headphones provide. The Bose are just simpler to use. They're faster to turn on. They're faster to pair new devices. And they seamlessly connect to and switch between multiple devices. Overall, their design is top-notch. The other factors were so close that the ability to pair multiple devices was the deciding factor for me. I considered waiting to see if Sony would release another pair soon but it seems like headphone models are released once every three years or so and we're only one year into the XM3s. Sound Quality (Winner: Sony)
Out of the box, I had a difficult time picking a clear-cut winner in terms of audio quality. I'm not an audiophile but I tried my hardest to distinguish the differences between the two and ultimately felt it was a wash. If I would have tried these blindfolded, I don't think I could have told which was which judging solely by the audio quality. That being said, Sony is better for one important reason: they let you customize the sound profile through the equalizer in their app. Again, I'm not an expert but I played around with the EQ sliders to optimize the sound to my liking and from that point on, I had a hard time putting the Sony's down. A knock I had on both of these headphones was the lack of bass (especially since I listen to hip-hop). However, the Sony's have the bass...they're just not configured for it out of the box. Noise Canceling (Winner: Tie)
Just like the sound quality, I found both of these devices to have equally superior noise canceling. I tested them back and forth under the same situations and couldn't decipher a significant difference. I even looked up some frequency test videos on YouTube and while Sony performed slightly better, it was negligible. I noticed that the Bose tended to perform better in windy conditions while I was out walking though. The Sony's have a separate mode for wind reduction that performed well but you have to go into the app and change your noise-cancelling profile while the Bose just worked in all conditions. Overall, I think both do a fantastic job of noise-canceling. Especially since I'm coming from using Beats which had no active noise-canceling. Both of these knock it out of the park. Call Quality (Winner: Bose)
I tested call quality over several phone calls to different people and the consensus was clear: Bose is superior. I tested while walking in busy downtown streets and in the quiet of my home and under all circumstances, I was always told I sounded better while using the Bose. Callers on the other end sounded fine to me on both headsets and both give you the option to control how much of your voice you hear and how much ambient noise you hear. Comfort (Winner: Sony)
This will be subjective but I found the Sony's to be more comfortable. The earmuffs are a traditional foam-based earmuff wrapped in a premium leather and there wasn't a lot of pressure put on my ear. They felt very good to put on and wear. I wore these for 4-5 hours consecutively on several occasions and they were mostly fine. One or two times I started getting ear-fatigue and soreness and had to take them off but it wasn't too bad. I was excited to try the Bose because I found their old QC35 to be very comfortable. Unfortunately, they made some changes that compromised the comfort. The earmuffs feel more firm and almost rubbery. Maybe this will translate to better durability and a longer lifetime but time will tell. As for now, they're just not as comfortable as the Sony's are. They create a good seal but it grips to my skin behind my ear and creates an uncomfortable friction. I find myself needing to take more breaks with these headphones in comparison to the Sony's. Design (Winner: Tie)
Both of these have pros/cons in terms of their build quality. The Bose feel more premium while the Sony's feel more plasticky. The Sony's aesthetic design, however, is great with their microphone appearance and use of gold accent colors. The Sony's can also fold for portability/storage while the Bose can't. The Bose adjust by moving the ear cup along the headband instead of extending the ear cup like Sony and most other headphones do. I'm not sure if that's the reason Bose decided against the folding design but I value the ability the fold/store the headphones more than how you adjust them. Each headphone also rotates their ear cups in opposite directions. When you have the headphones around your neck, the Sony's ear cups rotate towards your body while the Bose rotate outwards. As a result, if you take your headphones off and place them around your neck while audio is still playing, the Bose will leak more sound out towards someone in front of you whereas the Sony's would direct that sound towards your neck/chest area. However, when you're taking the Sony headphones off and placing down on a table in front of you, you have to turn them upside down whereas you can grab the Bose headphones and place them down directly in front of you with the ear cups facing down towards the table. It's hard to explain but it was somewhat annoying on the Sony's. I'd call it a wash though because, in my opinion, Sony does a better job when it's around your neck but the Bose is easier to put down or pick up. The Sony's have two buttons: one for power/Bluetooth and another for noise-canceling/voice assistant. The Bose have three buttons: power/Bluetooth, and then they dedicate a button to noise-canceling and another to the voice assistance of your choice. I thought I'd appreciate the simplicity of Sony's button design but quickly found Bose had done a much better job. Not only is it nice to have separate buttons for noise-canceling and your voice assistant, but the feel of the buttons and how you interact with them is much better on Bose. It may seem like a nitpick but on the Sony's, you have to hold the power button down for several seconds to turn it on and off whereas on the Bose, you just tap the button and you're up and running right away. Additionally, if you want to pair a new device to the Sony's, you have to hold that power/Bluetooth button for long time (maybe 7-8 seconds). In comparison, the Bose takes about one second to go into pairing mode. In fact, I'm pretty sure you can get the Bose in pairing mode before you can even turn on the Sony's. This may not seem important but it ended making a significant difference for me, especially when you consider that the Sony cannot pair with more than one device at a time but I'll discuss that in more depth in the Functionality section. One final thing I'll add about the buttons is that the Bose button placement isn't ideal. Naturally, I'd find myself accidentally placing my fingers over the buttons and clicking them when I grabbed the headphones to put them on or take them off. It's ironic because if Bose had better button placement or if you had to hold them down like you do on the Sony's, this wouldn't be a problem. Nonetheless, I prefer the Bose design and will probably learn to grab them differently with time. One final thing I want to call out in the design is Bose's use of a 2.5 mm jack. Sure this is visually appealing by occupying a smaller space but who wants to carry around a 2.5 mm adapter or look for one when they're traveling? Sony gets the points in this department by being normal and using a 3.5 mm jack. Functionality (Winner: Bose)
Functionality definitely goes to Bose. Bose lets you simultaneously pair two devices while Sony can only connect to one device. I listen to music on my phone on my way to work and then switch to listening from my laptop. And when I leave work, I switch back to my phone. When I get home, I'll occasionally pair the headphones with my Fire TV. This functionality is absolutely seamless with Bose. It'll automatically connect to my laptop when I get to work. I can then pause music on my phone and start playing music from my laptop and I'm good to go. That's it. Just pause your audio on one device and you can immediately play audio from another device. On the Sony's? Forget about it. You can only connect one device at a time for audio (you can connect a second device but only for phone calls). Remember when I talked about having to hold down the Bluetooth button for 7-8 seconds on the Sony's? That got annoying very fast. When I would get to work, I would have to go into my phone settings and turn the Bluetooth off and then go into my laptop and manually connect it to the Sony's. Alternatively, I could leave the Sony's paired to my phone and then hold the pairing button down for 7-8 seconds and then manually connect my laptop. This was so annoying. What annoys me most about this is that Bose has had this same functionality on the QC35 that was released in 2016!!! Sony didn't release these headphones until Dec 2018/Jan 2019. Why they overlooked this is beyond me. I also enjoy that Bose announces the name of the device it pairs to so I could easily tell when I'm paired to my phone, laptop, or Fire TV. The Sony's just announce that they paired to a device but you don't have context about which device. Another thing that Bose did better is the touch control on the ear cup. I thought Sony would have the edge because they have a bigger surface area to work with but in practice, it didn't help. They both function very similarly but the biggest difference is how you control the volume. On the Sony's, you have to swipe up/down once to get the volume to increment by +/- 1. That means if the volume is all the way down and you want to turn it all the way up, you have to swipe up however many times it takes to get there (maybe 10 times). By contrast, the volume control on the Bose headphones operate as a slider so one swipe can take me as far as I want to go. The Bose headphones have a smaller surface area for touch control because the headband comes down the middle and you only get to use the front half of the ear cup. However, I found that the headband acted as a good tactile reference point and my swipes were more accurate. I'm not sure if that's because I was more accurate or if it's because Bose recognized my swipes better but regardless, I had a better experience with touch controls on the Bose. One final thing I want to call out is how you temporarily stop noise-cancellation. On the Sony's, as long as you place your hand over the ear cup, it'll pause your audio and turn the noise-canceling down to allow you to carry a conversation without removing the headphones. I thought this was really cool until I learned how Bose accomplishes this. On the Bose headphones, you can hold down the dedicated noise-canceling button for about a second and it'll do the same thing. The benefit of the Bose is you don't have to keep your hand held to the ear cup so you effectively have both hands to use as you wish. When you're finished and ready to resume your audio and full noise-canceling, just tap the noise-canceling button again. Bose really nailed the convenience/practicality features. Kudos. App (Winner: Sony)
This one is a no-brainer. Bose has a clean and simple to use app but that simplicity comes at a cost. Sony on the other hand features a ton of customization options without compromising simplicity and usability. Like I mentioned before, the Sony app lets you customize the EQ and even save multiple custom profiles in addition to the pre-set profiles they provide. Sony's app also let you control the sound stage and can even dynamically control the noise-canceling and ambient noise by detecting your activity (walking, sitting, etc). I found myself rarely ever using the Bose app but I would spend time exploring the Sony features and configuring it just how I liked it. Sony takes this one easily. Accessories (Winner: Sony)
I'm actually not someone who uses the provided cases all that much but I must say that Sony's case is gorgeous. The fabric looks and feels fantastic and it made me want to use it. On the other hand, the Bose case is black leather and looked like a case you'd find with a pair of $10 wired headphones. I do appreciate the storage compartment inside the Bose case and the use of magnets to keep that compartment closed but the overall look and feel of the case is not something I liked all that much. Not a big deal either way for me but just my two cents..."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-19,Awesome,"Love, Love, Love Love my headphones"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-20,great quality,exceeded my expectations
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-20,Light weight,The new design is sleek and light weight. The external controls are an added bonus.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-20,Bose,One of the best Bose headphones ever!
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-20,Overall beats Sony,"Deal breaker -- the Sony xm3 makes my (inner) ear overheat within 4 or 5 minutes. TERRIBLY! aughh...aweful. Whereas the Bose 700 makes my ear overheat after 15 minutes or not at all. Probably depends on environment, etc.
Both overheat if I'm working out, but Bose takes much much longer. Bose DOES have a major problem -- the band that goes over the head PRESSES down. AUGHHGHGHH!!! I wore it for 30 or 60 minutes and had a sore top-of-head !! For some people this is a deal breaker. Others don't seem to notice. I DEFINITELY do. I experimented and came up with a few fixes. 1. I normally just wear a ball cap. The dome of the cap is a bit stiff, and holds the headphones away from crown of head. This cap domes up a bit, where there is a 1/2 inch of air between cap and head. Perfect. 2. I do make sure to extend the sliders on each side of headphones to almost max, to maximize distance between 700';s and top of head. but carefully...if it's too far, it will not be comfortable either. 3. For a while, I crammed rubber bands into the part where the piece of metal slides down into the ear cups (i.e., insert rubber bands from top of this). The effect is to make sure the ear pieces remain as parallel as possible to each other (and to side of your head). BECAUSE -- the more they are at an angle, the more the TOP of headband collapses and presses down on head. That worked pretty well, but now i just use the ball cap. YES that all may seem like a lot of bother but....it's not really. i just wear a ball cap and I'm good to go. Once I made my choice, I realized the other unique feature of Bose 700 is actually REALLY handy - the ability to make receive or calls while wearing them. it is REALLY handy to just answer a call in a noisy gym and the other person hears me as clear as bell, and does NOT hear the noisy gym.. really handy. Admittedly, if I'd chosen the Sony xm3's, which have almost unusable call abilities (so I'm told...I did not test this )....well, I can always answer the call and say 'just aminute, I need to leave the gym so i can hear you'. Not a big deal. However...having the Bose 700's...I do love the ability to make calls. sounds so good....
one last thing....The slgihtly tighter and deeper bass on the sony's is NOT that big a deal. 1. Sony sounds not nearly as good in themidrange, which matters much more -- that's vocals, etc!! 2. Once the music is going, Bass on the BOSE is just fine. 3. EQ can pump up the bass if needed. the eq on the bose is a good. Where as....the eq on the sony is not very natural sounding, and it all sounds artificial after a while. must be the eq curves or something. In fact....to make the sony's sound good, I had to eq them quite a bit....so, they sounded balanced but... ARTIFICIAL! Yuck ! imo the BOSE's require much less eq and therefore sound much for natural. One last thing... the bose do have a handy feature where you tap a button and get to alternate between 10 (max noise cancelling), 5, and 0 (none). (these levels are customizable.). this is a handy feature-- can tap to hear more enfvironment at will. also can remove an ear cup, but the ability to hear just a bit more stewardess, but not ALL the plane is handy. same goes for some gym situations. Recommended. - PTPGR"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-20,Just buy them!,Great in all ways!
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-01-21,Beware! Does not support music/audio sharing.,"Deceiving marketing. In the product comparison in the Amazon page Bose compares this headphones vs the QC35, they never mentioned that they aren’t capable for music sharing as most Bose wireless headsets does. I’m very disappointed Bose has done this. I have QC15, 35II. The later an improvement over the QC15 being wireless and capable to share music and audio. You would think the next product will just be better, but don’t. Besides the sleek exterior design NC700, are a step back. Wish I have check all reviews in detail to discover they can’t share music. I just saw them at the store and ordered them. I have lost my faith in Bose."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-21,Bose is Bose!,Very high quality as always. Meets expectations for sound and Alexa is a nice addition.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-21,"Good sound, poor comfort","The sound and noise cancellation are great, but I don’t think they’re comfortable. The band makes the top of my head hurt."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-21,Buy with confidence,Easy to use
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-22,Top of the Line...for any age!!!,"The sound - or lack thereof- is amazing. I am not a techie person, but I soon had everything down. They are amazing!"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-01-23,"Great for phone calls, otherwise unimpressive and some functions half-baked","The design is beautiful and the fit is great and comfortable, even when used for many hours. I need to extend ear pieces all the way and push them back for folding. The mechanism has some resistance, not sure how long it will hold up. Sound and voice pickup for phone calls are outstanding and, together with noise cancelling, improve focus on the calls. However, for music the sound is flat and almost tinny. Battery life is shorter than advertised. On a long flight to Australia I had to charge, realizing that the headphones cannot be used while charging. Once the USB C connection is plugged in, headphones turn off. Even the wired connection doesn't work. Maybe the headphones expect audio stream through the USB C connection ? This is a disappointing decision by Bose. The button that allows conversations is hard to find when quick responses are needed. Also, Bose was conservative and stayed with an outdated Bluetooth codec with high compression. Most competitors accept aptX or LDAC lossless codecs. Noise cancellation of droning noise is impressive as always with Bose (Please, Bose, please develop cancellation option for screaming babies !). Altogether, these are an improvement over the QC35, but with annoying negatives. The newest Sony or Sennheiser models are cheaper and have better technologies in certain areas."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-23,Noise Canceling / Calling - Huge Improvement - New (worse) app and no music sharing - big set back,I owned a pair of BOSE QC2 and decided to purchase these and give my QC2 to my wife so we can do music share. Not only do the new pair of 700 not have music sharing. There’s a new app all together and it’s worse than the original. I wouldn’t have bought these for the price. I cannot recommend given these issues.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-24,I've always enjoyed Bose headphones... these are no exception,"Bose has the most comfortable headphones I've ever tried. These are a ""little"" more snug than my other headsets, but it makes sense. They're a tiny bit heavier than my non-noise cancelling ones. I love the sound (or silence) they provide. :)"
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-24,Bose just lost me as a customer,"I've used QC35 II for years. I like them a lot. The sounds quality of the 700s is just slightly better than the QC35. The 700s are somewhat less comfortable than the QC35, though reviewers say they take some time to break in. Like others, I don't like giving email contact information and Bose forcing me to use its app to use my $400 headphones--the Bose requirements to upgrade. Welcome to emails for life from Bose! But when I went to charge the thing, I found that the 700s uses a proprietary charging cable. The whole experience was slightly irritating. Having to tote ANOTHER cable around with me to charge these things (not to mention needing to buy another one from Bose when I eventually lose it), was just enough to convince me it's time to try the Sonys (or stick with my QC35s, which are still going strong). The difference isn't significant, and for $400, I should feel elated with the choice, which I don't. Apple can get away with this kind of crap because their product is a ""can't do without it"" kind of product. These 700s aren't that good. I am going to return them."

Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-26,Adjustable NC increases possibilities!,This my first pair of noise canceling headphones and I couldn’t be happier! The flexibility to adjust the NC level works great - keep it low to hear things around you or turn it high to block everything out. My daughter plays club volleyball and the noise at a tournament can become unbearable after 7 or 8 hours. These headphones have literally helped me maintain my sanity in some extremely loud complexes. Another great product from Bose.

Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-28,Great noise cancelling headphones.,"I got these as a gift from my wife and son, to help in a noisy office. They perform exactly as needed. The noise cancelling Mic works great. It only pics up my voice and not the surrounding chatter. The app on my phone rarely connects so I cannot visually see the battery life left. The automted voice is difficult to understand as well."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-28,Superior Sound Cancellation but odd feel on head.,The way these sit on my head feels almost backwards... as if they put the earcups on 180 degrees backwards. In fact wearing them backwards feels more natural but the buttons are now not convenient The sound cancellation is the best I've experienced yet and the integration with Alexa is awesone!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-28,Bose > Sony,I wish I could give more than 5 stars! I had the 3 year old version of these and lost them. It’s crazy how much the technology has advanced in the last three years. I debated between Bose vs Sony. Happy I went with Bose.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-01-28,"Not impressed, there are better options out there","Pros:
- Bass sounds good even when active noise cancellation is on. - Sleek design and easy to remember controls. - Constant support in updates for software in Bose app
- USB-C charging port. - Relatively quick charging. Cons:
- Using the headphones and trying to skip songs outside in the cold is a hit or miss. - There is no AptX so your audio quality is compressed and quality is lost significantly. - Audio can sound muddy if you use Apple EQ Presets. - A lot of bugs and connection issues. I was an early adopter for these headphones a while back, I used them on 3 flights and had to return them because of problems I had with the headphones. Bringing these to the gym? Bring a towel, your ears will get so sweaty and makes the headphones slippery. Going running with these? When ANC is activated, you will hear your feet stomping on the floor or the treadmill. These headphones are not made for active lifestyles, they're made for traveling and casual listening. The build quality is great but you can tell where Bose cut corners to make their product cheaper. The ear cups were comfortable and great for those long flights but I think Bose has never had the problem of uncomfortable ear cups. I would recommend you wait for another adaptation of these headphones from Bose that actually compete with other better alternatives out there or at least consider problems I have/and other people have had to better fit these headphones into your lifestyle. I expected better from Bose."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-30,Little Did I Know...,"I have a fear of flying and I've never slept on a plane because of this fear. Seat belt is always on and even on a trip from Dallas to Germany I didn't unbuckle my belt. Then I bought the Bose NC 700, what a game-changer for me. The noise of the plane disappears, I closed my eyes the sleep came. They're a bit pricey but well worth the money, just jump in and make the purchase because you will not regret the decision."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-30,Noise Cancelling Heaphones Are Difficult to Use,"I bought these as an upgrade to my Bose QC-35 phones that I had 3 years and loved. Thought they were going bad. Decided to try the Bluetooth feature with these phone and was hoping for a convenient wireless set. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and returned. Here's why:
1. Buttons on the phones are very tiny and almost impossible to use or feel in the dark. 2. Difficult to connect to my Samsung android tablet. Sometimes connected, other times not. Very inconsistent. 3. Noics cancelling levels are nice, but rather than put a switch on the phones, this had to be activated by using your phone or tablet. I found that very inconvenient. 4. Battery is built in and had to be charged using a 2.5 to 3.5 mm cable (included.) If it goes bad, then I think you have to get the battery replaced at a service center. I found it an annoyance. 5. Volume control was completely non-intuitive. Had to press and swipe upward on the right ear-pad case. I couldn't tell that well if sound quality was as good or better than the QC-35s I think for the marginal improvement, I would pass on these and wait until either Bose re-engineers this model or look to another brand."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-30,Great sound quality and noise cancellation but nothing but problems,"As soon as I got these headphones they were nothing but problems and headaches right out the box no matter what I did I could not get these headphones to connect to the Bose app so I tried to using them like normal wireless headphones with my laptop even when connected to a computer the audio cuts out randomly and stutters it's extremely infuriating considering their price
Finally after immense turmoil. I got these to work as they were intended. If you plan on using these headphones for Discord or any other chat on PC You will Need Bluetooth 5.0. Not 4.0."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-30,My husband loves them,Lives up to ots its name...
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-31,Untimely I returned,"So I returned them because the ""11"" levels (since they count off a level in the description), aren't a heck of a lot better than the old QuietComfort 25's. Now for sound, oh man, the base and quality of sound in these 700's are far superior than the QC25's, but $250 more superior? Not to me. I didn't really care about Bluetooth a whole lot, but did think it would be fantastic to have while walking to school. However a cord doesn't bother me very much. So the bass is phenomenal in the 700's especially compared to the QC25. The QC 35 are ok, but like other reviews have said for Bluetooth to even pair with your device you have to have a Bose app. I find the Quiet Comfort series to be slightly more comfortable than the 700's, the 700's have a little too much force holding them against my ears. So I have returned them because they are OK but nothing seems to be too new with the noise cancelling for advertising 11 levels of noise control to block out the world around you. The 1 level the QC25 has is almost as good as level 10. I've got a toddler who runs around, a fish tank (when a little low on water), and a dog who are the real reason why I have the headphones that I still hear very similarly in all 3 headphones."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-31,Great product,Very comfortable.The controls via swiping take a while to get used to due to small area. The Bose app is a challenge at the beginning but after a couple of restarts working fine now. If you want deep thumping bass these are not for you
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-01,Great headphones,Excellent sound!! Small amount of difficulty getting Alexa to work. Highly recommend. Best headphones I’ve ever used! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-01,Excellent!!!,Excellent headphones in every way and loving design the intuitive app. Brilliant quality sound. Highly recommended and a good choice as an upgrade from my QC35ii pair.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-01,You get what you pay for...,"I bought a cheap headset, listened to it for 15 minutes and then put it back in the box. Bose is the gold standard in sound and this headphone is no exception. Exceptionally easy to use with the Bose Music app, crystal clear sound and very comfortable to wear. If you like music, don't screw around with $50 headphones, find the money and get Bose."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-01,Depth of sound!!!,Hands down best headphones ever. Each day more impressed with what I’m hearing.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-01,Glad I went for the buy.,"Gave 4 stars because I could still hear conversations and such on the plane when I didn’t have the sound on. Once the sound is on, it was great."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-01,They work great,They are awesome
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-02,Somehow even better than before!,"I’ve owned three generations of Bose noise cancelling headphones and loved them all, but these are the biggest upgrade yet. Notably, the noise cancelling and voice feedback are excellent."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-02,Great sound quality but lacks bass,Bose never disappoints.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-02,so worth the money!,"Crisp, clear perfect sound!"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-03,Sony is better,"What gives ? changing charging plug with in brand! I came off other Bose only to find the old charging plug isn’t same. I dislike the ear fit constantly adjusting
The placement of the power and other buttons are easy depressed when handling"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-03,Great headphones,I have a really big head and the headphones fit great. They also will for my 6 year olds head when he wants to use them. The sound is great and I love that you can change how sensitive you want the noise cancelation to be.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-03,Annoyingly drops iphone connection when making VOiP calls on a laptop,"Got these as a Xmas gift so have lived them for about a month now. - Noise cancellation and sound quality are great. - Design and comfort are also pretty outstanding. However...
- There was an issue when using using these ""wired"" on an airplane and the noise cancellation is turned on. There was no or very low sound and I couldn't listen to the movie. Turns out there is second volume control when in wired mode. You need to adjust by stroking the right ear cover and then they work great. You can't access it through the app. This is fine, except it's not mentioned anywhere in the Bose instructional material or in their FAQs. I had to find the solution in a online community chat room. - I also recently started to use them for phone calls at work and I am having a real issue that when I have a VOiP call on my laptop and try to use the headphones. Which was one of reasons I got them. My iPhone connection keeps waking up and then disconnecting, so I lose the call for a few seconds whilst it says ""iPhone connected...iPhone lost"" etc, despite not doing anything on my phone. This makes the headphones actually unusable as the person on the call thinks they've lost me. If I shutdown Bluetooth on my phone it works, but this of course is not a real solution and impractical. Is this really by design?? Checking some online forums I see others have this same issue. So I would not recommend these phones for anyone who thinks the dual Bluetooth connection solves a problem... because until Bose fixes this they are pretty useless for VOiP."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-04,Amazing headphones,AMAZING
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-02-04,"If you have the QC35 ii, DO NOT UPGRADE TO THIS TRASH.","So many great features lost including the switching Bluetooth devices by holding the on switch. Choppy lagging from device to device and media playback. Honestly, i expected better from Bose, especially for the price. Im going to return and continue using my QC35ii which I've NEVER had a problem with."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-04,You will hear your stuff....,Great to use at work... eliminates surrounding noises...
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-04,Great,I don’t like that the headphones aren’t collapsible otherwise I’m happy with them
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-05,Great headphones,"Compared to the Sony MK3's, Bose wins by far in the following areas: Noise cancellation effectiveness, phone call quality, overall functionality. I've listened and used the Sony's and Bose does a much better job in those areas. Sony wins (very slightly) in music quality and comfort ... just by a small margin. The case it comes with is nothing to get too excited about and I wish they included the airplane adapter (but they don't). Bose connects to 2 devices and you can move between devices easily. Overall, great quality headphones. Everything you would expect from Bose. The black is a bit hard to keep clean, but they function great and I've had no issues. They have a relatively small footprint also. The one feature I wish the Bose had was the one-handed cover up feature to allow the outside audio to pass through and the noice cancellation to pause. Sony has that feature where you put your hand on the ear cup and it allows sound through. Bose does not offer that feature (which would be handy). I use these everyday and I'm very glad I made the investment in them. Great quality."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-05,Works,Good
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-05,So close to being really good.,"I read a ton of reviews detailing many headsets of this caliber and price range and settled on the Bose as the feature to keep two devices connected really sold me. I work in an office and often list to music from my phone but occasionally need to switch to hear audio from my laptop. I previously had a pair of Bose over-ear, wired headphones that I adored until I eventually wore them apart from so much use. My expectations for these were very high. I admit that being in my 40's and listening to music far louder than I should have for more years than is probably reasonable has more than likely had an impact on my hearing. That aside I feel like I've listened to other audio sources recently that gave more depth to the sound stage. While the experience is better than the airpods I'm switching from (and truly it is quite good) I was still left expecting a little more. What disappoints me the most however are the issues I have with connectivity. I never struggle to keep a connection once it's established but the ""hot swapping"" I was so enthralled with has been finicky to say the least. I've often successfully paused audio on the phone and switched to the laptop without issue but then pausing audio on the laptop to resume on the phone leaves me with no audio. This can happen in reverse as well. Occasionally even the first ""swap"" will give no audio even when I verify through the Bose App (and that's another story all together) that I am indeed successfully connected to both devices. On very rare occasion I'll struggle to connect to a device and then once it does the sound will be very tinny. For the price of these I expect better. Overall the sound quality of the headset is quite good. It's brought new life to music I've long listened to. The noise cancelling is very impressive. In short I've enjoyed these headphones, but the connection issues with ""hot swapping"" have left me somewhat disappointed. If that's not a feature you plan on using you really shouldn't have any drawback with this headset."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-05,Eh,The headphones are great - the interface not so much. The Siri button is atrocious - 100% wish that entire feature could be eliminated. Using with two phones that are both connected through Bluetooth is rather difficult. I end up using the wire more than Bluetooth - and you cannot use noise cancellation while you have it wired. Someone over engineered these and missed the mark. Trying to make it more user friendly has made it somewhat more cumbersome to use these effectively.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-05,Excellent,"Works extremely well, easy to use, long battery life, best noise cancelling I have experienced, and great audio quality. No complaints."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-06,Great call quality.,"I very happy with these. While the noise cancellation and sound quality is not quite as good as the sony wh1000xm3, the call quality and materials far exceed what sony offers."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-06,Ok,Work good have some problems connecting with one of my Bluetooth
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-06,"Quiet the world without sacrificing the Music’s quality! Amazing sound, features & Alexa enabled!","The noise cancellation is exceptional on these headphones. With 10 levels I can block out most of what is going on around me, when it is safe to do so. If you are someone that startles easily, like myself, you will probably get scared a lot because you will not hear what or who is walking up behind you. My husband finds this very humorous. The sound quality was every bit of what I expected from Bose. Crisp, rich audio, with an amazing range of clarity, from your treble to mid tones and excellent bass. It’s easy to slip into your own little oasis with these on. They are also quite comfortable, their padded band and ear cups are soft and do not apple much pressure against your head. They are very light weight and I can wear them for hours without issue. The included case is well made, sturdy and not overly bulky allowing my to pack it and take it with me anywhere. It has a storage compartment for your cables so you always know where they are. The battery life is excellent! I can go days without charging, but if I do need to charge, they replenish quite quickly and I am right back in business. I have easily gotten a full 20 hour charge out of these. I like that when you turn them on they immediately tell you how many hours they have left on their current charge and what devices they are connected to. This makes it easy to check how long you can use them on their current charge, before you head out somewhere where you might not have access to a plug. I found the time they tell me I have left on my charge to be quite accurate. I am able to connect to more than one device (like my iPhone and iPad) and they intuitively play the sound from the device I am using at the moment. I love that feature it’s easy to switch from watching something on my iPad to listening to music from my phone. Bose also includes a cable so you can plug directly to your device and go wired. I have not used this feature because the battery life is so long, I have not run into a situation where it was necessary. The buttons and touch features of these headphones are wonderful. I can turn Alexa (Siri or Google) on or off depending on my needs. I can control the volume sliding my finger up or down on the surface of one ear and can tap to pause and swipe to change songs. With one button I can rotate between 3 levels of noise cancellation that I can set within my app. I have not had the chance to utilize some of the AR on these yet but cannot wait to try it on our next vacation, it will be like bringing along our own tour guide. I love that Alexa is built in. I’m an artist and when I’m painting in my studio it is very nice to be able to use Alexa to change my music without needing to touch my device or my headphones. I saved and waited to get these after trying them and comparing to the Sony competitive model and I am so glad I did. I found the bass of the Sony WH1000 series to be a little scratchy sounding and the overall sound just wasn’t as crisp as the Bose 700 series. I had a pair of Cowin E-7s and those, while they were great at their price point and did the job while I was saving up for these, they just weren’t even in the same class as the Bose 700. These, in my opinion (and I spent a lot of time putting headphones on and off, listening to how everything sounded on each), set the bar and everything else is just trying to measure up. Only the Sony WH1000 series could come close, but for me their sound quality still fell short. The only way to describe it was, you knew you were listening to a recording, whereas the sound from the Bose 700, you could close your eyes and it sounded like you were listening to it actually being played by the artist live the sound is just that crisp and clear no echo or scratch it’s clear vibrant and rich, everything I expected from Bose. I am very happy with my purchase, they were worth the wait and I would certainly recommend them to everyone! One Note I have very sensitive sinuses and when I put on noise canceling headphones, I can actually feel a pressure in my ears and sinus cavities, this does happen with the Bose as well (it happens with every brand I have tried if the cancellation is of any really quality). That said it does not deter me, nor do I feel it’s would be a reason I wouldn’t recommend them or give them a lower star rating. I can feel it when I activate the noise cancellation at its max level but everyone else I have asked to try them, can’t. So chances are very likely this will not be something that the average person even realizes. I can still use the noise cancellation and can block out enough that I never hear my husband walk into my studio until he taps me on the shoulder and scared the heck out of me. I only include this info in case there are others out there that also experience this, with the Bose 700 you can control the levels and it’s easy to step your way up through 10 levels of cancellation and find one that blocks the noise out, while still being comfortable to your sinuses. That is why I would recommend to everyone! Other headphones are cancellation on or off and if you are sensitive to it that can render the feature useless. Again not the case with the Bose 700 series. I use this feature all the time, have found the level that is perfect for me and the noise cancellation is amazing. It is so nice to finally be able to use this feature. I will also add that unlike other headphones the noise cancellation does not affect the quality of the sound I am listening to either! I have tried many where the sound completely changes the moment you turn it on, not with these. The sound remains crisp and rich and clear as it did without the noise cancellation. The only difference is the world around you gets quieter and the music sounds amazing! If you read this whole review Thank You if you are considering these headphones and trying to compare, in my opinion there is no comparison and I don’t think you will be disappointed choosing the Bose 700 series. I hope this info helped."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-06,Luxury Defined.,My son has these. I have Beets. His Bose ate so much better!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-06,"Superb sound, style and quality","I have never spent this much on a pair of headphones, but trust me, they are worth it! The sound is incredible, the noise cancelling works better than anything I have ever tried before, and I can't wait to try these out on an airplane. I travel a lot for work and always wanted some good noise cancelling headphones to drown out the noise. I think these might just do the trick! I love the new ""Alexa"" (Amazon) voice feature too, since I have been using this technology around the house for a few years."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-06,Awesome noise cancelling and voice calls,"It’s overall a great headphone. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes when the headphones connected to 2 devices, it constantly disconnects and reconnects every few minutes. It would be ok if I could turn off the voice that says “DISCONNECTED FROM IPHONE. RECONNECTED TO IPHONE” which silences all of the audio coming through. Other than that, noise cancelling is awesome, it’s comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and voice calls work great."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-02-06,Not usable as a bluetooth headphone on anything but ios,The bluetooth on this requires special dongles for windows machiens and intermittently disconnects from OSX. Works fine with iOS but I really feel like I wasted money on this product. I have spent about 20% of my time using it troubleshooting bluetooth connections. It's trash. I will never buy a bose product again.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-06,Noise canceling for music is great,The noise canceling could be better.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-07,Better than I imagined!,Sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation is phenomenal! Controls are easy to use once you get used to them.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-07,a very prestigious product,Sound quality is what I come to expect from bose
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-08,Outstanding sound quality,I bought these after listening to the QC35 model. There's no comparison. If you can afford it I would highly recommend the 700's
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-08,Awesome,All good ...it was a gift and the receipte loves it
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-08,Great headphones..Love the Alexa features..,Sound quality is great. Wish the apps worked a little better but still love the headphones
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-08,Great headphones,Finally a set of head phones worth the money I paid for them.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-09,Very good but not perfect,"So I went back and forth for a month between these and the Sony 1000XM3's. The decision for me came down to the ability to switch between devices without having to disconnect and reconnect the headphones to different devices. Pros:
* Able to connect to multiple devices at the same time
* Switching between devices is easy
* Touch controls are great
* Noise Cancellation is phenomenal to the point where i would close the microwave or refrigerator door and would have to double check it because i'm used to hearing the specific sound it makes when it actually closes all the way. Cons:
* The clamping force on the headphones are to high for my larger head and it can get uncomfortable if I have them on for more than an hour
* They are HOT my head sweats whenever i wear them
* When the noise cancellation is at 10 you can feel a pressure in year ears that is a bit uncomfortable at times
* The app doesn't have a built in EQ so I am unable to adjust the bass response which i would like
Overall I am relatively happy with the purchase as there is no perfect set of headphones on the market at this time and the ability to connect to multiple devices was feature number 1 for me."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-09,Bose 700 Out of Box Initial Experience,"I received my Bose 700 today. Next day Prime delivery. Unfortunately they were delivered to the house next door. I retrieved the box. The unit was manufactured in 9/2019 and arrived with firmware 1.14. Upon power up the 700 paired with no issues to my 8 Plus. After installing the Bose Music app the firmware update automatically launched. The update failed several times. I searched for the issue and found a link to the Bose site where there were instructions to connect to a computer and update using the supplied USB cable. The firmware update failed once using that method but on the 2nd attempt updated to 1.3.1. The sound quality is great, probably not audiophile quality but I purchased these to survive a noisy work environment. I needed a device that provides excellent call quality with ambient noise rejection of loud co-workers. I'm very hopeful that these will meet that objective despite the out of box firmware update issue. Firmware version 1.3.1 does have support for Siri so you do not need Google or Alexa."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-09,Top of the line.,When you want the best quality and sound; look no further.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-09,Eyeglass wearer review,Work exactly as described. Little uncomfortable after and hour if you wear glasses. Not the products fault. If I tilt my glasses down a little helps. Addicted to them. Can't get them off my head! Works great for calls both ways. Music sounds good. Buttons and swiping easy. Easy to pair 2 devices. Quick charge. Have multiple dogs muffle out the barking well for me and callers. Don't have to hide in bathroom to make calls anymore. Great buy. Worth the price. Let's face it this is a high end item.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-09,Husband LOVES them,Husband LOVES them and he’s had a few Bose headphones.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-09,Best gift ever,My husband loves these headphones.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-09,Awesome headphones,"Awesome headphones, really great sound quality, and Alexa is pretty cool."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-10,Awesome head phones,Excellent for long flights and battery life is well over 16 hours. Would definitely purchase these!!! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-11,Absolutley amazing,"I have 4 noise cancelling headphones and these are by far the best. They are light with amazing noise cancelling capabilities. But the most important part are the microphones, that make my voice sound amazing. I have always had a problem of being on finding headphones that are great for conference calls and for music, these are the only ones I have ever used that are great for both. The headphones have sliding action capabilities that I don't remember how to use, but I just end up controlling them through my iPhone. Also, check out the AR capabilities."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-11,"Great sound, superior noise cancelling","First set had issues but when I received the replacement, I love this product. App works smoothly with headset, sound quality is outstanding and when you want quiet, dial it to 10 and shut the world out. Great headphones."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-02-11,Too much mandatory data sharing with Bose Audio App,"Many of the advertised features for these headphones requires you to install the Bose Audio App. The Bose Audio App requires you to create an account and share information with Bose about stuff like what you're listening to, how long you listen, location information, gender, etc. I shouldn't be required to share personal information to gain access to all of the advertised features -- especially when the product description doesn't spell out that some of the advertised features won't work unless you install the app and share your private information. Of particular concern are sections in their policy that contain statements like ""Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or device to collect information about you... ""
Why is this required to access basic, advertised functionality for these headphones?"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-11,Great Sound,I love this product. The noise cancellation is amazing and I love the new design!
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-11,Good but needs improve stability on the head,Great product but they slide off your head easily if you bend over to far
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-12,The sound of silence,I wear glasses so not a perfect seal when I wear them. During a recent overseas trip 22+ hours in flight noise reduction is excellent battery life better than expected. Suggest Bluetooth transmitter like Airfly so you remain cordless
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-14,"Great quality, sometimes temperamental software","This product is fab for sound quality and connecting with Apple products, but sometimes has issues with consistency when switching between 3 paired devices (2 work just fine) and doesn’t ply nice with my windows computer (but I’m hesitant to say it’s the headphone’s fault and not the windows os). Overall they’re the best headphones I’ve ever had and have no regrets!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-14,I’m doing this so I don’t get fined,Excellent headphones great for any use. They sound great and are easy to use.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-02-14,Big disappointment,Slide off easily. Sound became very muffled when lean a head down.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-15,Got what I paid for,Had bought some cheaper Sony headphones trying to get decent NC for less... Ended up with little NC and less than I'd intended. Returned the Sony's and just paid for good quality head phones. Got what I paid for.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-15,Not as good as Sony and eats your hair,These headphones are good but they simply aren’t as good as the competing Sonys. The noise cancelling isn’t as good and they don’t get as loud. The design is also annoying because my hair gets stuck in it due to the sliding adjusting mechanism thing. I highly recommend people with long hair get something else if getting your strands of hair pulled on or ripped out is annoying to you.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-16,Bose doesn't Disappoint,"I love these headphones, I use them every single day and they have served me extremely well. I'm a college student and spend a lot of my time studying and listening to music. I live in a dorm and have three other roommates with desks within 5 feet of mine. Sitting and studying at my desk usually means that there is background conversation in the room or others playing music at a decent volume on their speakers. Putting these headphones on completely blocks that out. Turn noise cancellation up to ten and play music at about 50-70% volume and I can't hear a word of what anyone in the room is saying. They have started playing a game of how loud they have to say my name before I notice. They have to get very close to yelling occasionally when I am not paying attention and have the volume way up. As for the sound quality, I love it. I listen to everything from rap (heavy bass) to classical and orchestral pieces. I can confirm that the sound quality is consistent throughout genre, for some the bass may be slightly lacking but I find it to be more than enough. The Bose app is pretty much useless but it doesn't matter because all you need to do with it is set where you want your three noise cancelling levels to be and then never open the app again. The battery life is great I get the full 20 hours out of it even half a year later. One thing that I found surprisingly convenient is the included aux cord. Odd to purposely use Bluetooth headphones cabled I know but it does have its benefits. When travelling you can connect it to on board entertainment. And between when I got my Desktop computer and added bluetooth capability to it the aux cable came in handy. I love the case, granted it's slightly larger than the quiet comfort's but it's flatter which is nice. The hidden compartment is nice for housing the cables. Lastly is my only complaint about these headphones, I have a fairly large head already and big ears and yet these fit perfectly. That said the slides on either side that allow adjustability have become noticeably looser. They still work but it just means I have to readjust them to make them tighter about once every hour or two. No problem just a mild annoyance, hopefully they have fixed this in newer ones."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-16,Great for noise cancellation but lacking on bass,Just got it and my husband is still getting used to it. But so far the only thing that’s missing from his and my experience is the lack of bass. Would love if it has more bass or option to put it up or down.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-16,"Absolutely AMAZING, but for the mic","Everything about listening to music with these headphones is wonderful, even though I wish there was a bass boost. But even without, crystal clear sound and phenomenal noise cancellation make sitting back and tuning out the world around you simple and easy. The only catch with these has nothing to do but with the main function of headphones, but with the mic for when you take calls. It's TOO good. I can sit in my front room, and pick up murmurs from upstairs. Using these for calls when you are anywhere BUT a quieter environment means whomever you're talking too will not hear you, they'll hear everything around you. But since I didn't buy these to make calls, I am exceedingly happy with my purchase."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-16,Overall a great quality headphone,Does what it says it is supposed to. No issues; I do wish the noise canceling feature was a bit better.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-17,Lasts a very long time,Love these headphones
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-17,Best headphones I’ve ever had,These headphones have changed the way I think about my commute. I am able to have moments of quiet that I couldn’t have before.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-19,Nice and lightweight,"My girlfriend really likes these. They don't fully cancel out noise, rather, they damper the volume - though, you can still hear loud noises. The controls are cool and easy to use. They paired up easy with a iPhone - I'll try to pair them with my Pixel 3 XL. They are lightweight yet, seem durable. The cord could be longer but, isn't a total con. I would recommend them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-20,Superior product worth the money,Superior product - in every way
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-02-20,Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.,Game changer for talking on the phone with.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-02-21,Bluetooth is the Problem,"My husband used his Bose QC headphones to listen to classical music and for noise cancellation; so, he is familiar with Bose quality The Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700 are profoundly disappointing because even after locating instructions on the internet, adding the Bose Headphones 700 to the computer settings, updating the Headphones, and changing the battery, he has been unable to get the Bluetooth to connect. He cannot get past the ""ready to connect"" message. He has resorted to the plug-in to the computer. The sound is excellent as one would expect form Bose."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-21,Worst than the former version.,"I so prefer the former version. More comfortable to wear, uou dont need to turn it on to charge it. Take mine, give me your old ones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-22,Good quality,These were a gift.....but he says they work great.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-22,Pure quality and excellent sound,I love these. I have always been a fan favorite if Bose and these are perfect and comfortable.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-02-22,Great headphones,I had the Beats before the most 700 and hated them. The fit in these are 100 percent better. The Beats hurt my ears after about 20 mins. The microphone on the bose is by far the best out of all the headphones. The sound is awesome.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-22,The sound id perfect,I like it all
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Best Headphones,Great!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Amazing,Worth the money! Has made using other earphones disappointing. Love the ability to change the level of noise cancelling.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Superb sound!,Excellent quality!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Sound & comfort.,"Comfortable, adjustable. Noise limiting level adjustment. Great sound. Fingertip volume control."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Pricey but worth it,Amazing quality
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-23,Awesome product,Great quality
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-24,awful sound quality,"absolutely terrible sound quality, appalling how Bose is mocking it's customer's. they sound just like my 50$ 15years old headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-24,Elegant and convenient,Nice looking. Simpler to fold than my QC35. Good battery life; lasted through a 3-day trip without charging. Connects to my MacOS and iOS devices easily.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-24,Wonderful headphones that are truly great for phone calls.,"I've only had these headphones for a couple of weeks now, but I do actually love them. I do a fair number of hour-long phone calls every week for work, and these phones are much more comfortable and sound better than the AirPods I've been using. They also sound great with the music I've played on them, both through Bluetooth and through a wired connection to my old iPod classic, but I'm not at all a sophisticated audiophile, so you can take this assessment with a big grain of salt. They are easy to use, and I love that the battery life is 10 times as long as the AirPods' batteries. I did use them on a 5 hour bus ride, and the noise reduction was very real, but it wasn't total, which I had expected. But I'm new to noise reduction and I have no frame of reference with what other NR phones might do. The last thing I'll say is that the cost of these phones is quite substantial. I was drawn to them because all the reviews I saw said they were the best for phone calls, but I probably wouldn't have been able to psychologically justify paying the $400 price for them if I hadn't gotten a substantial gift card. But now that I have them, I am very glad for them!"
Bose,NC700,4,0,2020-02-25,Good Noise Cancellation and All-around Performance,"Noise cancellation is very good. And that's basically why you buy these instead of regular headphones, because you decided you need it. Sound is a bit thin to me. I don't rate them so highly on sound quality. The sound is adequate for my purposes because I only use them when I need noise cancellation, otherwise I use my other headphones with better sound quality. Comfort and stability on the head during activity is very good. The headphones are attractive by themselves but the way they sit on the head makes them less so. Bluetooth range is very good. Stability usually very good. Sometimes I have problems with pops/static, maybe from interference... not a fan of bluetooth generally, prefer wires to avoid this problem but we seem to be going away from that. I don't use Alexa. Phone calls with my Android work well. Battery life very good. Ease of use fine but it helps to master the control functions and I have trouble remembering some of the controls because I don't use them enough (and I'm an older person). If you have gray hair consider the silver model. I reflexively went with default black and later realized that silver might have looked better on me. Nice case to pack in your carry-on. I agree with complaints about the way Bose is trying to use this headphone to harvest data. You can't avoid it, and I don't like it."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2020-02-25,Best ANC headphones on the market!,"I'll keep it simple and just list the pros and cons. For reference, I've now owned these for about 6 months and use them for 6+ hours per week (depending on traffic and how many days I have to go into the office). The short version is that I love these headphones and highly recommend them to anyone. Pros:
-They are very comfortable. I have a very large head and it's hard enough finding headphones that even fit me. These have room to spare and are very comfortable to boot, unlike the popular Sony ANC headphones that are just miserable. -Sound quality is excellent. To me it sounds like there is a slight dip in the mids, but overall it's a very balanced sound. You can hear everything very clearly and the sound stage is very good. I feel like the people saying they don't have enough bass just don't know how to properly balance a sound system and have gotten used to listening to music with way too much bass. These have the perfect amount of bass, in my opinion. -Bluetooth connection is very solid. With the QC35s, I had constant brief dropouts. No dropouts at all with these. -General build quality is excellent. They feel very sturdy and I have no fear of breaking them, especially since they come with a nice hard case. -Noise cancellation is excellent. Blocks out the engine rumble of the bus or airplane and even does a decent job of lowering voices. -Battery life. I can usually go up to two weeks of commuting before I have to charge them. -No discomfort from the ANC. The QC35s gave me the feeling of pressure whenever ANC was on, but these do not. Cons:
-They are a little heavier than I would like, probably due to the metal construction. A minor complaint, but if I tilt my head forward, they will slide down. However, the weight isn't uncomfortable due to the nice padding. -When I'm on the bus and it hits a big series of bumps in the road, it sounds like the audio is cutting out. I think this is a side effect of how ANC works and I don't think the sound is actually cutting out, but it is mildly annoying. -If you try to use them in passive mode (ie wired and not turning them on), they sound pretty awful. It's clear that is not the intended use case and it's easily remedied by just turning them on, but still. -They use a 2.5mm jack for the wired connection. Comes with a cable, but if you ever lose that, it's far more annoying to find a replacement than if they had just used a standard 3.5mm jack. -The wired connection does not support headset use. That is, even if you have a TRRS headset cable (which is a chore to find in 2.5mm, by the way), you won't get the mic signal going through the cable, just audio playback. This is a missed opportunity for gamers in particular who will not want to use a laggy bluetooth connection. -Only supports AAC and SBC codecs. I actually think the SBC codec sounds good anyway and haven't had any complaints about sound quality, but considering you can get AptX support on headphones costing half as much, I think they dropped the ball here. -Price. Yes, I think they are the best ANC headphones out there, but they are nearly double the average sale price of their closest competitor and that's really asking a lot considering that they don't really offer that much more (and, in some cases, they offer less). Would be a much easier sell at $300."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-25,Auto-off issue makes this hard to recommend.,"My biggest gripe with this product is the auto-off. There are two versions of it:
* Motion auto-off. THIS ""feature"" CANNOT be TURNED OFF. The headphones turn off after (10?) minutes of no motion and no music streaming. However when napping,
meditating, or resting on a plane these will shut off with a loud noise either waking you up or disturbing your
meditation. Defeats the noise-canceling of them. * Timed off
This can be adjusted in the app. When music is not playing they will automatically turn off at a set time. However if you are on a call or using the headphone for anything besides Stereo Audio channel, then they'll
turn off at the set time instead of staying on like they should. This is a terrible oversight/bug. I have to have
them always be on and sacrifice the battery saving or have something that doesn't shutoff in the middle of a
call. This is a feature $100 airpods get right, but Bose cannot with a $400 headphone. In addition, the touch sensitive controls in favor of physical buttons really annoy me, but others might like them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-26,Initial impression: I LOVE these headphones.,"I use these headphones for the following: listening to music, tuning out a noisy environment, attending a live-online class. I have had these for almost two months and I LOVE them. I am a musician and thus, somewhat of an audiophile who appreciates refined, balanced sound. I do not care for a bass emphasis in my sound like some brands advertise. These headphones deliver high quality, balanced sound for my middle-aged ears, offer great connectivity and batteries hold their charge (20 hours). Connectivity is streamlined and quick with all my devices. I do not need to be connected to wi-fi for them to function; initially connecting via the Bose app was easy I was able to set them up quickly and Bose customer service was very quick to respond to a question I had during set-up. While I no longer use the Bose app, it was good to get them registered directly with Bose. The noise cancelling option offers 2 different levels (5 and 10)... 10 is amazing cancelling the majority of low-level, bass sounds in the environment. Sometimes I put on my favorite light music or nature sounds, close my eyes and give myself a break from everything. It's like being able to take a mini-vacation from everyday life. They are almost addicting. They are also very light-weight which my occasionally tender head and long neck appreciate. Now only time will tell how well they hold up. (I look for long-lasting quality in technology, in this world where too much waste is produced). I bought these because I trust in Bose's history of quality and reliability. (Gratefully, I still have my Bose room CD-radio player which I bought 16 years ago). I will write another update in approximately a year. Hopefully, I can report that battery life is still going strong along with everything else."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-26,Best present for a music lover!!!,I bought these for my boyfriend who travels often. He loves them and covets them like a crown jewel!!! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-26,Simply beyond compare,I immediately put these headphones to work. They were very easy to pair and switch on. I let it play my Apple Music playlists and the results we’re outstanding. Don’t bother looking for some other brand. Stick with the best.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-26,Awesome!,Easy to setup. Comfortable. Great sound.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-27,Great product from Bose,"These are the perfect headphones. Easy to use, great battery life and sounds great! I have nothing bad to say."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-27,Nuff said,What else can I say “ They are BOSE”
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-28,Amazing sound... when it works...,"After a few months having these, the bluetooth connectivity started acting up. I have followed and read several ""fixes"" on Bose support forums, and try hard to have these work properly with no success. Is just frustrating...
The sound quality is amazing, only when it works... nowadays I found myself using regular speakers to avoid the frustration of connectivity."
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-02-28,"Great hardware, very poor software","Pro's:
Very comfortable, sound is good, I actually really like the protective case it comes with, and the usb-c is nice to have. 20 hours is enough battery to get through any day while charging at night. One of my favorite design choices from bose is the angled back inside each of the ear cups that makes it feel more form fitting to the ear. They feel light while wearing them as well. Con's:
Requiring the app to use is very disappointing. It should be optional for more granular functionality, but still be able to connect to a bluetooth signal without it, like all other headphones I've ever had. This is especially bad when the app doesn't work. It constantly says its not connected when it is, and vise versa. Having it connected to two devices at the same time (an advertised feature) also did not work as it should. It said they were both connected, but only one would play. I had it connected to my phone and computer, and as long as the computer was connected, i couldn't hear anything from my phone. Then I disconnected from my computer, started listening to my phone, and then it suddenly started giving me audio notifications that it was connected to the computer over and over, with about half a second inbetween where i could hear what my phone was out putting. I have hope because all my con's are centered around the app, that they can just update it and make this a 4 star product. Fingers crossed."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-28,"Great noise reduction, subpar bluetooth performance for work","I love the noise cancellation factor (open office here) and the fact that it can pair to two bluetooth devices at the same time, however, when I connect it to my phone and my laptop, as soon as I use it for a video call, it starts disconnecting and reconnecting to the phone disrupting my call. If I turn off the connection to the phone during a call, I am then left with a dead mic, which makes no sense. I then started connecting it solely to my laptop but now have the mic suddenly stop working during meetings, which can be quite the problem. I turn it off and on and I'm good to go again, but for the price, this shouldn't be occurring at all. the only reason I'm keeping them is the noise cancellation is quite good, and if I'm just listening to music they work great. Here's hoping the next version will fix their mic and bluetooth issues."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-28,"When playing in the laptop, the pause function does not work","Overall, the Bose 700 sound quality is great. However, some functionalities draw a concern. (1) While playing music via my mac laptop, the pause function (double tap on the right earcup) does not work. It works fine if I have played the music from my IPhone. Secondly, the Bose Music App to control the input source from iPhone or laptop is so confused. Other than that, it is great product. Chau"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-28,Best looking headphone on the market and one of the best sounding,"Clean, metallic design that makes it a pleasure to use. Sound quality is as good as any other top headphone on the market. Battery life isn't great but I do like the USB-C type charging port. EDIT:
To adjust noise cancellation/additional features you need to use the bose music app and its a hassle to connect. Took me about 20 tries the first time, then it disconnected and then it took me a bunch of tries to connect again."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-01,Airplane perfect,Husband loves these
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-01,Great noise cancellation,"Love these, I am in a ""Agile"" work space and these really help."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-01,Not worth the upgrade,Not worth the $400. Stick with the Bose Q35II
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-01,BOSE,"Very nice BOSE. Unfortunately, I had to return because they are too heavy and I get headaches when wearing them. Otherwise, I loved the noise canceling on my daily commute."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-03-03,"Proprietary charging cord is a NO GO for me: small, easy to lose or misplace, & nonstandard","I have over a dozen Bose products, including three noise-canceling headphones. Unfortunately, this headphone uses a nonstandard charging cord, a proprietary cord which is small, black, and easy to misplace or lose. On a long trip cross-country, I misplaced the tiny cord and couldn't use any of my other connecting cords (the same the Amazon Kindle uses), which means the battery ran until it drained out. As Bose has used standard cords in the past, there is no advantage to using a proprietary cord for this model. In fact, like everyone else, I've got boxes of cords, all proprietary, that it's impossible to keep track of them all, and as a result they're going to get tossed, along with the products they are intended for. There's no reason to have such a bewildering array or nonstandard connections, because it needlessly complicates everything."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-03,BEST HEADPHONES EVER!!!,INCREDIBLE QUALITY! INCREDIBLE SOUND! And it blocks out all the “outside” noise! LOVED THEM!! !
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-03,Sound quality and noise canceling are excelent.,I was considering buying the wh-1000xm3 up until I realized there was a newer model of the Bose ANC 700 over the quiet comfort 35 headphones. I tried on the Sony units and the Bose 700's at best buy to do a side by side. and to me the clear winner was the Bose 700's. The bass on the Sony units made the sound muddy and the bass seemed over used. The Bose on the other hand were crystal clear by comparison. small noises in the background can be heard in the background of music and also the active noise cancellation during phone calls was a huge plus for my wife as we live in a small house. She can now watch TV at normal volume while I talk to family and friends without a lot of background noise while in the same room as the TV. Yes they are more expensive and yes the battery only holds 20 hours of charge but at the same time I don't fly to Europe or Australia either on a regular basis so 20 hours is a huge number of hours for the normal everyday user like me who listens to them about an hour or 2 a day. I only charge them about once every week and a half when I reach about 40 percent battery charge. According to some reviewers these are not studio grade headphones but then again these are not several thousand dollars and they are wireless. For my tastes the sound quality is well beyond any of my sennheiser in ear headphones or Jaybird bluebud X2 headphones in sound quality.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-03-04,DON'T BUY BOSE 700,"I really wanted these 700's to be worth the 400$ price tag. I was torn between these and the Sony WH-1000XM3. I watched numerous video reviews and determined both headphones are very equally matched. Except the price, you can easily find the Sony on sale for 250$, whereas these Bose 700 are ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS MORE. When I buy a big ticket item I generally go for the more expensive product and generally get the best quality product. NOT THE CASE with Bose 700! Within two weeks the left headphone speaker developed a constant white noise static noise associated with the ambient noise cancelation feature. Additionally, I had to remove and reinstall the Bose app 3x in two weeks due to connectivity issues. I made sure the latest update was installed on the headphones repeatedly. I also went through the complicated ""reboot"" process repeatedly. I allowed the headphones to completely discharge the battery hoping for for some sort of hard reboot. In a nutshell, I've wasted hours of my time trying to fix these brand new 400$ headphones!!! Still the constant, literal headache giving, static noise for left ear speaker. In the end, Bose offered me to send them back for a replacement, however, I'm afraid I'll get a used remanufactured set in return. I elected to request a refund from Amazon. I suppose I should consider myself lucky these headphones revealed their poor quality soon enough for me TO GET MY MONEY BACK. Shame on you Bose! If your going to price these headphones 30% MORE than your competition, they better dang well be the best and Not full of problems & headaches! !"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-04,Highly recommend!!!!,"I highly recommend the Bose 700, there great.They have 20 hours of use before needing a charge.I use them everyday.The only item that could be better is the bass.If they enhance the bass, it would be a home run. I would definitely buy another pair."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-05,Good but not great,While the head phones have an amazing auditory range the bass is lacking for over the ear head phones.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-05,"Worth the pricetag, excellent product.",Best of the three previous bose headsets I owned. Incredibly comfortable and great sound. Not including the aeroplane adaptor as standard is my only gripe. Surely there is enough margin in a $400 product to put in a $7 adapter.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-06,Great sound. Great microphone.,These headphone really improves airline travel. They also are great for phone calls. Great sound quality and and no one every complains about not being able to hear/understand me on phone calls. I've use other Bluetooth headsets and this wasn't the case. There is only one reason I didn't give 5 stars. There is an annoying clipping or clicking sound sometimes in noise cancelling mode.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-06,Great sound quality and noise cancellation feature.,Great sound and I love the noise cancellation feature!! So easy to use. I take them with me everywhere. Great product!
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-03-06,"Tried to Like it, but returned for QC35II","Bose ex-fan for 5 years. Owned QC 35II and it was the best headphones I’ve had. Decided to upgrade to NC700. After 3 product replacements, call quality in windy conditions remained horrible, ANC was just as good as the QC35II and the fit was way worse that it’s predecessor. After trying to like it for 6 months, finally returned it and downgraded back to QC35II. The QCs have a ‘low’ setting that gives superior call quality even in windy conditions, something that NC700 lacks. Really disappointed with Bose’s quality control that has gone downhill over the years."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-07,Excellent headphones,I did alot of research before buying these headphones. I work in an open floorplan office and travel weekly on airplanes. These headphones block out all noise. The sound quality is great. Worth every penny
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-07,DO NOT BUY - Android,"These are very capable headphones. Not a great leap from the Q35 II's, but the design is nice. the problem is that the app WILL NOT CONNECT! read the reviews. It's terrible. They don't care at all if you can connect at all. If you have iOS, great, it will work perfectly for you. Us Android users they don't care at all about our experience. DO NOT BUY!!! Get the Sony's (the X4's are coming and that is my buy!). I am returning these."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-07,No way to switch between multiple devices,The problem with these headphones is that it’s not easy to switch between two ble devices. When I’m listening to music on my computer I cannot take a phone call that comes in. The needs to be a button to quickly switch between two devices. Otherwise there is no point in allowing it to connect to 2 devices at the same time.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-10,Noise Cancellation works very well in Airplanes and trains.,"The Noise Cancellation works very well in airplanes and trains. The sound quality is very good, but not as good as wired in-ear earbuds. I like using these headphone when talking on my cell phone in noisy locations as I can hear very well (with the noise cancellation helping) and the microphones do an excellent job of sensing my voice while filtering some of the ambient noise."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-10,Definitely a must buy for music buffs.,Awesome seed round and good noise cancelling headphones
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-10,Soundproof with great sound,Love this. Can be working in a room with active kids and be on an island. Only thing a bit quirky - ability to answer phone calls is inconsistent.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-11,Awesome Headphone,Excellent Headphone. It’s awesome beyond comparison with any other similar product.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-11,CANCELACION DE RUIDOS,Impresionante te aisla totalmente de los ruidos externos
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-14,Bass,The headphones are great with the noise cancelling and the sound but lacks in bass a little. still good headphones but could use some bass
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-14,Fantastic purchase,"Excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. I can listen to audiobooks with amazing clarity while flying. With the touch of a button, I can have a conversation without taking them off."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-16,Disappointing,"I had an earlier model of this headphones and they worked great. This version is terrible. I cannot for the life of me get them to turn off. Tried all the suggestions on their support page, nothing worked. The light turns off, but if you put the headphones on you can hear that they are still on. If you Google this problem, you will see that a ton of other people have the same issue. And BTW, the app doesn't even have this model on it, which makes no sense. I'm going to have to return them, which is a shame because I did like the older version which had a real on/off button."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-03-17,Unacceptable performance for a $400 headphones,"First let me start by saying I'm a very long Bose headphones user. Previously owned a QC15, QC20, QC25, and a QC30. This 700 headphones is the worse of them so far!! 1. You can't operate the headphones without installing an app on your phone
2. You can't operate the headphones unless you create a Bose account
3. The Bass is very low; you'd think after all this time that Bose can do something about it. But no; very disappointing bass
4. The headphone rarely can have a successful connection to Bose's own App!!... Major quality assurance fail
5. The headphone is advertised to have the ability to connect to two devices; something that previous Bose bluetooth headphones had; this was my deciding factor when I was thinking whether to get these headphones or the Sony's. However when you connect your PC and your Phone, the audio from the PC will stutter badly!! and this is consistent. Another major quality fail. 6. The physical design of the headphone's head band makes it difficult to adjust the height. Previous designs were better. Bose has been pushing one fail headphone after another starting with the QC30. This loyal customer is finally ready to look at the competition for better quality. Bose lost it way"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-19,Best headphones on the market.,Super amazing. Tells you battery life when you turn it on. Super comfortable as well.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-19,Great overall,"I've had to recently use these headphones at home and I had a meeting in the living room while the kids were playing and watching TV. I asked the person I was meeting with if they could hear anything and they said it was quiet! Even a dog barking next to me was ""heard a little bit"". My only gripe is the bluetooth connections. I have it synced to my phone and laptop so if it looses connection with the phone, there's a verbal message that can be distracting, especially if you're in a meeting because you'll miss what was said. Other co-workers have purchased these and they love them!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-20,WOW!,Bose does it again! I have owned their products for over 30 years and their High quality has never changed. These headphones are the best.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-20,Need it,Awesome
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-03-20,Save your money and buy another brand,"Great headphones for listening to music. These are garbage for calls. No one can hear you and the Bluetooth often times drops in the middle of a call. The Bose app for these is also trash where half the time it doesn’t recognize the set but the set will work with your phone. The sound quality for music is stellar, but that’s the only positive thing about these headphones. Also when traveling they take up a ton of room due to the thick and heavy case. You will not get a wink of sleep with them on as they are somewhat bulky and uncomfortable to lay on. For the price, these should be flawless; the Bluetooth should work 100% of the time and on calls my voice should be crystal clear. Will probably avoid buying anymore Bose products in the future because these were such a big disappointment."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-03-20,"Overpriced, intrusive, mass-market junk","My wife bought these as a gift for me. She knew none of my other cans were noise cancelling. The setup, well documented in other negative reviews, was infuriating and intrusive. I got them to work, however, and found the ANC to be very effective while at the gym but the BT connection to be unreliable. At home, I put some well recorded music through them and the sound quality was on par with a pair of cans I have costing half the price from manufacturers that are dedicated to making audiophile headphones. Then, they automatically shut off after 10 minutes while I was sitting still in my recliner. I have Master & Dynamic cans that cost the same as these and these come nowhere near the sound quality. Two stars because the ANC works well but the frustrating and intrusive but required app, sketchy BT, unremarkable sound quality, need to move just to keep them powered up, and high price, and the decision to return these was easy."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-20,A must have travel item,Best noise cancelling headphones I have ever had. Battery life is amazing. These have travelled with me on 6 International flights and are a must have.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-21,Great value,Great value....nice stereo surround effects
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-21,"Best in class, not in value","These are absolutely the best. Audio quality and noise cancelation is exactly par with the other qc35 and the Sony 1000s (I have had all three) but the microphones are much better. The big question is if that is worth the $100+ price difference. Depends how price sensitive you are. Style is also great, though it's hard to tell from pictures. Looks better than the qc35, on par with the Sony"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-21,Good fit great quality as expected,The usual Bose quality and quite comfortable. The over the ear fit does get a little sweaty no matter what I'm doing. But the material seems to hold up as long as I keep it clean. Ease of use is really great. Just slide up or down with your finger on the right ear to adjust volume.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-22,Great,Fabulous product. Really enjoying it.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-22,the touch controls on the ear are a enormous design failure,"The headphones themselves work well, as expected for a relatively high priced item. I was able to connect them to my devices easily, although the bose app itself is the worst part of the set up experience. My issue with the headphones is that you cannot disable the touch gestures on the right side of the headphones. This is constantly bumped doing much of anything, most notably taking the headphones on or off. Bose just tried to be way too cute with this feature as its totally unnecessary and can't be turned off. There's a funny comment on the bose forums from a bose tech that says if you could disable the touch functionality you wouldn't be able to control volume/whats playing! as if we never had a way to control your music volume/track selection any other way! But ya these headphones are hard to use if you aren't just setting at a desk uninterrupted. I use my headphones in bed sometimes when I'm trying not to make noise watching something and if you lay on your right side you will randomly skip tracks all the time because of the touch controls. It skips tracks when I try to take them off to talk to someone for a second. Its really a huge bummer than an otherwise good pair of headphones have this feature. I guess I just really want a simple/very high quality pair of wireless headphones, not another siri-enabled object to talk to with a bunch of random touch surfaces. Bose needs to understand the scope of things they are good at end at sound--the more they try to pretend to be a (low tier) tech company the worse their products will be going forward."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-03-23,Low voice quality and quite uncomfortable headphone,I am quite disappointment with this product. Main issue is this is a very uncomfortable to use. It keeps falling from the head. You have to keep your head straight all the time. The quality of sound is average and i am regretting buy it. I am so surprised to see other folks rating this high. I am big Bose fan but this product has been released in hurry. Noise cancelling and other stuff is good.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-23,"Does not connect to app, poor tech service","It is shameful to see top technology botched by poor useless app. 700 has maintained great noise canceling technology but the app makes it completely unusable. I echo many of the reviews here and after over half year since launch, app hasn’t been improved much at all despite multiple upgrades. I wanted very badly to keep this headphone but after wasting many hours and days of my precious time on internet and phone calls, this product does not deserve my further attention."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-23,Great unless you're actually around loud stuff.,Dissapointed and I had high hopes for these. I watched a video of a guy running a gas blower while speaking through the mic and you could hear him plain as day. I thought these would be perfect on my mower so I can guard my hearing listen to tunes take business calls and not have to power down completely. They crackle and pop with horrible static while on the mower. Im not sure what's causing it but they are unusable around my commercial mower. I'm going to attempt to replace them and see if its a defect.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-03-24,WARNING: Won't connect while charging; battery not replaceable,"So frustrating to spend $400 to only learn some limitations: these headphones DO NOT WORK while charging, which means there's no way to use them without functional battery. The battery can't be replaced either -- so for $400, plan to throw these away after a few years of heavy use...
The pairing / bluetooth connection is also annoying. These worked for me without the app, and I refuse to use any headset that requires an app because invariably the app will stop being supported, wether one year or ten years away... basically: these have a limited life but look great at first."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-25,"Good sound quality, noise cancelation pretty good",I bought these to help cancel out snoring friends during a dive trip. While I could still hear that deafening snore from my friend who didnt have his CPAP it did greatly cut it down. I just wish I could figure out the auto shut off that kept turning my book on tape off. The sound quality is very good and they are mostly comfortable if left on for hours.
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-25,Terrible behavior between multiple synced devices,"I have my headphones paired between two devices. When one is off, and the headphones are turned on, they'll search for that device indefinitely. There is no button on the headphones to select devices. This is an absurd oversight."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-03-25,"Terrible integration with my computer. Generates noise, bad microphone.","I want to sit in front of my computer, get noise cancellation, and a decent microphone
Instead of noise cancellation, it's producing it's own noise (hizzzzzzzz)
Instead of a good microphone, people can not understand what I say - so I had to switch mics
So what's left? Oh, and you need to download their app if you want to configure the phone. The app doesn't work if you don't create an account first. That's an unneeded invasion of privacy, Bose."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-25,Returned after 3 days,"This product offers stylish and beautiful design and very well thought out packaging. Sound quality and noise cancelling are excellent. However, despite all efforts, the volume remained persistently low, phone calls were dropped and connections via Bluetooth with a PC were elusive at best. At this price point, the product ought to just WORK perfectly. It didn't."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-26,Perfect.,This is as good as you can get right now.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-26,Unsuitable for daily use,"I care a lot about over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphones. I've owned many models from Bose over the last 20 years, as well as the Sony XM2 and XM3. I am disturbed by the Bose media blitz / social influencing campaign that is somehow netting largely positive reviews of the Bose 700s. They are *much* better than the Sony WH1000XM3s for phone call audio. Their noise cancelling abilities are similar enough. In every other way, they are SIGNIFICANTLY worse, to the point where I *only* use them for phone calls. As you would expect from Bose, the software support is terrible. But it's worse than that: Bose has designed these so as to rely on a ""primary"" bluetooth device (your phone, most likely). So the software implementation affects usability greatly. One of the worst aspects is that the headphones will start to randomly ""click"" with static sometimes if the primary device, thinking it can power down its bluetooth antenna (since you're listening on another device), becomes intermittently connected. This leads to me power cycling the headphones ridiculously often. One of my major uses for noise-cancelling headphones is in ELIMINATING distractions, but these headphones provide their own distractions frequently. I hate them. The other place where Bose is terrible is battery life and quick charging. Again, this presents another major source of distraction. Whereas my MX3 charge seems to last forever, I find myself often turning on the 700s to the annoying voice notice of a low battery warning."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-27,Not worth the $400! Lots of issues with these,"I was really hoping to like these headphones. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. They are very good looking headphones but that is probably the only highlight. First you have to download the app to use. That itself is a disaster. There isn’t much you can do with it but also it is constantly disconnecting. There’s is no EQ. Understandably you don’t buy these headphones for music quality but not being able to at least adjust it a little is a huge negative. When you use them out of the box the noise cancelling is pretty good. And then you update it....after I updated them the NC got worse!! After I thought I was making it up but after reading several forums this was the case for a lot of people. The touch functionality works great but I didn’t buy them for that. There are a lot of negative reviews on these but i still took a chance, but those reviews were right. Fortunately for me I was still able to return them. These are definitely not worth $400. If they were half the price maybe and that’s a big maybe. The headphones just feel like they were put together just to try and come up with something to compete with other newer ANC and they failed miserably. I wouldn’t recommend these."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-03-27,Poor multi-device experience,"Very disappointed with these headphones. I bought them for using them on my phone and laptop especially to receive calls on my phone and have Skype (and other) calls on my laptop. First, when i'm listening to something on my laptop, once i unlock my phone the sound start to glitch even though no sound is coming from the phone. And then i tried to have a Skype call on my laptop, i couldn't hear the other party clearly and they couldn't hear me clearly either, totally useless. When i'm listening from one device they work very well and the sound quality is really nice, very comfortable as well. But for this price, I expect them to be at least usable and deliver what they promise. I'll try them for another week, if my experience doesn't get better i'm returning them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-27,Music will sound different,Best sound ever
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-27,These are horrible!,They hurt my head and cause extreme headaches. The sound quality is poor. They are very heavy. UPS and Amazon are not helping me return them at all. I can't even print a return label and UPS keeps rejecting them at my front door because the return label is incorrect. I guess I am out $450.00. Very disappointed with both Bose and Amazon!
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-28,Terrible app and connectivity issues,"Sadly, an otherwise first rate set of headphones is ruined by a third rate app and chronic connectivity issues. I use three devices, phone, mac and ipad with the headphones and the app only supports 2 connections at a time. Connecting the third device is a time wasting nightmare. Once the headphones work, they are wonderful which makes this terrible app all the more galling. If you only use one or two devices to connect, I guess it would be fine, but I am very disappointed."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-29,Great but not the best,I thought they were excellent until I bought the Sony WH-1000XM3. The Bose are great but the Sony’s are just a notch above.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-03-30,Box came without cables!?,"For $400, you might expect cables :-) I think this was just a goof."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-03-30,My Partner Owns these and I just ordered a pair for myslef,"I have tried a bunch of phones over the past few years, from budget to expensive (Sennhieser, JBLs, Sony, Skull Candy Crushers, Old Bose models, etc, etc) and these blow them all out of the water, BY FAR. The people posting negative reviews have got to be trolls. The one legitimate gripe is the app is a little funky and it may get weird hooking up more than 3 devices, but my partner is past the initial set up and is hooked up to two different laptops and an iPhone and it's fine. People are insane saying these are bad phones, they are absolutely some of the best on the market, and the comfort is by far the best ever. Anyone complaining about the comfort has no idea what they're talking about. If you have problems with the app, or maybe if you're a true high-end audio-file I suppose you could knock the sound quality (but even then the sound is pretty darn fantastic) thats the only few things I could maybe give you. but anyone knocking the comfort is in for a long journey find something more comfortable than these."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-30,This was very disappointing,Got this and it was DOA. it wont even power on.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-01,How can anyone rate these 5 star??,"Maybe it is the cost or the fact that everything is relative, but I have not idea how anyone can be satisfied with these headphones!!! Pros-
1)it does do a nice job reducing outside white noise
2)battery is great never run low
3)comfortable for long duration in a chair
cons-
1)THEY DO NOT CONNECT TO 2 DEVICES EFFECTIVELY!!! constant drops/will not play/auto connect even when you try and stop it. If you want to use these with one and only one device (like EVER do not pair multiple EVER) it would increase my rating by 1 maybe 2 stars. DO NOT TRY AND PAIR TO MULTIPLE DEVICES PERIOD END OF STORY
2) They do not stay on your head if you are moving around or bend over
3) randomly alexa will come on. even when the room is dead silent and you are reading listening to music. super annoying and you have to push a button to make her go away
4) alexa does not work great with these headphones and an iphone
the Bose software team is really letting down the hardware team and making these headphones extremely infuriating!! I have been patiently waiting a firmware update hoping these would be better, but alas the last one was nov 2019!"
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-04-01,Mic doesn't work with Windows laptop,"This device is great with music, has all required great sound qualities as advertised. It has a very good noise cancellation when used with a phone. The FLAW .. this microphone of this headphone doesn't work with Windows laptops. Unfortunately, Bose is not able to fix this issue even after many users are complaining since this headphone came out. There no solution offered by Bose for this or forecasted any ETA for the solution."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-04-02,Love / Hate Relationship With Them... Here's Why.,"I'm wearing them now. It's wonderful to put them on and all the noise, all the distractions, all the chaos to go away. They're also amazing for movies, courses and calls. But they kinda suck for music. The QC 35 from which I upgraded from had a beautiful sound signature. These are still good, way better than your average $100 pair of headphones but it's a step down. So you get better ANC (I wouldn't call it far better but that's about the best one can get with current technology) but you don't get brilliant sound - just good. So I don't really use them for music. What else can I say about them? They're part made of metal and I chipped them while on a plane. That was my fault as I slept with them on against the window. And I dropped them on the ground. Fine, it's my fault entirely as I don't take care of them and I can live with chipped headphones, I don't care. The battery life is very good and it feels like it lasts forever. The touch-pad is gimmicky but it works fine. I almost never use it though, I just use the source controls from the device. The fit is fine. People are complaining they're not comfortable. I could wear them for 12 hours without any issues whatsoever and I do come from QC 35. The case is a bit bigger, I think, but feels very solid. They've moved to USB C instead of USB 3.0 as the last model. For me it means now I have to carry even another type of cable with me. I just wish everyone would adopt a standard so I don't need three different cables for my devices. ANC is very good and as always, works best with patterns of sound. So you'll get perfect results in a plane or train and good results with people talking. It's incredible when you put them on in an environment where it is so loud you can't hear your thoughts and it reduces them so much you can sleep. All that hum and background noise even feels meditative in nature, helping you sleep earlier. With music, it struggles a bit with voice but it still cuts down 15 - 20 DB. I'm in a coffee shop where the music is very loud, I can barely hear it. Connection is hit and miss. It will stay connected but sometimes it's hard to connect another device. It will either not show up in Bose Music (oh yeah, guess what? You need another app to connect it, because Bose Connect is not good enough for it - so officially Bose has three different apps just for connecting their devices - Bose Connect, Bose SleepBuds and Bose Music) or it will not disable connections properly. This is a problem only if you have more than two devices you want to use, as it can switch from one to another very easily. But if you have let's say an iPad, laptop and phone, and you want to disconnect the phone and connect the iPad, it is cumbersome. Go to the app, wait until it disconnects the phone, connect the iPad. So yeah - I like them. But of course it has many things going for it - it's $400. When most people pay $40 for a pair of headphones, at $400 you'd better get a lot of good things. Personally for me they're a life saver as I work from home and coffee shops and I love that sweet silence. They've brought me a lot more in added productivity than I've paid for them. For others - it's up to you to decide."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-02,"Poor bluetooth connectivity, very difficult to set up, should only be used with a phone","After an hour of updating device software and trying different fixes, it was eventually possible to get the mandatory app working and the device activated. Works fine when connected to a phone. However, it will usually not play audio from my desktop, as it is not being detected as a valid audio output. Occasionally it gets past that, but the poor connection means the audio frequently skips, making the bluetooth unusable. Eventually got it working with the audio cable after another couple hours, apparently there is a different volume setting for the cable vs. bluetooth, and the cable audio defaults to zero, so it will appear to not be working until you change the volume control specifically for that."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-03,These headphones bring peace of mind,"I need headphones to survive and after my last pair got stolen, I figured that it was just a sign to upgrade to these. I had been eyeing them for a while and they are just as good as I thought! They really do block most noise (around 90% I would say and I love in noisy NYC). The sound quality is excellent and I actually work out in them without issue (just had to tighten the headband). Great buy."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2020-04-03,Get's tangled in hair; design flaw,"They are great cans, but so are others. They are not the most comfortable (including prior Bose models) for extended use, and will badly snag your hair unless you consciously pull your hair back before taking them off."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-05,Headphone,All I need to say is WOW!!!! !
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-05,Headphones and app don't work together,Just received these today and the sound is meh. My Bose QC II had better noise cancelling and bass response. These headphones might sound decent if the app would ever work right. Been fighting for 3 hours to get these headphones to register so I can use the features in the app to no avail. The bose website has no help for this problem. For almost $400 I should get a tad better product and app service that actually work. Stick with Sony.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-06,DO NOT BUY IF LOOKING TO WORK FROM HOME ON COMPUTER,"Ok i got these amidst the Covid-19 to work from home as we utilize Microsoft Teams primarily and other VoIP software like GoTo Meeting. The sound just DROPS OUT on Teams and you canʻt hear any of the audio for video or audio only calls through Teams AND GoTo Meeting, forcing the user to restart the headphones and reestablish the connection to the computer. This apparently has been an issue for the better part of 8 months for many users, as evidenced by the many many bose threads about these issues and VoIP software. The solution? Spend more money to buy a 3rd party Bluetooth dongle receiver to minimize these issues. I REALLY REALLY wanted to like these. They are so soft/comfortable and do work with phone pretty great, call quality is very good from phone. & Yes Iʻm aware Bose is now basically releasing these with a Bluetooth receiver and calling it Bose 700 UC (as of this writing there has not been a set release date for the UCs) Honestly Iʻm still just so disappointed and frustrated because so many articles highly recommended these for WFH life and at this price point it just feels so unacceptable that the solution for already bluetooth-capable headphones is to require a USB receiver to pair properly with a laptop/computer. I will consent that they work great with my phone but giving them 2-3 stars because I really bought these with the expectation that they should work with a computer better."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-07,Great sound,Met the boss starndards
Bose,NC700,3,0,2020-04-07,"When it comes to conference calls while working from home, these headphones are terrible","These headphones are terrible for conference calls. They do not cancel out background noise -- a delivery truck beeping several houses away is perfectly audible through them. They also have issues with picking up random static sounds, delivering choppy audio or speaking, and a myriad of minor annoyances that I should not have to deal with on $400 headphones. Otherwise, they look good are a okay for personal use. But when it comes to work or anything professional, I think their downsides are enough that I would definitely not buy them again."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-07,Disappointing for price,The headphones are really comfy. But that is about all the good i can say about it. The app and Bluetooth features are infuriating trying to get them to function. Not to mention an app for the desktop doesn't even exist. There is a static hissing sound whenever you wear them which is annoying over time. Touch features are confusing and the overall sound quality isn't anything special.
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-04-07,You charge and listen to them at the same time!! :(,These clamp my head too much and you cant even listen to them while charging. Poor results discovered after hours of happiness i had to charge them plugged em in and they completely disconnect. There may be some other way like using a cord but i paid for these to be wireless and thats what i expected. Total Failure i would look into other headphones if u want constant consistant listening times. They do sound great amd look fancy but do we need all the extra bs no we dont. They need to take a step back and fix all the issues and sell a decent pair of headphones that you can listen to wirelessly while charging like foreal what year is it people
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-08,excellent noise cancelling,My husband bought these and is very happy. He does not hear me when I talk to him...
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-08,Poor Performance for Price Point,"Had several problems with this headset right out of the box. To use all the features, you are required to use the Bose Music app and make a Bose account. Regrettably, connecting the headphones to the app is a nightmare and it took several attempts of power cycling the headset and making phone forget the headphones before the app recognized them. This problem was consistent through use; the app would only recognize the headset rarely. Several other issues were observed, adding to the poor experience. -Voice performance was poor. My voice would crackle on calls, and the sound cancellation feature did not seem to work as advertised. Those on my calls could hear a lot of background noise intermingled with my voice. -Headphones lacked strong bass and there is no equalizer function to adjust for personal preference. -Sound cancelling and conversation/transparency mode does not work nearly as well as demonstrated in the demo video. Even with the cancelling set to max, I could easily hear most ambient sound around me. -Trying to use these headphones when connected to two devices is not seamless or intuitive. Encountered many connectivity issues and problems with sound cutting in and out. -Headphones would not fully charge when connected to laptop for charging and instead had to be plugged into a wall outlet if maximum charge was desired. -Firmware updates through the Bose Music app were excruciatingly slow, and directions on how to update from a PC are not provided. For $400, I would have expected a seamless pairing experience with the app and my devices, as well as top tier sound and voice performance; these headphones provided neither. Returned after 2 days of use."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-09,You owe it to yourself to own the best sound quality headphones on the market today. ! —Michael H.,"Unbelievable sound quality! My music comes alive. Movies aren’t just movies anymore, they’re events! Love, love love ‘em! —Michael H."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-09,Great for Quarantine lol,Extremely impress with the quality of this BOSE product in every way.
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-09,Too many issues that I wouldn't expect from a $400 headphone,"- There is an annoying delay when you speak in phone calls
- Often times the headphone disconnects from the cell phone and you dont realize until you stop hearing people talk for a while
- If you try to change the noise cancelling level while on a call or listening to music, the sound is interrupted by the voice saying what the new level is and you miss part of the conversation or music. Seems like it would be an easy fix from Bose to have it not interrupt the sound. - Hurts the top of my head after wearing for a while - maybe it is too heavy
- The ear drums start to ache after a while. It has something to do with the noise cancelling. Google online - there are multiple talks about this. - The battery level announcement when you switch on is many times not updated after charging - you hear the level before the change instead"
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-04-10,If you like burning money BOSE is for you,"Poor audio quality and the sponge piece started wearing off after a short gentle use. I don't mind spending money on things that last and have great quality. BOSE does not fit into either one. I tried talking to them off line. They have terrible customer service. I will not be speaking to them off line ever, and definitely no longer will I purchase crap from BOSE. Eat my BOSE. The best headphones of 2020

Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-10,"Great sound, bad product","I was excited to get these as I beat my QC 35 IIs to death, and wanted to upgrade when they finally glitched out. The noise-cancelling and sound quality in these are great - don't get me wrong. Comfortable to wear, too. But I've struggled to use the product itself. I was stunned to discover how hard it is to switch between devices - on the QC 35 IIs, it's a button on the headset that allows you to rotate between devices. Here, you have to do it on the app - which means you can never unpair from your phone, or you're hosed until re-pairing. Why can't this just be a button? I nominate the ""assistant"" button, which I never use and will never use. Bose is trying to funnel you through the app to control the headphones, but I don't want that. I just want the headphones to work without thinking about the app. Given how much you have to do in the app, though, it'd be nice if the thing actually detected the headphones over 50% of the time when they're connected to the phone. I usually have to force-quit the app and restart it to get them to see the headphones. Finally, I really hate the touch-sensitive controls. I hate having to concentrate just to change the volume - if you swipe your finger just a tad the wrong way, it'll do something you didn't expect like pause or go back. Maddening that it's not just ""automatic"" in the way the QC 35 IIs were. The thing that finally got me to write this review was today when after charging all night, they were only reporting 4 hours battery life. Going online found a quick solution - holding down some button while plugging in the power cable to reset the headphones - but c'mon. I want to spend 0% of my time fretting over my headphones, but every day it's something new. While these are a step up in noise-cancelling and sound quality, they are a big step back from actually using the product. The QC 35 IIs were a delight to use - these are a pain in the butt. Hopefully firmware updates can fix some of the flaws, but I'm disappointed in Bose with these given the obvious luxury pricing."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-04-10,REALLY NICE TO USE,WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN THE NOISE CANCELLING FROM MY OLDER 35'S. DOES A GREAT JOB CANCELLING NOISE EVEN WHEN NO MUSIC IS PLAYING. WITH MUSIC - YOU REALLY DO NOT HEAR THE OUTSIDE WORLD. JUST EXPENSIVE
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-10,"Great design and hardware, poor software","The noise cancellation is awesome, and the sound quality is superb. But I'm returning this product because I just can't use it with my two Mac laptops and a phone without constant restarts and re-pairings. The phone software that is the only way to change most of the headphones' settings is very buggy and loses connection to the headphones every time I try to use it. When I'm switching between mic and listening, these headphones lose connection to my Macbook, too. The voice prompts are annoying, but if I turn them off, the beeps that replace them are even more annoying. Maybe things will improve with updates, but for now, it's a no-go for me."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-10,Quality of materials and sound quality,This product is amazing!ear cuft is very soft not like the one i have beats delivery is so fast as well!
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-10,Great headphones except for one BIG thing...,"Bought these for my business calls since my two college-aged sons are home, and I need to be able to make calls with lots of noise around. The noise cancelling is great. Mic quality is great, even with lots of background noise just feet from me. My biggest issue is that there is no way to reassign or disable the voice assistant button. This is easy to hit by mistake, and can cause the phone to make unwanted calls to your contacts. No way to turn it off! Dozens of requests for a fix on the Bose community website over the past 9 months, and the consistent Bose response is ""Sorry, we don't have a fix."" Inexcusable for what is supposed to be a top tier product, and poor customer service. I don't use a voice assistant, so a work around for me is to choose Alexa for my voice assistant on Bose music app. At least then I just get an interruption to my call or audio telling me to set up Alexa, rather than inadvertently calling a client. My other gripe is the Bose Music app, which consistently can't locate my headphones even though they are connected to my phone's Bluetooth. I have to remove them from the app and ""install"" them again. Not much in the way of features with the app, and I don't want to use Bose Music, but I have to have this app to access the very few features that can be customized for the headphones. Bad showing, Bose, especially for this price. Still deciding if it's worth keeping these or getting something else."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-11,The obvious upgrade from QC35II,"Despite the fact that these headphones are not intended as a replacement to the existing QC35II lineup, they're a welcome upgrade. I've had my QC35II's for the past three years and loved them. I actually purchased these three days ago when I thought the Bluetooth interface was acting up in them, but once these arrived, I discovered my MacBook was the problem. I'll chalk it up to a win nonetheless. Both pairs of headphones boast high-quality materials, but it's clear when looking at my old headphones that certain components weren't necessarily built to stand the test of time. Take the headband cushion, for instance: it's lined with Alcantera leather, which is great, but it's starting to fade a bit. With the Bose 700s, they used a soft, taut rubber. I feel better about how that'll last over time. There's also the fact that the QC35's have small ""clicks"" that occur when you move the earcups up and down to adjust for your head size once you remove them from the storage case. Those notches seem to have loosened slightly over the last several years of ownership, but the 700's have done away with the clicking action and simply slide. I'm only a full day in on using the headphones periodically, but I adore them already. I may update this review with some later findings, but I'm so thankful I got these."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-12,Holy Freak!!,"Holy freak! These are amazing headphones. I’ve had the QC 35 from Bose and they eventually died. So then I got Beats and then they died. So I went with the Bose 700 this time and I feel like I went from a flip phone to an iPhone. I’m shocked that people like Beats, honestly but I realize people have different tastes. For me, the Bose 700 are just what I like. The noise canceling is mind blowing. I show it to people and their eyes get big. The sound quality is excellent. And the fit and finish are top notch. They’re just a first-class product all the way."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-13,"bad noise cancellation, can’t use while charging","noise cancellation hardly works, can’t use while charging, sony headphones are much better quality"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-13,small annoying issues with connectivity,"The noise cancellation is awesome, and the sound quality is superb. But I'm thinking of returning this product because I just can't use it with laptop and phone without constant voice prompts which are very annoying. if i am using it with laptop and receive a call on phone then i loose connectivity with laptop in the middle of a meeting. So if i am in the call on laptop i need to disconnect it from phone. Moreover that does not solve the issue because if you receive email or messages on teams then you loose connectivity for few seconds as well. Very disappointing for otherwise amazing headphone . But not good for business use where you need connectivity to multiple devices"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-13,Happy I made the purchase!,"I have the original Q35 Noise cancelling headphones that work perfectly still but I wanted to treat myself to wireless headphones. I'm so happy I did! These are definitely worth the money. They are just as comfortable as the Q35, and sleeker design. Plus the obvious upgrade for me was wireless connectivity. I'm not a huge sound junkie, but what made me purchase these headphones over the ""leading brand Sony"" is that they were built for a business person in mind / commuter. The travel case is less bulky, noise cancellation is just as good. The key difference is the audio for calls and ""ease"". Never thought I would use the personal assistant function, but you can ask to start your Spotify, call people and what the weather is going to be. It's definitely a useful function if you don't want to get your phone out of your pocket and etc.
In terms of set up, a) it is annoying you have to download an app to get your product started but its not a huge deal, but b) connecting was very easy and I like how I can connect to multiple devices. The app is more to use if you want to customize your noise cancellation level, change your device name and etc.
Last thing that Bose should've just included the airplane adapter in the package. It's a bit odd that it was not included like the Q35 versions. I use the adapter a lot when travelling internationally. It's only $9 online to get, but it's kind of annoying that you have to buy something that was included in prior models. Not sure what their thinking was. In general a few cons, but overall extremely satisfied with my product! Pros definitely outweigh the cons and happy I decided to upgrade and you should too if you're considering it. Game changer."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-14,"Incredible noise cancellation, but 5 minutes of wear gives me splitting headaches","The noise cancellation on these is ridiculous and they sound pretty good, but 5 minutes of wear gives me splitting headaches and makes my ears ring from these squeezing my head so much. How does this happen when Bose is the company that made the one pair of headphones I've ever owned that I'd describe as ""almost too loose"" with the headband fully stretched out (QC 25)? Also the earcups on these were almost too small."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-04-14,beware for videoconferencing,"I bought the 700s and loved them for a couple of days. I chose them because of the Bose name and the ability to connect with two devices at once, since I work from home. They were very comfortable and very stylish. Great sound, fantastic mic and NC. Unfortunately, they would not stay connected to my Windows 10 work PC, particularly during Zoom. I tried everything possible. The connection would be fine for a little while and then drop out. Tried disconnecting my phone, rebooting, everything possible. Tried connecting to another PC--dropped there as well. I wanted to keep them so badly, I spent all day trying to figure it out. I was hoping it was a fluke. Unfortunately, a quick Google search revealed, as is usual in these cases, that it wasn't just me. The 700s are notorious for dropping the Bluetooth connections, particularly with laptops. So I returned them and purchased the Sony WH 100XM3 headphones. They work just fine, no dropped connections. The Sony's don't have the multipoint. But what good is multipoint on the Bose if the gear doesn't stay connected?"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-15,Worth the money,"I'd been considering buying these for quite some time. I'm more of a beats gal, but after my last beats studio broke I decided to try something new. Bose are a bit more expensive but, I'd heard great things. After reading what seemed like an endless amount of reviews, I made the plunge. I love them! Super comfortable, great sound, great nose cancelling. Highly recommend."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-04-15,Bose700 Headphones,Prefer the original design but overall quality is good. Headphones were missing character and audio cables. Notified seller. No response.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-15,A bit uncompfrtable to wear compared to QC 35,Long battery life. Sometimes the microphone doesn't work properly on Zoom. One of my colleagues said I sound like Fauci on TV.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-04-16,Great headphones,I love the feel on your head they don't hurt your ears after long time use and you can use them for gaming
Bose,NC700,2,0,2020-04-17,"Decent Bose sound, Great Cancelling, Poor Connecting and Usability",The inadequate software makes these headphones useless half the time when they don't connect
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-04-17,Very uncomfortable if you need to wear for a long time.,"I have owned many Bose noise cancelling headphones ranging from the QC 15, QC25, QC35 I, QC35 II and have always loved each new version better than the previous one...until now. This time it seems Bose did not leave enough room inside the ear cups for your ears. After wearing for a long time, these become very uncomfortable. On a whim, I tried out the Sony WH1000XMS and there is no question that the Sony is a better buy. I am loyal to Bose and will always give them the first shot when they come out with a new pair of headphones, but I found the app, the features, the noise cancelling and the comfort to all be better on the Sony. I have zero loyalty to Sony as I have been disappointed by many of their products over the years, but I can confidently say they got it right this time around. Sadly, the opposite is the case with the Bose 700 which are just not comfortable to wear for long periods of time."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-18,Product activation failed,"Well-documented issues connecting to the Bose Music app and activating product, even a year+ post launch. Was not ready for prime time. Stay away, go with Sony."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-18,Good product,Great
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-04-19,Near perfect.,"Beautiful noise cancelling headphone with few flaws. PROS
+Build quality and design is great. Very compact and sturdy build
+Touch controls are the most responsive I have seen on any headphone. +Active noise cancelling is phenomenal and was able to almost completely block out construction next door
+App offers good customization option. The app allows for fine tuning of ANC, being able to choose through levels 1-10 (1-4: ambient sound, 5: neutral, 6-10: noise cancelling). Additionally, any of three of the levels can be set to the ANC button and toggled through. +Flat, but detailed and clear sound
+Soft earpads and very nice headband support
CONS
+Because of the curvature of the headband, the earcups come in at a bit of an extreme angle, forcing a significant amount of pressure on the jaw. For those who are more sensitive, this could prove to be problem after an hour or so of listening. +App doesn't include EQ"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-20,love and hate,"This phone sounds amazing with very clear high and deep sub bass. The noise cancelling and microphone on this thing is top notch. It also has unsurpassed comfort and ergonomics. So doesn't it deserve 5 stars? What is bluetooth headphone which keeps on dropping connection? Getting paranoid hearing that loud buzz with disconnect and connect routine from time to time. I really want to love this headphone but every time I get disconnected with no reason, I hate it. Why does Bose resort to inferior AAC codec on this phone? There are plenty of good bluetooth codecs to choose from LDAC, APX, APX HD etc. Only SBC and AAC on this thing. Fix your bluetooth connection issue and people will love this headphone."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-21,Bose. Fix your app ASAP!,Ok so I had just received this new pair of headphones after my old anc headphones broke. I was really pumped for these and finally getting them and for the first day they worked great! Sound quality was pretty good and the noise cancelling was the best I’ve ever heard. The real deal breaker is the buggy and unreliable app. Holy crap does Bose need to get some engineers working overtime on this. After two hours of nonstop troubleshooting they still will not connect to the Bose music app. They connect to my iPhone just fine but the app refuses to connect. I’m very close to returning these headphones back. Please don’t waste your money and go buy a pair of Sony’s or something. Unless Bose figures out how to fix their app. Until then I guess they’ll just sit back and enjoy all of their customers leaving and scaring off new ones.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-22,Bluetooth connectivity issues,"I gave these only 2 stars on sound quality because while connected and playing audio there have been drops outs and crackling at times. They pair with my 2019 MacBook Pro, but there are occasional audio issues even when the laptop is 10 inches away. I was hoping for a firmware upgrade to the BOSE to fix the issues, but it says I'm on the latest version. Some kind of diagnostics in their app would be helpful...maybe signal strength meter or something that reports errors or interference."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-22,"Amazing, I don't know how I had a home office without these . . .","I bought a pair for my home office as I have a lot of background noise. Simply put, these headphones are amazing! The noise cancelling is extremely powerful, music is crystal clear and phones calls are so much better. They are also surprisingly comfortable to wear for long periods. Totally worth the money!"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-22,Great sound and noise cancelling-inconsistent BT connection and terrible app,"I primarily use headphones to listen to TV after my wife goes to bed. I use the noise canceling to filter out the hum of the air purifier in the room. I replaced my Cowin E7 ANC headphones. The Cowin replaced ZV-750 earbuds. I pair these with a 2 year old Samsung UN43MU63OF UHD Smart TV. First, the sound quality and noise canceling features are what I expect. I especially like the fact that the bass is more subdued than many headphones. I'm 74 and I am totally over the need for pounding bass :-). I also have minor hearing loss so understanding dialogue can be a problem, but NOT with these headphones. Furthermore the noise canceling cancels the hum of the air purifier. I also like the Conversation Mode feature that can turn the noise canceling and audio off with the touch of a button, carry on a conversation and then switch it back on -- no need to take the headphones off. I am TOTALLY satisfied with the listening experience. I also like that it annonces the battery level when you turn the phones and announces the names of the devices it is connected with. It can connect to two devices as well, so you can answer your phone while watching TV. I have not tried that feature, however. I do not use Alexa or Google Assistant, so I cannot comment on those features. What I am frustrated with is the inconsistency I have with connecting to the TV. Now to be honest, I have had problems with the BT connection on this TV with the other devices. However, the Cowin E7 had much fewer problems than my ZV-750. The Bose has had the most problems. Furthermore it is also has to be re-paired frequently. Not what you expect from a Bose product. Sometimes I have to get and walk 6 feet and stand next to the TV for it to connect. The other frustration is that the Bose Music app for IOS that you use to connect and configure the headphones is piece of crap. I found it confusing the first time I used it to connect to the headphones, but then found that it does not reconnect to the headphones automatically. Fortunately, you don't need the app after you have the few options setup on the phone, such as the 3 different noise canceling levels that can be controlled by the button on the headset, which voice assistant you want to use and the auto power off. I'm keeping the headset because I don't need the app to what I need and BT issues are not critical."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-24,Fails to meet advertised quality or support,"The 700 states in the product sheet that it has the ability to connect to multiple devices and switch between them. The product fails to maintain a connection with a PC and an iPhone. As soon as you open a Zoom or Skype or any other voice call on the PC, the iPhone will be disconnected. You will then hear a message in the earphones stating the disconnect occurred, which interferes with your voice call on the PC. Extensive online reviews indicate this failure, and there are massive reports of this failure in the Bose support forums. Product support has no fix, and will not acknowledge that it does not work. The price should be $100 less, and they should remove the false advertisement of this functionality from the product. In addition, when connected to both devices, the microphone quality is highly deterioriated, with delayed voice echo occurring on the PC Zoom or Skype calls, despite the iPhone having been disconnected by the Bose app. The earphones are comfortable, and if only connected to a single device work well, but the product is not worth $350 or even $250, without the multi-point bluetooth support, much less expensive options available from just about any of the other manufacturers."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-04-24,Sheer excellence,"Listen to any Beach Boys, Beatles or Pink Floyd song. The sound is just outstanding. I've had the 35's for years and I thought that Bose peaked. The noise-canceling is just on a different level. There's 3 levels of noise cancellation (0-lowest setting, 5-Bose 35 , 10-Dave Clark-Because). Cheers!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-04-24,Great headphones for music and phone calls!,"I bought this from Bose website and is very happy with it. Once paired (which is easy and quick) I like how immersive the music sounds and the call quality is great. I've had several other bluetooth headsets including Echo buds, and there are times when people can't hear me on the phone during a call. But with Bose, I have no issues. Another reason why I bought this headphone was because I do not like sticking something in my ear like the Echo buds, just a preference. I like the look and feel of this headphone, that you can use touch to adjust volume (something Echo buds can't do), and the touch controls are MUCH MORE reliable than Echo buds. There's a shortcut button in which you can store Noise Cancellation favorites (in terms of noise cancellation strength), which is being done by setting the favorite setting through the Bose phone app. You also have Google Assistant and Alexa available."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-24,These Headphones and their Software are not Ready for Primetime,"My QC35s were stolen by some jerk, so since I'm a big fan of being on the bleeding edge, I went ahead and got the latest and greatest by Bose. The fit and finish of these headphones were great, but man the Bose Music software, the replacement for Bose Connect, is buggy as hell. First of all, you can't use Bose Connect with these (I tried). Bose Music seems to be pretty close to the same design as Bose Connect. Maybe it's a little less fun to start out with. Bose connect let me choose a random fun name for my old QC35s (Astronaut Elvis!) but Bose Music was a little more suit and tie, Bose NR 700 it is. Ah well. If that was the only problem I had, then I wouldn't have returned them. The big issue I have is that like the Bose Connect software, the best way to connect the headset to my iPhone and then to other devices was to use Bose Music to manage the connection. But unlike Bose Connect that offered a consistent and functional experience, Bose Music constantly didn't work. I would have to start the Bose Music app, see that the headphones were shown as unavailable, restart the Bose Music app and then make the connection. What is worse is that sometimes the connection was already established! So for example if my phone was connected automatically, but I needed to take a call from an online meeting tool, I would need to connect my computer. But when I go to the application to do this, I would have to open it, see it fail to connect, close the app entirely, open it, wait for it to connect, and then do the connection switch. Super annoying and unproductive. Still, if it was just that, maybe I would have kept this headset. Another really big issue for me is that the headphones would only charge if they were plugged into a very powerful usb charger. The QC35s would charge from any old USB charger I had available. I have a headphone stand that has a usb charger built-in, for example. Super handy! Yeah, well the first night I had them, I plugged them in overnight and then woke up to find them not charged. Dang it! So after some messing around trying various chargers, I tried some high powered USB charger and I finally got it to charge. But occasionally even that didn't quite work, no idea why, so I resorted to my 87Watt MacBook Pro charger. That was the last straw. There are other issues that I consider design flaws that were more annoyances. I very often pressed the power button when I was putting the headphones on or adjusting them on my head, for example. Oh, also since the power switch isn't a physical slider, the power would turn off when you put it on the charger, but then it wouldn't turn on automatically when you pulled it off the charger. The QC35 has a physical slider, so whenever you pull it off the charger, it powers on automatically. So anyhow, I returned these and purchased new QC35 II headphones. I get to go back to the Bose Connect app, my usb charger that is built-in to my headphone stand, a more thoughtfully placed power switch, and automatic power on when I remove the headphones from the charger. And so life is good again. Seriously, I'd avoid these headphones. They're not worth the hassle even if you like to have the latest and greatest, like me."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-25,headphones distort at high audio.,the headphones have some pretty decent noise canceling but for the most part these are a scam for $350 usd i just got mine about 2 days ago and can’t even listen to music at its max/high audio without the speakers distorting. when listening to max audio there is 0 bass and just simply sounds like a $10 pair of skull candys from walmart. if you like listening to medium to low volumes this is a great option but for me they suck.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-25,Meh... Mixed Feelings,"About a month into using these headphones, overall, I think my biggest complaint is the price. For what you get, I wouldn't say it's worth it. If these were half the price, I wouldn't be so disappointed. On the highest level of sound cancellation, I can still hear A LOT. My main reason for purchasing these was to tune out some of the background noises in my small apartment. I'm stuck in 450 sq ft during quarantine orders, and I'm still a full-time student so I need to be able to concentrate. My boyfriend plays video games in the living room while I study and, I love him, but he can be really loud. I was hoping these would help me tune out him talking to his friends while I study, but I'd say it barely cuts the volume of his voice in half. Even on the highest NC setting, even with music turned up, I still hear him enough that it distracts me. So if you're thinking about buying these to tune out talking, I'd say it's not worth it. I can also hear all sorts of background noises like water running, AC blowing, etc that I really thought would be completely tuned out with the NC. Also, there's a weird glitch with them, and it'll often tell me I have a lot less battery life left than I do. Not the biggest deal, but it's annoying. The sound quality of the music is good, but I personally like the sound of my Beats headphones more, and they were a lot less expensive. I expected more from Bose. I think my favorite thing about these is the sleek design, but that on its own isn't worth the price. If I could, I'd give these 2.5 stars."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-04-25,Do not buy these for sleep,Do not buy these if you plan on using them for sleep!! They automatically shut off and this feature cannot be changed. Go to the bose message boards and search for auto shut off and read everyone else's reviews. I thought I was doing something wrong but I'm not. Bose made them this way. It's unfortunate because they really block the noise out but they're totally useless if they turn off.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-27,Finally noise cancellation that works,"I use multiple devices with this headset laptop windows 10/desktop windows 10/cell phone Android pixel 3 xl. I mainly wanted to buy this for the noise cancellation so I could read while my wife watches TV in bed. It's perfect for this. Pros
Nice fit and comfortable
Noise cancellation is soo good it's disorienting at first. (Key feature I was after)
Long battery life
Nice case
Multiple device support
Cons
Initial software setup/connecting to windows 10 was not easy. There trick is, you must select the right Bluetooth name from it since there are multiple names broadcasting from it and the first one you see probably isn't the correct one. Not the le_headset name. High cost, but premium product.."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-04-27,Weird shape,weird shape
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-28,"Comfortable, Good battery life and they function as advertised","Use for conference calls and some video conferencing. I doubt they are as good as the $1000 models but I don't need total noise elimination. Sometimes drop a call when dual connections conflict, but that is also true of my Pro version iBuds. No complaints."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-04-28,Very nice. Well made. But not perfect.,"One of the main reasons I bought these over other models was the excellent Noise Cancellation and Bluetooth 5.0. Otherwise I would have purchased the Sony - WH-1000XM3 which unfortunately has BT 4.2. The range and latency of BT 5.0 is a huge factor. However, in reality I have been noticing some minor connectivity issues. Crackles and studders. Not awful, but annoying nonetheless for a headphone at this price point. The ANC is excellent, but the additional pressure it places in the cup can be a little tiring if you are sensitive to this phenomenon, which I am. The conversation button is crazy. It turns on the external mics and feeds them into the headphones making the headphones almost transparent. It's similar to ANC Level 0, but upon depressing the button it also pauses what you are listening to."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-04-29,Discovering Sound!,"WOW!! These headsets are great! I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of headsets, BUT these are super comfortable. I love electronic music and the sound is so crisp. I'm definitely discovering sound! After using these headsets I was able to really listen and enjoy the sound. Another plus for Android and Google users: When setting up your headphones you can choose between Alexa and Google Assistant! We travel a lot and these are the best headphones I've ever used on a plane. My husband got his pair a while ago and we were able to test this. Real noise cancellation. We travel with an autistic kid, so when I'm telling you these are good it's because I have proof. Great product. I recommend 100%"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-04-29,Does not work with iOS,"The headphones do provide good noise cancellation and excellent sound quality. However, if you own an apple device, you’ll likely be disappointed. The Bose app, which is needed to configure the headphones is unable to connect to the headphones. I am able to pair the headphones using Bluetooth, but without the Bose app I can’t configure any of the features like selecting Alexa or Google assist. I googled this problem and found dozens of complaints. Bose posted a procedure to fix the problem, which involves trying to erase all traces of a blue tooth connection, but this didn’t work for me. Apparently, if you connect with bluetooth before you use the Bose app, the system breaks and you can’t recover. Or at least I couldn’t. Meanwhile, there is no warning on the installation procedure telling users NOT to pair the device without using the app.
According to the Bose web site, this problem is limited to apple devices. I’m going to arrange for a return."
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-10-31,Needs email + app; hurts my ears,"Want to get locked out of your headphones if you can't remember your password? There are slick features. The side of the headphone cup is a touchpad that you can swipe up/down/sideways on. There's a semi-realistic voice that talks to you. The app is elegant (and required). The noise cancellation is quite effective for quiet noise, but minimally so for speaking or speaking. For comparison, the amount of noise reduction from $30 foam ear muffs it much higher -- purely if you don't want to hear sound. As with prior generations of noise-cancelling earmuffs, within a few minutes I feel like my brain is being squeezed, especially at higher levels. It's unpleasant, and for my ears I need to go down to ~3/10 to minimally have that sensation."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-10-31,Amazing Quality and Functionality - Bose!,"Well there are headphones and then there are Bose. I have wanted a very good noise cancelling headphone for some time now - when I saw these I did the research and realized that I had found the perfect pair. What I Like:
These are the Limited Edition in a very nice white and light rose gold color that Bose call ""Soapstone"" - they would be a perfect match to anyone's rose gold Apple device. Since I mentioned Apple - lets talk about the construction of the 700s - the build quality is excellent - it could be mistaken for an Apple built device. Metal is used throughout with minimal plastic. Even with the metal construction - these are lighter than most over the ear headphones. They have a beautiful, futuristic, minimalist look. The sound quality is nothing short of amazing - it is a very immersive experience with rich lows, great mid range and crisp highs. Even my 58 year old ears could appreciate these! The noise cancelling is a wonderful feature - it works for both blocking outside sound while listening and for the microphone when you are making calls. Evidently there are 8 microphones - 6 are used for noise cancelling and the other two for your voice. I have made one call on these with my family in the room purposely making noise - my friend on the other end couldn't hear them! This would be great for outdoor calls or anywhere it's crowded. the noise cancelling worked great for me too - totally blocked my family's antics lol. This feature is very helpful for anyone with a hearing problem where background noise is an issue. You can also adjust the level of the noise cancelling if you are waiting for the mailman and need to hear, etc.
Bluetooth connected effortlessly - had these paired in less than a minute. No issues with connectivity. Battery life is very good - I had them on all day at work for a good 8 hours with no issues - this is superior to ear buds that I typically use as they last no more than five hours. Manufacturer claims 20 hours - this is great as I always charge daily and should never run out of power. These are super comfortable - the light weight coupled with the great quality ear cups makes for superior comfort - I prefer this style to earbuds as well. There is a free Bose app that allows you to customize settings. I downloaded but did not play with the app too much. Should be a great feature for audiophiles that really want to tweak to their liking. What I Would Improve:
Perhaps its the size of my head but these seem a little loose fitting - certainly helps with comfort but i could see these slipping off ones head when bike riding and hitting a hard bump, etc.
Although these are light and rather sleek, they are rather big to carry around - I can fit my earbuds in their charging case in my pocket with ease. These require dedication to transport lol - definitely more suited for home use - really the case with any quality ""over the ear"" headset. I really like these and couldn't be happier - my first Bose product and definitely not my last! HIGHLY recommend!"
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-03,Comfort and function,"My bottom-line is:
For relaxing on a plane and for taking calls I would pick these
For enjoying music anywhere else would pick B&O H9
I feel lucky to be able to review this set after owning B&O H9 and Sony WH1000XM3. I feel like the one I’m missing at this point is the new Sennheiser. Bose keep improving from earlier QC models – everything works so well now. The NC “Cabin pressure” feeling is completely gone, a thing of the past in all this segment. The voice prompts are a dream. App is smooth. Bluetooth connection is so quick and easy and with zero drops. Charging is quick. Battery life is amazing. The assistant button is easy and works great. The mic works well and these are perfect to conduct calls. The included carrying case is perfectly cute, compact and functional. The touch controls are great after some getting used to. Bose just nailed all this functionality items – Pretty amazing work!!! I feel like the future is here and this technology is just working. This is the 700's greatest strength along with comfort. As for design, we received the Soapstone color – it does not look cheap at all. I would say the look here is much more fun and fashionable then earlier QC picks. The 25/35 were a little geeky looking, this is a huge step up in term of design. The axis where the cups move and adjust on the headband looks so clean and feels very high quality. Comfort is so great. Very soft ear pads, pressure is just right. They do feel a little heavier then I imagined they will be but still magically light for what they do. Now I have to talk about the sound and musicality – Initially I couldn’t enjoy music on this Bose set. I have to deduct a star for it. The music was pretty flat with weak bass, it sounds a little “cardboardy”. The highs are one dimensional, they do not sizzle and pop. Human voice reproduction is average and tiring after a while suffering from the lackluster highs. To try and give burn-in a chance I plugged them using the analog cable to my laptop and played loud pink noise and frequency sweeps overnight. I was happy to find that it actually really helped by making the bass tighter and louder (I think that is the change I’m hearing) – it sounds better but still lags behind my other two wireless NC pairs in sound quality. I tried several musical genres from classical and world acoustic to electronic, metal and pop and could not find a song where they really shine. So these won’t be my first choice for music, podcasts and audiobooks. I am very spoiled by the H9 which I feel are IMO far superior in terms of sound. I would also rate H9 higher for build and material. WH1000XM3’s sound is also a bit better. The Bose win in term of comfort and function. So once again – choose these for the outstanding functionality. Enjoy the comfort and the look. Note that this is not a superior musical experience."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-03,Superb,"These have been insanely good headphones. The cushions around the ears are the most comfortable, ever. After a few minutes you dont even feel them anymore, you just have this great sound blasting in your ears. When I first opened them, I hit the bluetooth button and immediately got a notification on my phone asking if I wanted to pair. I clicked yes, and that was that. They were connected. Opened Amazon Music and picked a slipknot album. Lawd. Amazing sound and you hear everything. Went to some rap albums, r&b, still great. Better than great. Then I looked at the booklet and it said to download the app for all features and to setup the headphones. So I went ahead and did that even though I was already connected and happy. After downloading, it had me create a Bose account and add the headphones. You can add other bose products if you have them. It also had me reconnect to my phone, so I had to unpair the original connection before it connected through the app. You can add your music services. I added my Amazon Music account and my Sirius account. Surprisingly, the sound was better, louder, when connected through the app. I initially had to turn it down a notch once it connected that way. It picked up right where it left off with the previous connection straight to my phone though, which was nice. I didnt have to go in and pick what I wanted to hear again. Slipknot was already there with a play button. I tapped it and went about my business cleaning the house in pure happiness. I've been using them daily ever since. When the headphones update, it doesn't interfere with your music. Itll show a notification that it is updating, but your music isnt interrupted. The app walks you through the controls which are really intuitive and well thought out. It just makes sense and the motions are easy to remember for each action. You can adjust the noise canceling level and it is really good. From complete noise cancellation to being able to hear exactly what you want. You can set 3 levels of cancellation as favorites. When you turn the headphones on it automatically opens at full, so you have to change it to what you want in the app if you dont want full cancellation. I have not a single complaint about these. For over the ear headphones, they're superb. The weight and comfort level is amazin and I couldnt ask for anything more with the sound. Battery life is excellent. Even at 30% it gives 7+hrs of use left. If I encounter any issues, I will update, but as of now these are amazing."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-04,Futuristic look but app needs catching up,"These headphones look smokin hot! So futuristic and awesome! Sound is exceptional and noise cancellation is spot on. 11 levels of noise should be enough to satisfy everybody’s taste. Tried these at our park salsa night and heard nada. Nothing ! I can use my Siri too and ask her to make a phone call for me or navigation. Great sound having conversation both ways. Touch controls are very responsive and intuitive, they work perfectly and just make sense. Swipe up to increase the volume,swipe down to decrease, forward for next track backward for previous track - that kind of intuitive. Easy to adjust the headband, I don’t have issues with comfort at all and most headphones bother me. They don’t fold and only way to store them is with their case. I actually prefer this design but the case is quite big. App is frustrating and in my personal opinion Bose is asking for far too many unnecessary things. Unless you do all that, create account, agree to terms etc you can’t use your $400 headphones which I yet have to justify despite all the pros."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-06,Premium Performance/Features,"Of the 8 microphones hidden throughout the Bose Headphone 700s, two are dedicated to listening for your own voice. This is great because I can hear myself through the headphones when I am taking a call with them, and when I am talking with someone when I am out and about with them. I like this ability because I can maintain an appropriate volume when speaking. This feature is especially useful when combined with the adjustable active noise cancelling (ANC.) A button on the left earcup can cycle ANC between high, low, or off. If I need to speak with someone in person, I can cycle the ANC to a lower level and easily speak with them because I can hear my voice without having to remove the headphones or completely stop listening to music. The ANC itself is outstanding without some of the comprises of other ANC headphones. First, the ‘vacuum pressure” feeling of ANC that I detect with my other ANC headphones is practically non-existent on the 700’s. I love ANC, but it can often create a strange “vacuum” of pressure on your ears. Not so with these. Sound quality is also excellent. My music sounds crisp and clear. Bose strives to deliver music as accurately as possible. My past Bose products have always recommended not using EQ settings so you can hear the most accurate and “true” version of the music as intended by the artist. Not everyone prefers this accuracy, however, especially people like me who love emphasized bass. I’ve been listening to music on the Bose 700s, however, without any EQ settings and I have been very pleased. Just keep in mind these are not Beats – out of the box they will not make your head feel like an extra subwoofer brimming with bass. If you want natural sound with exceptional clarity, Bose is a great choice. These have two buttons on the right for on/off/pairing and accessing a digital assistant. A button on the left cycles through the ANC levels. Everything else is a touch control on the front side of the right cup. I normally despise touch controls but these are pretty intuitive and most importantly, actually work. Slide a finger forward or back to skip or move back tracks. Slide up or down to control volume. Double tap to play or pause. The headphones are also quite comfortable. They completely cover my ears versus resting on my ears. They charge via USB C which is great, and the battery life is fantastic at around 20 hours. So far, the Bluetooth range is also pretty generous without skips or dropouts, even though I may be another part of my house. Phone calls are very clear, and callers can clearly hear my voice. I have another pair of premium ANC headphones that I rarely use for calls because people tell me that I sound underwater, so I don’t take call quality for granted. On the downside, these are not inexpensive ANC headphones. Primary competitors are a bit cheaper although there are also more expensive options. I also don’t like being required to download and register the Bose app. In a time of heightened digital privacy concerns this seems like a dubious requirement but one nevertheless present with so many products. Overall, however, these offer a great combination of premium features and performance and I do not hesitate in recommending them, especially if you demand premium audio performance."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-06,Sublime!,"Thoughts:
They come in a nice box and a very nice vinyl zippered pouch. Easy to use and set up. Noise cancellation can be 0, 5, 10. Worked outstanding. Taking a call on the headphones while next to washer/ dryer or bathroom fan. Crystal clear call and music. Sounds is perfect! Bass is wonderful. It has button you can use with either Google or Alexa. You can you use any voice command to flip through songs or initiate a phone call. There's a finger sensor on the ears to answer phone calls. Head band on these is super cushioning making them extremely comfortable. Really best set of headphones/ Bluetooth buds I've gotten in years. Exceptional pair of headphones!!! The battery life on these is crazy-in a good way- 20+ hour's of use it tells you exactly how much is left. Intelligence & convenience, stylish, comfort all excellent! Details:
Keep your phone in your pocket and your head up to the world with easy access to voice assistants for music, navigation, weather, and more. Confidently take a call or speak to Alexa in any environment, with an unrivaled adaptive microphone system that isolates your voice from surrounding noise. Personalize your environment with 11 levels of noise cancelling — control distractions or let ambient sound in. Optimized for Amazon alexa and the Google Assistant. Access your voice assistant with a simple button press. Listen comfortably for hours — a streamlined, lightweight stainless-steel headband and angled ear cups make for a perfect fit."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-06,Audio Augmented Reality and Noise-Canceling Excellence,"My expectations of the Bose Noise Canceling 700's were that they would be good, but I didn't expect how comfortable they would be to wear, their solid battery life or how well they would work for phone calls in addition to actual noise-canceling ability, voice assistance, and music playback. The reason I give them 4 and not 5 stars are that they took several tries to pair with the Bose Music app (could be the app, my iPhone 8, or the headphones... I think it was the app), there's a navigation learning curve and no documentation that makes that easier. I also noted that on my pair of headphones if I turn my head and don't have the headphones on perfectly, the metal connection at the earpieces can be heard moving, even if music is playing. In the box, you get a semi-rigid hard case for the headphones, a 3.5mm line-in cable, the 700's, and a USB-C to USB charging cable. The USB-C connectivity is one of this model's upgrades. There's also a ""start here"" booklet that other than telling you to get the Bose Music app and install it, is fairly useless. Most of the booklet is in different languages and relates to warnings more than the use of the product. Install the app on your phone first, then press the Bluetooth button on the 700's to get started. In the app Settings go to Product Tour to learn how to use your 700's. -----------------------------------------------------
What I liked about this product:
1. The earcups are so soft and squishy! Very comfortable. 2. The included case is smooth and won't snag or drag. It has a magnetic compartment for cables and cutouts that fit the 700's just right. 3. The adaptable, always-on noise-canceling powers with these is fantastic! Even without music playing and typing on my noisy keyboard, I didn't hear anything with it on level 10. Outside - same experience. You can also select one of 11 noise-canceling levels to really customize your experience. Really impressive! You can customize up to 3 levels of noise cancelation and have your 700's remember your settings if that feature is toggled on in settings. Otherwise, the headphones go to full noise cancelation by default when powered on. 4. Nuances in music that I had never heard, I heard with these. I own another pair of Bose over-ear headphones that are probably 3 years old and in that time Bose has made some nice leaps forward in terms of their sound reproduction. 5. Call quality for me and for the person I'm calling is excellent with these headphones. The 700's have (8) microphones - divided between the two earcups. Ideal for working in a noisy environment and taking calls. The headphones are able to filter out all the background noise and just focus on your voice. Even in a crowded coffee shop with music playing, my caller heard my voice and not all the background noise. 6. Enabling several music services with the app is a nice feature. I tend to use Spotify and Amazon, and both are supported along with Pandora and iHeart Radio. 7. Voice assistants' support for Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa is a nice feature that works well. 8. Bluetooth connectivity remained stable at distances up to 25' in my house when walking room to room with the headphones on and my iPhone 8 in another room. 9. They just look good. Not overly bulky, these over-ear headphones look good on everyone. 10. Stainless steel frame construction means they are sturdy and are unlikely to snap with multiple on-off sessions per day. Earcups are plastic but seem equally sturdy. The earpads are fully replaceable which is good, considering they are very soft and feel like they might tear if they snag an earring. There's an ""R"" and an ""L"" inside each earcup, making it easy to know that you've got them on just right. 11. If you cup one of your hands over the right earcup you can cut the music to hear the remaining battery level. I got about 6 hours out of the box, but on a full charge, they are rated for up to 20 hours making them ideal for an overseas flight or full-day use. The app said I'd have 11 hours and I got about 6 hours on my first use, so one of them is lying, but either way, it was good. A quick 15-minute charge can yield up to 2 hours of playback. A full charge takes between 2.5 and 3 hours. 12. You can pair the 700's via Bluetooth with two devices simultaneously. 13. Gesture navigation versus physical buttons works well for people with large fingers and gives the 700's a sleek look. The right-handers will love this, but left-handed users won't. I'm not sure if they have left-handed 700's, but I doubt it. 14. The auto-off feature in Settings can be set to preserve battery life. 5, 20, and 40, and 60-minute options in addition to after 3 hours are available. ""Never"" is the default setting. -----------------------------------------
What I wish was better about the 700's...
1. I have a large head and the crossbar (over the top of my head) while padded nicely produced some discomfort after less than 1 hour of use. Unfortunately, the fit is fixed and will accommodate most, but may produce discomfort for some. 2. The white/cream color is very pretty, but it has a matte finish and I think in very short order, it will show any fingerprints or dirt, so keep a cloth handy to wipe them down after use. These would not be ideal for gym wear for this reason. 3. No documentation about how to use the features was strange. I realize there is a tutorial (Product Tour) in the app, but really it would have been nice to have both since some users don't understand that's how things work in the digital world and they still might be interested in these headphones. 4. The included case is nice, but the zipper is flimsy and the fit of the headphones is really snug up against the zipper. Users will want to be careful zipping and unzipping the case for these reasons. 5. It's really easy to bump the sensitive buttons on the earcups. They are almost flush on the 700's and very sensitive. 6. The cup your hand to pause feature didn't work well for me because my hands are small. I needed to use the physical button to pause and enable Conversation Mode instead. 7. Gesture navigation takes some getting used to and is done on the right earcup, so left-handed users won't be happy. It's not overly-sensitive which is important for avoiding false commands (like when your hair brushes the earcup), but that can also be annoying. I didn't find it easy to use with my small fingers and practice will be needed to gain some mastery. --------------------------------------------
AR Soundscapes are here and the 700's have an ""in"". The Bose 700's have the Bose AR feature and while the technology is new and there's a limited amount of content, this is great stuff! If you have patience, you should be rewarded with amazing new experiences. In addition to the Bose Music app, install an app called Bose Radar and lay back to enjoy a drool-worthy, immersive audio experience! --------------------------------------------------
The Bose Noise-Canceling Bluetooth 700's are really nice headphones - as expected. They are the best in terms of noise-canceling I've ever used and the sound reproduction is exceptional. Comfort is very good but may be slightly uncomfortable for users with big noggins. The lack of documentation for use with the product could be frustrating, but the Bose Music app has that information. Gesture navigation isn't perfect, but it's pretty good and an upgrade for those of us used to button fumbling. Overall, I'm very pleased. New features include new audio driver updates and USB-C charging. Default settings for noise-canceling on three levels (none - medium - maximum) can be adjusted further with 11 levels in the app. If you are looking for noise-canceling, over-ear headphones for music, calls, and voice assistant access, these are a great choice and worth the expense if you are an audiophile, world-traveler, commuter or work in headphones all day. ------------------------------------------------

Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-07,"I wish they were foldable, but still beautiful...","After 11 years finally Bose, refines the design of it's noise cancelling headphones. Past Bose noise cancelling headphones where not much to look at, we're talking design wise the old look for me, it felt it relates to business class headphones, something a dad would wear on a business trip, but the new Bose 700 are certainly not that, don't get me wrong, they are still classy but with new edgy beautiful look. These new Bose 700 headphones are absolutely beautiful and striking to look at, they have this modern design, with that headband that flows in the ear cups of the headphones and a striking lines of the exterior of each ear cup and integrate beautifully into this plush ear pads, and they swapped out the leather on the head band for a more futuristic rubber. All of that makes this headphones, all quite beautiful, not something we normally expect from a company like Bose, which used to focus on mainly old buyers, who can afford their price tags. So let's talk about differences about this Bose 700 and the older quite comfort 35 II, which are still great noise cancelling headphones:
In terms of noise cancelling, honestly they are both very on par with each other, but I feel maybe the QC 35 II is a slightly better, in some noisier situation. Bose spent years and years, decades even developing their noise canceling technology, and it's still some of the best even with last years QC 35 II it was still some of the best noise cancelling after Sony. So you get a small leap in Bose 700 as it has a slightly better passive noise isolation, so they start from a better point, when employing their noise cancellation technology. But really you're not going to notice a dramatic difference, between the noise reduction in QC 35 II and the 700, but what you will notice is the significantly better battery life, the bose 700 do 20 hours with noise cancelling on and a whopping 40 hours with noise cancelling off, that's pretty awesome. The main thing that Bose are trying to sell on Bose 700 are the call quality, it has 4 different microphones on each ear cup, and they are aimed at making the call quality experience on this headphone, absolutely perfect, they are designed to cut out background noise, to really focus on your voice, to make it so that, if you're working in a busy noisy environment like in a coffee shop or a quite office, it will still sound the same to your coworkers on that conference call. And that's why I think, this headphone is perfect for people who do alot of business that requires alot of conference calls, specially when traveling, the noise reduction is awesome, now the battery life will last you 20 hours, almost an entire day of flying with noise cancellation ON, and then when you get on that conference call in the airport, you'll be able to hear your co workers and they will be able to hear you absolutely perfectly. In terms of controls, the Bose 700 has not too many buttons compared to the older QC 35 II. There is a button on the left side that adjusts the noise cancelling level of the headphones, and on the right side there is a button that allows you to access your google assistant, Siri or Alexa, above that you'll find the Bluetooth pairing and off button, that's all the buttons you get, thats because on the right side of the headphone, there is a touch pad that allows you to change songs and adjust volume, which is pretty annoying to me, I get confused of the gestures sometimes, but it's very responsive and acts very well when you're on the go. The sound quality, you can notice the moment you listen to them, there is a little bump in the middle range, compared to their old QC 35 II, which you can hear very well in guitar strings, things like synthesizers and voices. Regarding the high end of the sound gets a boost as well with a very nice sheen and definition, that could be a determent in high volumes, but to be honest, I think this head phones sound great and really bring up the definition of the music. They are a little bit less flat, than the QC's where and a little bit less bass response, which I prefer, because you can literally boos the songs over even amps to the max and you'll never get distortion what so ever. In the upper midrange, it makes things like jazz, soul or acoustic music, anything with that upper midrange that you kinda want some shimmer in, it really makes it come out. Overall, they are defiantly an improvement over QC 35 II and they are by far the best headphones the company made so far, it has the best and most beautiful design in the headphones industry so far with very sturdy frame. The only down side, is that you can't fold them, like the Sony WH-100 III and you have to use the Bose case."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-07,Cutting Edge Smart Integration w/ Bose Audio Perfection,"I am a fan of this latest offering from Bose. These 700 series with Alexa Voice Control are easy to use. This is my experience. I opened the box and directions told me to download the app. On my phone I then proceeded to learn how to operate my headphones. The directions are easy, intuitive and even learning how to operate these headphones was fun. I love the one touch swipe to raise volume, lower, skip, back up, just great. The headphones themselves are super comfy because the ear cups are large and fit over my head without crushing my ears. I have had these phones playing for hours and still have hours left before I need to recharge. That is fantastic. Noise cancellation is controlled by you. I can shut out the world with these Bose 700's. I can also use my Alexa by voice and talk on the phone without distortion or interference. And no clunky microphone in front of my face. I did begin to feel the weight of these headphones after a few hours. My only complaint. Of course the Bose quality is there with sound quality (music) that is divine. I love using the voice control with Alexa, keeping my phone in my leggings or deep in my pocket. I can control my house with my headphones! I really enjoy my time spent with these headphones. My bottom line for these headphones is that I was able to set them up easily for use with Alexa, sound is fantastic, and I can shut out the world while controlling all my smart things. I can make phone calls and talk normally all hands free. No longer do I have to hold the phone. Love it."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-09,"If you care about sound quality, features, comfort, and quiet.... buy these","I am going to keep this shortish and sweet and say that these are the NICEST headphone I have ever owned. *The sound quality is crystal clear and the noise canceling is almost spooky with how effective it is. *They weigh a lot, but the materials are so soft and well made that I hardly notice after a couple of hours in my own world. *My favorite feature though is how the bluetooth functions. Once synced, taking them off and setting them down for a while turns them off, while pressing the bluetooth button turns them right back on. And when you start them up for the first time that day, it tells you what its connected to AND how much battery life is left. I believe I started with 18hrs, which is plenty of time considering I use them for a couple hours a day. Spend the money and buy these. PS: my friend at work has the black ones and the white looks way better"
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-12,ALMOST PERFECT FOR EVERYONE (BUT NOT ME)!,"This Vine offer was a timely one because it is time to replace the Bose QC20 noise-cancelling ear buds I presently use. They've done their job admirably for the two years I've owned them but the battery is feeling its age. This offer was timely because the design of the QC20's I use is dated, having a chord that requires a hole to plug in to; my next phone won't have one. I also know that I will not be buying the non-chorded Bose ear buds apparatus that replaced the QC20'sn because of the mixed reviews, many one star. I LOVE the old QC 20's though, and if the new iphones had a jack for them I would buy another set, my fourth but this review is about the Bose 700's. Here's what is good about them: Fantastic Battery LIfe! ; Rapid Charging; Comfortable Fit; Interesting Design; Excellent Touch Controls (though the button controls are just okay); Superior Sound Reproduction; Excellent Noise Cancelling; Fantastic Telephone Call Functionality. I was amazed to find these headphones charge to nearly 20 hours of use. That is even more than the QC20's when new and the QC20 battery capacity if fantastic. I was further amazed that these phones charge as quickly as they do; plugging them in for just 15 minutes gives them an extra 2-3 hours of play: I like that! Stylistically, these phones are going to appeal to females more than men, and younger men more than older men, I think. The color (soapstone) expecially is more of a feminine color than black, I think. I have an aversion to black headphones because of the way they look but these soapstones are no better. I felt very self-conscious wearing them which is the major reason why I won't continue to use them even though the actual design places them right close in on the head, much like a quality set of ear muffs. I considered getting a hoodie jacket to wear whilst driving but couldn't bring myself to do this which is a shame because call quality of these is SUPER. The call quality of these is actually unbelievably good. I simply could not believe that people speaking to me on the phone could hear me so clearly for the simply reason that I have no idea where the microphones for voice conversation are. Nevertheless, when I asked people on the other end of the line whether they could hear me well, I was told that I sounded better than I ever have (have been using QC20's for about 6 years). In addition, the music controls for listening to spotify work surprisingly well. It was literally surprising to me that just by swiping a finger on the right ear cup I could increase and decrease volume, and skip backwards and forwards by one song, the backwards feature is one not available with the QC20. I wasn't as keen on the tapping of the ear cup to answer and end calls because one really 'feels' those taps and it is kind of uncomfortable, but it gets less annoying over time, at least. The sound reproduction of these phones is superior as well. It is not spectacular, of course, because one is always aware of the ambient noise even after noise-cancellation, and even in a quiet room one can tell that while the sound reproduction is superior, it could be improved. One hoped that the accompanying Bose music app would give one the ability to make EQ adjustments, but this is not the case. Doubtless it will be a feature in a future update of the app, but until then what you hear is what you get from these headphones. Finally, the noise-cancellation feature is top shelf. It really is excellent. Does it create total silence? No!, but what it does do is tamp down loud ambient noise to a level where one is aware there is outside noise but it doesn't matter because one can hear music, phone calls or (relatively) nothing with a minimum of distracting sound. What I don't like about these, and what has caused me to look for a set of in-ear noise cancelling ear buds is as follows:
Their Look and their ear cover. Yep, I was just unable to get around the fact that, no matter what, using these requires one to wear a headpiece that causes people to look at one's head as he walks along the sidewalk, drives, or even just sits there. I don't like drawing attention to myself in this way. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Having said that, I imagine that this would be considered a Feature to some people who like to show off the brands and gear they wear and own. I go completely the other way on this issue. The other thing that I couldn't get over about these is that they fit completely over the ear: DUH! Yes, I knew this, I just didn't know that my ears and head would tire of wearing them after about one hour. In contrast, I can wear my QC20's for at least 4 hours before I even begin to think I might like to remove them from my ears, and I wear them constantly throughout the day, taking them out only when I am speaking to people or eating. Otherwise, they are always plugging in to the old ear sockets. I couldn't do this with the 700's. Even though the 700's are remarkably light and well-fitting, my ears just get claustrophobic from being covered up all of the time. Also, if truth be known, I like the feeling of freedom that comes from having just ear buds. It means that one moves one's head in a natural way without thought. Wearing a set of headphones never gives one a similar sense of freedom. This is an excellent product and I recommend it to everyone to try. Only some of you will, like me, decide they aren't a good fit. The rest of you lot will love 'em. Recommended."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-11-12,Comparison: Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Summary: Comfortable and Great Noise Reduction, But Pricey
Update 1/21/20:
The headphones continued to have Bluetooth connection issues. So Bose tried again and sent me a third pair. I was beginning to give up hope, but this third pair seems to somehow to have fixed the issue (so far). They continue to work. Update 12/11/19:
The Bose headphones have died (completely unresponsive)! Normally, I would reduce the star rating, but Bose customer service made returning the headphones for replacement quick and painless. The BEST customer service! The new headphones don’t seem to have any issues (so far) with Bluetooth connectivity. FYI: 3M WorkTunes Bluetooth hearing protector earmuffs (mentioned below) don’t have the sound quality or comfort of Bose, but continue to impress for extra noisy applications. Update 12/3/19:
Bluetooth continues to be not quite stable on the Bose - which requires a reset. They continue to impress for their comfort and impressive noise cancellation. As noted below, I much prefer the Sony WHCH700N for sound quality. FYI: I have obtained a pair of 3M WorkTunes (hearing protector earmuffs). They are comparable to the Stanley headphones (see below), but at half the price and WITH Bluetooth. The 3M headphones also have much better bass, and somewhat better sound than Stanley with comparable levels of noise blocking. SUMMARY:
I want to give Bose 5 stars for its impressive noise reduction and comfort, but it has a high price, and not quite perfect sound. So 4 stars. My objective here is to compare it to various much lower price alternatives. Anker Life NC has slightly less noise reduction, but with equal or better sound quality. Sony WHCH700N (see picture) has better sound, but noise cancellation is only modest (Sony’s flagship WH1000MX3 was not available to me). I threw Stanley earmuffs in because of its great passive noise reduction (although no Bluetooth). BOSE 700 EVALUATION:
PRO
Bose impressively mutes high frequencies e.g. airplane cabin noise
Reduces sound of nearby conversations
Noise reduction did not cause hiss and only slight “pressure”
Sound quality is good overall
15 min charge gives 3.5 hr battery life; 2.5 hr to fully charge
Very comfortable to wear for extended periods
Touch gestures (controls) are intuitive
Conversation Mode pauses audio and gives full awareness (hold Noise Control button 1 sec)
Classy design
Will work without the useless Android app
CON
Bose is very pricey! NOT a replacement for hearing protection ear muffs
Not very good at deep bass and sound can be sibilant (bright)
Bluetooth connectivity problems sometimes require a reset (turning off and on)
Android app does not have equalizer or sound profiles
App cannot be accessed until headphones are connected
The 3 physical buttons cannot be reprogrammed
Headphone case is nice, but not compact
Power adapter is not included
20 hr battery life compared to 35 hr with Sony
On-line tutorial, but no manual (not even a “pdf”)
COMPARISON TESTING (see picture):
I evaluated muting of exterior noise WITHOUT raising the music volume to ear damaging levels. I tested the following headphones (from high to low price) with various music including Copland: Quiet City, Tom Waits: Closing Time, and Inception movie soundtrack:
1. Bose 700,
2. Anker Life NC,
3. Sony WHCH700N,
4. Stanley Sync Digital AM/FM/MP3 Earmuff (NRR = 25),
5. Yinyoo KZ ZSN Over Ear Earbuds (claimed NRR= 26). WIRED ALTERNATIVES:
Yes, I have included 2 non-Bluetooth headphones as economical alternatives (see above). Neither has active noise cancellation, but its the end result that matters. STANLEY is legit with NRR = 25 (2 AA batteries). It’s sound quality is fairly good, but it has a high clamping force on the head. YINYOO claims that it is a “high performance headphone with a dynamic driver and a balanced armature” (see also theverge.com “The Wonderful World Of Chinese Hi-Fi). Although cheap, it had great sound. Unfortunately, the 26 NRR is bogus (yes, I first checked to see if I had a good seal to my ear) - I didn’t evaluate it further. CHARGING:
Charging Bose is initially quick, but then slows down. Battery charge was measured by the headphone or Bose app (in hours), and by my Pixel 3XL phone in % charge (note: less accurate). I ran the battery down until it shut off, and then charged using a Google Type C USB PD power adapter: 30 min charge was 40% (7.5 hr), 60 min 70% (14 hr), 90 min 100% (18 hr), and it took a total of 2.5 hr to finish 100% (20 hr). In comparison Sony had 35 hr battery life, while Anker had only a 10 hr battery life. SOUND QUALITY:
SONY – Sony is my favorite for its excellent, balanced, expansive sound and deep base. YINYOO – Really good sound quality. I didn’t evaluate it further (it didn’t reduce noise). BOSE - Really good, but it is sibilant for voices and music can be harsh. It has weak deep bass. ANKER – Equal quality as Bose, but with less harshness and more deep bass (normal sound profile). STANLEY - Good sound for a hearing protector. It’s not quite in the same league as the others, but there are situations where only Stanley will do. AIRPLANE NOISE:
STANLEY - Very good; good for nearby conversations and kids crying. BOSE - TBD, but I know it will be very good. Only fair blocking of conversations. ANKER – Effective, but not for quiet music, solo vocals. NOTE: since it is in ear, an earmuff hearing protector can be put on top (not very elegant). SONY – Its modest noise cancellation worked OK on quiet planes. POWER SANDING (5” circular sander):
STANLEY - Best. BOSE - Removed most high-frequency and some mid-frequency noise. ANKER - OK, but let through more noise than Bose. SONY - Don’t bother. VACUUMING (Kenmore full size):
BOSE, ANKER, STANLEY - All effective. SONY - Barely OK. HOOVER HAND-HELD VACUUM (with a rotating brush - 30” from ear):
STANLEY - Best. BOSE - I had to turn up the volume a bit, but the music was fine. ANKER - OK, but let through more noise than Bose. SONY - Don’t bother. STIHL BACKPACK LEAF BLOWER (gas engine):
STANLEY - Not perfect, but the ONLY thing that works. BOSE, ANKER, SONY - YIKES! NO!! A lot of noise and the music was inaudible."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-14,Excellent Quality,"Prior to these headphones, I have only used one other pair of noise cancelling headphones. This is my first pair of Bose headphones. My first impression after unboxing is that these headphones are beautiful! I have seen people with the older models of the Bose headphones, and I did not like the way they looked. The ""soapstone"" headphones are white and rose gold. These are VERY easy to setup in comparison to the other headphones I had. The app really makes things super straightforward, and within a few seconds, I had them set up, connected, and ready to go. I was very easily able to add a second device to connect them too (my computer) with zero issues. I was extremely impressed with the ease of setting these up, as I had issues adding a second device with the other pair of noise cancellation headphones I had. These headphones feel a little bit flimsy, but they are built to be very lightweight, so I think that is why they feel that way. They are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and they are not bulky. I frequently wear them for several hours while I am studying, and I never have any headaches or discomfort. The noise cancellation and sound quality are outstanding. The battery life is very good. I charged these headphones once, and they lasted me an entire week of using them for a few hours a day for noise cancellation during studying. The downside is that the price is very high, but these are very high quality compared to the other set of noise cancelling headphones that I had. I think that based on the quality, these headphones are worth the price."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-16,Superb sound quality and noise cancellation. Very comfortable.,"Superb headphones, right on-par with our QC 35 ii headset. My wife loves the style and comfort. Sound is well-balanced and rich through all ranges. The noise cancellation is excellent (and adjustable), and the comfortable headphones disappear, allowing for an immersive experience. IMHO, they are more comfortable and immersive than my Beats Studio headphones. Superb headphones that we highly recommend!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-11-22,Better for The Pixies than Mingus -Very Easy Set Up - Slight Learning Curve Due to Simplisity,"I have an Alexa and used a 9+ to pair with the headphones. I've tested the headphones on Spotify as well as other phone apps and it has worked very well so far. The sound when I played The Pixies including ""Debaser"" was fantastic for the sound effects on Stereo. The process of downloading the app and pairing it with the device as well as signup was mostly effortless. The need for it to look at a contacts list is because of the ability to make phone calls through the earphones. Many of these options can be turned off after allowing or secondary programs that can be used to block. The headphones for my fairly large noggin' fit nicely. I can tell as I put them on and off the essential ""seal"" for noise cancellation. I wouldn't recommend wearing these in the gym, however. As you can pair with BlueTooth and use the phone and downloaded materials there really isn't a need for a constant internet connection on flights or in other areas. My headphones show between 18 & 19 hours of use after charging. So far, the pressing buttons, timing for how long, and while wearing them finding one and not the other, etc., has taken some time. Also, $400 is somewhat steep. Of the sound, I find the bass resonance to be less than ideal for music by Mingus and Pastorius. However, The Pixies and the like...fantastic! :)"
Bose,NC700,2,0,2019-11-24,Beware Bose Bloatware,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Bose products in general and of Bose noise-cancelling headphones in particular. I've owned two pairs of their top-of-the-line wired NC 'phones and love them for their comfort, effectiveness, and amazing sound. So I expected such great things from these. But it was not to be. I didn't realize these required a download of proprietary software to use. Honestly -- that's kind of a d!ck move and I'm getting tired of companies doing this. It's nothing but a way to track you and sell your data, and with what we're learning about Chinese cyber-spying on consumers, we should all be very careful about downloading unnecessary product apps and waiving so many privacy rights, as you have to do just to use these. Plus, who needs the extra app to clog up their phone's memory? Most of us want to streamline our phones, not install bloatware. And the bloatware is buggy, to boot! When the phones do work, they sound great, of course. But I resent the app, and therefore I resent these phones. Back to plain old phones that play nice with plain old Bluetooth. See you when you wise up, Bose."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2019-11-30,Randomly would power off or disconnect from bluetooth.,ended up returning product due to random power off or bluetooth disconnect issues. Not sure what is going on at Bose but the quality of the products seems to be declining.
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-12-12,Bummer that the app stopped working,"These things are the cream of the crop, the king of the jungle, the heavyweight headphones of the world.... but someone messed up with the app. I was able to set up and it worked fine and I haven’t been able to connect since to my iPhone. I restarted, re-pair , deleted the app and reinstalled. All to no avail. Now back to what makes them great. The material quality is what the rest of the industry will be trying to copy or at least should try to copy because man is it great to the touch. Wish everything was made out of what these things are made of. The carrying case has a neat compartment to store your cables in too and while small and compact their direct competition is smaller. Also the battery life could use some beefing up so that’s why they still get a 4 and not 5."
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-12-14,"Excellent performance, big improvement with phone conversations.","These are all around very good headphones. I have a 3 year old pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 35’s that are having issues with the power button, I am happily replacing them with the 700’s. First off, the biggest improvement I noticed between the 700’s and the QC 35 is a vast improvement in conversations on the phone. With my QC 35 headphones, the sound cancellation would turn off while on a phone call. Which meant if I was outside in the evening on a call, the sound of crickets would pierce the conversation. With the Bose 700, the additional microphones and improved noise cancellation means my voice is picked up very well, even in noisy environments, and the background noise is cancelled out. For example, to show how well the noise cancellation works on a call… I was outside in the cold sitting next to a forced air propane heater (when turned to full, it sounds a bit like a jet engine). While on a call, my friend couldn’t hear the propane heater until I stood up and was right next to it adjusting something. Up until then, it was just a normal conversation. Outstanding. There is a substantial change in the physical design of the Bose 700’s versus the QC 35’s. The QC 35’s are lighter and more compact, the Bose 700 are sturdier and heavier. There feels like an improved quality to that additional sturdiness. It took some getting used to as I switched to the Bose 700’s, but I am good with the change. They feel comfortable and non-taxing for long listening sessions. Reason for 4 of 5 stars. The Bose 700 controls are a mix of a few buttons (on/off Bluetooth, noise cancellation, virtual assistant – Alexa or Google) and touch sensitive controls (play/pause/stop, volume up/down, previous/next song, etc.). This is the only area where I feel the Bose 700’s fall short. I do not like the touch sensitive controls. I’ve used them on several headphones (Bang & Olufsen, others) and very much dislike the experience. Touch controls are a pain even in the best of conditions (worse with gloves in the cold) and I find the response to be inconsistent and frustrating. Sometimes I had issues pausing and resuming songs with the Bose 700’s. Sometimes I think I’m oriented to increase volume and instead I skip to the next song. Touch controls on devices keep coming in and out of fashion. I sincerely hope they go back out of fashion soon. The sound. I spent time comparing similar song passages of various genres on my Bose 700’s and QC 35. For me, the most notable improvement was in bass. Not more boomy, but tighter and more projected bass. It really came out on songs of a German band called Rammstein. Overall a slight improvement to the QC 35, but not huge. On sound alone, I wouldn’t upgrade. On sound AND the big improvement to phone conversations, I’d upgrade. TIPS…
Tip with the touch controls and the virtual assistant. If you use Alexa (haven’t tried with Google), if you press and hold the headphone touch control with a single touch (like pressing to pause, only holding the finger down)… the headphone will flip back and forth from listening for the “Alexa” wake up word. Then you can just use the push button. By the way, this only works if you have the Alexa app up and running on your smartphone (not just installed). Tip during installation via Bose Music app on smartphone. When using the Bose Music app, selecting the headphones can be VERY confusing. Through the app, when selecting an accessory (the headphones), it can take 30-40 seconds before ‘Bose nc 700 hp’ will show up. This is real-world 30-40 seconds which feels like eternity and that the app isn’t work. It is, just extremely slow. Overall… great headphones! Throw out touch controls, bring the buttons back!"
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-15,Love these headphones,"Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700, with Alexa Voice Control, Soapstone
I've been using these headphones for about a month now. The sound quality is outstanding. The highs and mids are clean and crisp. The bass is great, not amazing but it is rich and smooth. The ear cups are a bit on the smaller side for over the ear headphones. The head strap is a little tight. My head is pretty normal and they do feel snug. They are comfortable though so I can't complain about that too much. The app is pretty simple but you don't need it to connect the headphones. If you don't use the app you miss out on some of the functionality but they sound great with out it too."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2019-12-18,Don't believe the negative review at the top,"I'm not sure what the 1-star reviewer who has been voted up 3k+ times is smoking, and it's sad that they have been allowed to mislead so many readers--that review should 100% be deleted for false information. These headphones DO NOT require downloading their app or registering the product or invading your privacy to use (how dramatic) in order to be able to get them to work. You can use these with the auxiliary cable included or with Bluetooth and you don't even have to bother with Alexa if you don't want to (but the option is there should you choose it). They are, in fact, exceedingly useful headphones for a number of applications--I have used them at home, in studio and while traveling. To my ears, the noise cancellation and bass are upper tier in terms of quality. Bose will never reach the summit of audio quality, but they do manage to separate themselves from the pack while still keeping their prices at about what half of some of their competitors do. These would make for a very nice gift for an audiophile. Please research more than just one review when making a large purchasing decision such as this! !"
Bose,NC700,4,0,2019-12-24,Gorgeous sound,"I'm not a huge audiophile, just an average listener, and I am knocked out by how amazing these headphones sound! Not very surprised, as I know Bose's reputation, but still - I never knew how incredible my music could sound before putting these on! The sound is just so rich, so enveloping, I'm completely in love with it. I tend not to wear noise-canceling headphones normally; the idea of being so unaware of the outside world really makes me nervous, so I DEEPLY appreciate the ability to set the level of noise-canceling manually! Way down to 0 or 1 when I'm out in the world, maybe 4 or 5 around the house, and all the way up to 10 when I'm sitting next to a screaming baby on a plane. This is magnificent. The AR capability is something I'm really looking forward to seeing develop. Right now they just have a few odd games to play (which demonstrate how perfectly it works), but the potential to incorporate this technology for truly useful purposes is enormous. The execution from Bose is pretty flawless, you can close your eyes and really feel where sounds are originating feels like nothing short of magic. From a physical standpoint, the headset itself is beautiful, if a bit girly, which is perfect for me because my husband is definitely not going to be commandeering my rose gold headphones, these are MINE! I'm struggling a little to learn how to use the touch controls properly without looking, but I just need practice. The headset folds to fit into a compact, lightweight but very sturdy case. Inside the case, there is a small compartment that closes with a magnet (more elegant & far more durable than a snap) to hold the included cords: a USB-C charging cable, and a wired headphone connection, extremely useful for airplanes! A few drawbacks that keep them from being my favorite thing ever:
1) Setup is odd. I don't love having to install the Bose app and having to keep going back to it to control various things. I guess it makes sense because controlling the level of noise-canceling is not a standard thing. It seems to keep drawing you back in to deal with things through the app. It's not a major hardship, but I often just wish they would latch on via Bluetooth & be controlled like normal headphones. 2) Installing & setting up Alexa is actually optional, though they don't make it seem that way. They REALLY REALLY want you to do it. At first there were a lot of messages from the app & emails from Bose, urging me to set up Alexa. I DO NOT WANT ALEXA. My Google Assistant is already intrusive & annoying enough - and is also supported by these headphones, but you wouldn't think so based on all the Alexa flag-waving. 3) They don't fit great on my head! They seem to want to slide off the back of my head if I move around too much. I keep trying to find a better spot for them to sit, but if I'm running around cleaning or doing yardwork, yeah they are going to slide off more than once. The drawbacks are not a huge deal to me, and I still love the headphones, but they aren't perfect."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-27,Amazing headphones!,"The noise cancelling feature is excellent and the sound quality is A+, bass is a bit lacking but not by much. These headphones are a testament of a superb, minimal design, high quality build and excellent functionality. I didn’t think twice before buying them!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-28,Worth every penny!,Hands down best headphones I've ever had! I'm a truck driver and those big dogs are super noisy! This is money well spent for sure! Phone call quality is amazing! Beyond happy!

Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-30,Awesome looking and amazing sound quality but android app not so great.,"I use bose 700 headphones to listen audio books and youtube videos, not so much music and found it really awesome. How could bose disappoint you ever. I thing I didn't like is the android aap which doesn't work seamlessly but who cares, the headphones looks amazing and sound amazing."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2019-12-30,Quality,"No dislike. This is my 3rd set, not because they go bad but because family keeps taking them."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-01,Static in the left ear phone - Returning them,"I am returning this headphone because there is static in the left ear that should not be there when no music is playing. For comfort, I give these a solid 5 stars. The sound is pretty good - but it's not any better than competing units that are 4 times less expensive. The two main positive things about this unit is super comfort and very good looks."
Bose,NC700,1,0,2020-01-02,What Is Bose Thinking?,"I have always been a big fan of Bose. I like their speakers, and it suits both my taste in music and the sound qualities that I prefer. I have had a pair of Bose noise-cancelling headphones previously, which were a big disappointment when I was forced to toss away a perfectly good set of headphones because a ten-cent piece of plastic broke- with no opportunity to repair. I was hoping Bose improved their headphone game. === The Good Stuff ===
* I like the sound of these. I prefer music with a strong treble and midrange presence, with a de-emphasized base. These deliver on that. Notes and voices come through clear and sharp, and I hear a nice tone and not a lot of harsh overtones. * The headphones are reasonably comfortable. They can be a bit of a hassle to adjust, but once I got it right, I could leave them on for a few hours without them being annoying. * Phone calls were easy to hear, and people on the other end reported clear, sharp communication. * The noise cancelling feature was decent. It shuts down a good portion of nearby communication or office noise, and even works on more annoying sounds- chairs screaching, phones ringing, loud talkers. === The Not-So-Good Stuff ===
* I am still not sure I understand why headphones need their own app, and I am less sure of why they would need a buggy and ill-designed one such as this. I have no idea what the privacy agreement says, but I really don't need Bose monitoring my location (or my conversations?). It took several attempts to install the app on my iPhone, and even then I was never quite sure I had the right one. * Bluetooth connectivity is marginal at best. I have a $15 set of headphones that can keep connected through a whole day...while these drop out about once every two hours or so...more often in electronically noisy environment. * Battery life was not all that great. I seldom can listen continuously for long periods of time, so it was a bit hard to figure, but I think I got maybe 3-4 hours max at reasonable volumes with noise cancellation. === Summary ===
These were a disappointment. They sound quality was decent, but the bluetooth and app software was almost a joke. Bose should be embarrassed by these."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,"Pure, Exquisite, Comfortable, Noise cancelling Joy for your Ear Holes","The Bose 700 Series Headphones are an exquisite piece of technology. I've used Beats by Dré, Sony Headphones, Samsung ear buds and then I decided to purchase the high end Bose Quietcomfort II Headphones. Then I made the mistake of trying the Bose 700 demo headphones at Best Buy. I bought the Bose 700 Headphones the next day. Sleek, well crafted, extremely comfortable, amazing sound and varied options for your listening enjoyment. The noise cancellation feature melts away my wife's incessant nagging and my 3 kids Super Bowl level noise production and just about every other noise you can think of... Highly recommend the Bose 700 Headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-02,"Wow. Cream of the Crop (in Sound, Function and Color!)","Obviously the Bose sound is top tier, these things sound AMAZING, and I just run them with an $8 BT dongle in my cheesy Dell corporate PC at work. The noise cancellation is new to me and I was curious how that would actuially work, There are three positions: off, halfway and full blast. I dont know how Bose does it but at full blast, office background noise is GONE. I actually can't use that setting because I listen to classical music as I do programming... it gets so quiet with full noise cancelling, I'll go right to sleep! The halfway setting is just perfect. It filters out enough to allow you to concentrate but still be aware of the outside, like when the boss wants your attention, lol. Last, the off-white/rose gold finish looks like these cost a grand, REALLY nice. Bose products cost but the technology is crazy good. Full Alexa voice control if that works in your world. Awesome headphones."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-02,I am a Bose fan! Love these,"Bose never lets me down. They are well made. Extremely well made. I have the white ones. VERY PRETTY. Sometimes I worry taking my dog out in the early mornings, 4:00...3:00 A.M. because if someone is walking behind me, I will not hear them, so I keep the volume low or keep one ear muff off of one ear until I walk back inside. I love the little case it comes with. It is not bulky. Did I mention that I LOVE BOSE!!!!!! :)))))"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,Love these,The sound quality is amazing. Three noise cancellation during phone calls is unbelievable!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-05,Bose is the best!,I love the styling and the sound is wonderful. The app makes adjustments easy. No problems with Bluetooth connections. The case is very nice it has a storage space for the charging and connecting cords. My best Christmas gift to myself ever!😊

Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-09,Comfortable and high quality,I find these headphones to be great from every use of listening to music or talking on the phone. Phone use is important to me since I have poor hearing. A good buy for me.

Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-10,Good quality.,"Purchased this for my gf for christmas. These headphones are a little on the pricey side (I had purchased them before the price drop, they are a bit cheaper now), but the noise cancellation works well and the sound quality is about as good as any of the other higher end bose headphones to come out in the past year or so. they are also pretty stylish and in my opinion a bit femanine looking, but anyone can rock them."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-11,Worth the splurge,These headphones are beyond exquisite. They’re beautiful comfortable the sound quality is perfect and the ease of using them is super. Very modern and expensive vibe pure luxury worth it if you can splurge
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-11,Incredible for phone calls,"Bought these for phone calls - amazing quality, incredible noise cancellation. This is my 5th pair of Bose, from wired/bluetooth/buds/cans - quality keeps getting better, and these were well worth the cost."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-01-12,Great design but some flaws,"I love the design of these headphones, and the sound is very good, but the fact that the app doesn't include an equalizer is disappointing. Further, they have started exhibiting distortion and, apparently, this is an issue that affects many owners. I've submitted a support issue with Bose but the only thing they can do is replace them, which takes almost 2 weeks to complete and requires me to send them back before they'll send out the replacements. A support rep claimed the engineers are looking into the issue but I'm not really confident that a fix will be available before the time runs out for me to return them for a refund. I'll update this if a fix isn't provided before the return date."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-13,Great listening and you can decide how much noise you want to block out,So far I haven’t found anything I dislike about them. Use them to walk on treadmill and to listen to music. Going to download app to use for meditation
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-13,Absolutely amazing sound quality,I have been using Shure ear buds for the past 15yrs because I haven’t found a company that can compete with their sound quality. I always hear such good things about Bose so I thought I’d give them a try. This was my first pair of Bluetooth ear headphones and this is my takeaway. The control buttons on the side are big and easy to use. Once you download the Bose App connecting to Bluetooth is a breeze. The earphones are adjustable and very comfortable. Once I hit the play button that’s when it really happened for me. The sound quality is absolutely amazing the highs are crystal clear in the lows are quite impressive. I could hear every detail in the music I was listening to. After 15 yrs I’ve finally found the replacement to my old earbuds.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-13,Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700,Great headphones. They are easy to setup and sync. The sound quality is great and they are durably constructed.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-14,Great for travel!,I bought these for travel and they are absolutely amazing on the airplane! The noise canceling tech made it so I didn’t even hear the airplane’s humm
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-15,Perfect!!,Exactly what I was needing!!! Love them!
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-15,Overall good,"I like the sound, the noise cancellation, but I have to say it is not as comfortable as the all version. It doesn’t feel right on your head."
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-01-16,great phones,one small demerit is it can be shrill.sound and look great. controls not difficult to learn.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-17,The quality,"I use it for music, phone calls. Very clear"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-20,As you would expect of a Bose product. Pure excellence,These headphones not only cancel noise but are easily switched to listening mode to hear what is going on around you. Connects easily with my Android and Windows devices. Haven't tried it with an Apple product yet but plan to soon as I have an iPad mini and iMac.
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-01-21,Great outdoors,"Typically I use some Jabra earbuds on my walks, so I decided to compare these headphones to them on a walk. The sound quality is great, I can adjust the volume easily and I get clear voices. These perform better than my earbuds. The noise cancellation is about the same. I was able to block all external sound in both. While these headphones are comfortable, they are bulkier. I found these headphones are great for slower activities, like walks. Anything much more active, these weren't great. However, the sound quality is awesome."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-01-24,Great sound but too complicated to use,"The sound was great, but connecting to the headset was painful. couldn't just connect via bluetooth you have to use the bose app, terrible user experience and too complicated for a simple headset"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-26,Wife loves it,Very comfortable and sound quality in impeccable
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-27,Great quality,These are great! I bought them for my son for Christmas and he loves them! I would love to get a pair for myself.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-01-29,Love,LOVE LOVE LOVE
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-01,Excellent Noise Cancelling!,"Love the white and pink rose color! Tried the bowers and wilkins px7, and returned it for these bose 700 and not looking back, Sound and and bass are on point to my taste. And NC is Excellent."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-02-01,Connection issues,These headphones have the most connection issues out of all the headphones I have. With the price that I'm paying for I didn't expect I will be troubleshooting everything I want to use them. I recommend skip these and go for other options.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-02,Absolutely the best,"Absolutely the best quality, as expected from Bose!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-03,Love it!,Built very well and sound fantastic. Definitely recommend these headphones to anyone who’s a music enthusiast and loves listening to their James with the best sound possible.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-05,Perfect!,Works great!
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-06,QC35ii still preferred,"Everything except for its comfort level beats QC35ii. QC35 is still miles ahead in terms of comfort. The plasitcky feel of 700 - not a fan. Function-wise, awesome."
Bose,NC700,2,1,2020-02-06,Noise canceling feature was but really working the way I expected to,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I literally thought the noise canceling feature was going to work and then I was on the train or on the plane and I could hear everything around me so that was not a noise canceling feature at all that I paid 440, tax included for. I returned it."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-06,Crisp sound but lacks bass.,Sound quality was on point. High and lows were great no complaints. No distortion and comfortable. I do not recommend for the gym due to the material and ip rating. But it lacked one thing and that was bass. My music ranges Freddy Mercury to Kanye West. A mixture of everything. Vocals were great. But if you’re expecting that bass with the Bose 700. Unfortunate Sony or Beats would be a replacement. Overall futuristic design and I liked it but did not enjoy the fact that it wouldn’t fold.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-09,Love the headphones! Best gift,"Amazing headphones. Noise cancelling ranges from 0, 5 and 10. Even at 10 you can still hear the outside noise it’s not true noise canceling but once you put on a song the noise canceling becomes stronger. Definitely worth the mony."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-02-09,Noise cancellation does not work,I can hear almost everything even when I put on highest noise cancellation level.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-11,Great Sound!,I love my new headphones. I can ramp up the noise cancelling and you can't hear all the noise going on around me. Just what I wanted.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-11,"Bad app, good headphones","Android app compatibility doesn't work for me on a OnePlus 7 Pro, had to use a friend's phone to customize the noise cancellation. Other than that headphones are good. Got a battery of 17 hours with full noise cancellation. Not too much pressure on the ears and very comfortable. Noise cancellation is super effective and it's the classic Bose sound signature."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-12,Great Headphones,These are by far the best headphones I have ever had. Love the noise cancellation and the comfort. Gestures take some time to get used to but after you get that it is great!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-14,Out of this world,These are the best headphones I’ve ever used. The sound quality is out of this world and makes everything else sound cheap. Very happy with my purchase.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-14,Overall good,Overall good
Bose,NC700,5,0,2020-02-15,Absolutely phenomenal.,"The bose 700 series headphones are truly exceptional. The new design is beautiful and modern. The build quality is excellent and feels like it will last a long time as long as you don't abuse it. I use these headphones mainly on domestic and international flights. The moment you turn on the noise cancel feature, everything is silent. These aren't my first NC headphones, but they are the BEST I've used to date. I have quite a large head and they still fit very comfortably. The ear pads are perfect. I can fly on an international flight for 10+ hours and not have to worry about the battery. I personally don't use the Alexa feature, but I do use the headphones to make phone calls when I'm busy. The caller sounds perfect and can hear my voice perfectly too. Finally, the sound quality is amazing to me. I listen to everything from podcasts, audio books, EMD, Hip Hop, and more. Plenty of bass but not overwhelming. These headphones are amazing. You wont regret this purchase."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-15,Quality,Did what I expected it to do
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-02-17,Good but...could be better.,"I prefer the previous model, better bass, better noise cancellation. The only good point is the design, it is nice."
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-17,Crackling noise,Already starting to hear crackling.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-18,How have I done so much traveling in the past without these,"If you travel a lot for work like me, these are essential for your sanity. The only thing I'm upset about is why I hadn't bought these earlier. For phone calls, these things make it easier for you to hear, but also for the person who's talking to to hear you! The noise cancellation works both ways and there's no echo. Comfort gets 5/5 — they're not too heavy that my neck gets tired, I've worn them 6 hours straight without any condensation buildup/sweat in the earcups. I have a big head and these don't press on my skull the way other brands have in the past. Controls get 5/5 — the touch sensor works amazing (I just have to remember all the different swipes) but sometimes my fingers pause or turn off the headphones by accident, so you just have to be careful where you grab them. My hair doesn't get caught in the headpiece which is awesome. Sound gets 5/5 but the bass isn't super punchy, which i'm fine with. It also comes with a headphone jack for in-flight movies which is a thoughtful touch. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and it looks beautiful, too! (got the rose gold and white)"
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-02-18,AMAZON SAVED MY SANITY!!!,"My headphones arrived 3 days ago and I have experienced absolute frustration trying to set them up and, most notably, linking to Alexa! Then I received an email from Amazon with clear and concise instructions. Alexa and I were connected and conversing in less than 10 minutes. (I actually wept a little bit.) Thank you, Amazon, more than you will ever know!! !"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-02-26,Orchestrate Your World,They are living on my head.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-03,"Great headphones, but not quite noise cancelling.","While the sound quality of these are wonderful, they do not quite do the job in noise cancelling. I bought these to help me drown out the sound of snoring, however while they help, they do not cancel out the noise as I would had hoped. Overall, I like the headphones and will keep them, but a heads up to those that might be purchasing them for the same reason."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-05,Great but...,Very nice headphones but had to return as they were a little big for my head. Also a little trouble to connect. Too expensive for having less than 100% fit.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-06,Highly recommend!,My husband surprised me with the headphones as a gift. I really enjoy them. Great quality!
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-07,Worth the money!,Beautifully engineered. Comfortable. Easy Bluetooth connection. Easy adjustment of volume and song selection. High quality speakers.
Bose,NC700,3,1,2020-03-07,Great sound but uncomfortable.,Great sound quality but it hurts my ears pretty quickly.
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-07,Great sound but tough to connect,"The sound is excellent. My problem is that it often is NOT connecting to my phone or my laptop when I try to make or receive a call. My little PureGear earplug headset always connects perfectly. With the Bose I'm wondering why I don't hear anything, then I pull the headset off and put the actual phone to my ear and hear ""can you hear me? can you hear me now? like the old commercial. Since that's the main reason I bought the expensive Bose headset, I'm less than happy. I spent an hour on the phone with their service people who got it working - once. The next time the headset was turned off and back on again, I had to go to settings of both phone and laptop to get it to connect. Once. I didn't try again."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-08,Interstellar or in my head,Wow I don’t know what planet I go to when sound canceling is on 10
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-08,Love these!,"These are my first pair of headphones, so I am not an expert. I really enjoy using them for my daily workouts, the sound quality is amazing. It was easy to set up and the battery life is really great. I recommend this product."
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-09,Bad design,"I wanted to love these, but the only thing that actually works is the noise cancellation. When the headphones are fully charged the sound quality is just ok, but with continued used (30 minutes after a full charge) the quality gets crackled or like others have explained it kind of stutters. I had read that when this happens you need to unpair the headphones from everything they are connected to and then reconnect...this works but has to be done EVERY time they are charged! This has made me dread using them. Another problem with these is the app required to pair with your phone...it doesn’t work at all! I have not been able to pair with my phone once because of the poorly designed app that has no customer support. In my opinion these headphones and the app are a complete fail by Bose."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-10,They are a Little bit heavy,"They are great for the plane! They are a bit heavy ,otherwise a great product!"
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-10,Loved it,Very stylish and great sound quality
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-03-10,Excellent Tech Heavy Headband,"I really love the technology on these headphones. They are state of the art. Sound is amazing. However, the headband is quite heavy. I found that it becomes uncomfortable after an hour of wear. The soft part of the headband isn’t firm enough to with stand the heaviness."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-03-11,Use them daily...,"I work in an office were a majority of the people around me are on the phone most of the day. When I have my headphones on I can focus on my work and truly enjoy the music. The sound is incredible! Bose has an AR app where you can truly experience some amazing sound and movement to and form each ear....birds chirping etc. These weren't cheap by any means, but to me they were worth every penny!"
Bose,NC700,1,1,2020-03-21,Sounded Great but wouldnt work with my work softphone,"I looked at these at the Bose store when I was out of town and 300 miles from home. The guy at the counter said they would work with my softphone on my computer, unsure I drove home and thought about it investigated and spent $350.00 to only find out they didn't. I returned them with in my 30 days. I had them on for maybe 20 minutes to find out they weren't compatible and sent them back to get a refund of $279.00? it cost me $70.00 to use them for 20 minutes and return them within my 30 day window? great customer service!"
Bose,NC700,4,1,2020-04-10,Great noise cancellation.,I love these honestly. I really needed something to cancel noise. They work very well at noise cancellation and allow me to focus easily which is essential. I got a pair for my husband and myself. The only downside is that after wearing them for a while they can cause a headache. The fit is very comfortable as it has a nice cushion but even with that they still give me a tension headache.
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-15,Great headphones,"Bought these for my wife. She’s VERY picky about headphones, specifically about comfort. She had planned to do a lot of flying for work this year and the engine noise gives her a headache. She loves these, and even uses them to make work calls. The sound quality is great and noise cancelling is amazing. I have a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones which are 7 years old, and Bose has really progressed the technology a lot since. Highly recommend."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-21,Frightening fantastic,"Great headphones, but when I turn the volume down to the limit it makes a sound telling you that’s it’s the limit and it’s scared me like 10 times so expect that."
Bose,NC700,5,1,2020-04-29,Don’t hesitate buying it!,I absolutely love it! The best purchase I’ve ever made! All the descriptions about the item is perfectly accurate.
