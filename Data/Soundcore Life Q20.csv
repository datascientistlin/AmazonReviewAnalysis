Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-07-26,"Comfortable and ergonomic, great noise cancelling, sounds a little thin","I like these headphones. I did a side-by-side comparison with the beats solo and found a few key differences. The soundcore headphones are more comfortable and flexible than the beats. The ear cups are also large, which made me almost forget I was wearing them because they fit so nicely on my ear. The controls are plastic buttons, rather than the touch sensors on the beats - so they are not quite as sleek. Soundcore more than makes up for it in comfort though. The noise cancelling is also far superior to the beats. When I have these on, I cannot hear someone talking to me from 3 feet away, even when the volume is only at 50%. The only advantage that the beats have over the soundcore is depth of sound, the quality and crispness of music is definitely not as good in the soundcore as it is in competitors. If I did not have another set of headphones to compare it to, I probably wouldn't notice. Overall I would recommend these, especially for people wearing them for long durations or in especially noisy areas.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-07-27,Great sound with these headphones...,"These Bluetooth headphones are very comfortable & easy to set up. I can’t wear ear buds or anything that actually goes in the ear canal but the memory foam ear cups fit like a dream & effectively block outside noise. It’s also very easy to adjust the headband for a perfect fit. It was easy to pair with Bluetooth. I have an upcoming flight across country & I look forward to being in my own little world without listening to all the extra noise on the plane. A full charge gives 30-hours of wireless playtime & it has a notification tone when there are only 2 hours of playtime left. My trip is over 12 hours due to layovers & I don’t have to worry about my ear phones going dead. If there was any reason I didn’t have enough juice & no time for a full charge, 5 minutes gives a quick charge for 4 hours of listening. It has Hi-Res Audio for a great sound. I like strong bass in my music & by double pressing the play button it instantly strengthens the bass output. The headphones have a travel bag that has a pocket with a velcro closure to hold the AUX cable & & micro USB cable. The manual is easy to read & understand. I think the hardest thing for me was seeing the markings on the tiny controls on each earpiece. I haven’t taken any calls, as I’m not accustomed to the buttons, yet. Once I get used to them it’ll come naturally. These are really great headphones, probably the best I’ve seen in quite a while.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-07-28,VERY good noise cancellation,"The Q20 headphones are some of the better noise cancelling headphones on the market. I've tried several brands and found that the four-microphone setup they use rivals the cancellation capability of my noise cancelling aviation headset which cost as much as a decent used car. That's pretty impressive. The design is comfortable, with the ear cups able to articulate in any direction necessary for a good fit. These might not do well with small people, however- I've got the headband adjusted to the smallest setting and I'm not even a small person. These would likely feel loose on a youngster's head. Sound quality. Therein lies my only criticism. The extra bass circuit is interesting and the overall sound is quite good. There is a noticeable lack of high end, it's just not a crisp sound. MANY headphones are this way, likely to help reduce listening fatigue. Imaging is nowhere near what some headphones are capable of, but those headphones (in my experience) don't have as competent of a noise cancelling capability. I'd rather have the Soundcore headphones on a long airplane trip because of that. I have not tried the microphone and cell phone capability because I use headphones exclusively for music. Overall, I'd give these a thumbs-up as they are a good compromise between sound quality and noise cancellation.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Cushy/soft and large enough to not cramp you ears. The next bit of awesome is the noise cancellation; this is tops for killing ambient noise, (love these on a flight). If the volume is set at a reasonable level you'll still be able to hear when someone is talking to you though. These aren't as great for sound as B&W PX or even something like Beats. The PX really are superb for music; they really add depth to any track I've ever listened to...there's just so much I didn't know I was missing. The Beats, too, are a bit better than these for sound quality.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-07-31,Nice at the high end,"When I first put on the Soundcore headphones I had pretty low expectations as I had never heard of the brand, and this is a family which is pretty serious about audio. That said, I was expecting something pretty generic and was pleasantly surprised. The first piece I listened to was acoustic guitar, and the clarity was beautiful. There was no background noise and I could hear the guitar strings clearly. That does not happen often, at least with low end or mid-range headphones. When I test headphones I put them through a broad range of music and listen for a couple of hours as many will improve with burn in. My experience with these was different. I liked them less as I listened longer. I did not notice a significant improvement with burn in, or in fact, much of a change when I used the bass boost button. Now I am not a fan of boosted bass. For one, I prefer a more natural balanced sound. I have also found that on most boosted bass equipment (speakers and headphones) something is lost, sacrificed. The high end and mids are usually lost or just not handled well. A couple of months ago I tried a set in which this was not the case, Sony's mid range boosted bass headphones, where the equalization shift was evident but the highs and mids were lower without having a reduced sound quality. I have tried a lot of headphones this year and purchased several sets. It seems to be the year that bluetooth was really figured out. There are a number of good sets out there and this is not among the best, even in the price range. It is good, better than average, but not as good as any of the Sony's, or Sennheisers. The highs on these are better than most, but the bass is not as good, even with bass boost on. They have nice clarity but do not touch the Sony WH1000s. There is not much of a sound stage. They sounded better with a solo guitar than with a band or orchestra. Stereo and localization is not as good as with a lot of other headphones, and good stereo is something I consider important in audio. That said, these would not work especially well as a gaming set (but they are not presented as such) but they also lack some as audio phones without good separation. My review may be a bit technical for some, but I know that there are a lot of people who do a fair bit of research before they purchase. I am one. The noise cancellation is good, and I do not believe it interferes with the sound (it does on some). I am not sure it is the best. Sony's nopise cancellation is startling. When I tried them we had a thundesrstorm which I was completely unaware of until I took them off and went outside. The noise cancellation on the Soundcore is good but I am not sure it is as good. It may be. I did not have that level of background noise when I tried these so I can not really be sure. They headband is light and pretty comfortable. It does not clamp tightly like some I have tried, did not give me a headache even after wearing them for hours, but I would not call them cushy (like Sennheisers). They are huge! I had to wear them on the smallest setting. These would not work for teens or kids, or even petite adults. The ear cups are padded, and comfortable but the synthetic leather builds up heat pretty quickly. Even wearing them in the evening, in air conditioning, I had to take them off to cool down. That is, I was getting so hot that it was really uncomfortable. I live in Hawaii, and so it is more of an issue here than most places, but it is worth knowing that the material does not breathe and that there is heat build up. They are articulated and fold well which adds to the comfort and fit, and also makes them very mobile. I have given these to my daughter to try because she listens to a different range of music than I do. I may adjust my rating dafter she has tried them. She likes a lot of bass, so I do not expect her to like these better than I did, but I could be wrong. The literature says they use an algorithm to adjust bass and it is possible that it will work better with the music she listens to than what I listen to. In sum, I think these are pretty good mid-range phones. The high end has very nice clarity but the bass is somewhat lacking. I did not find the sound as rich as my Sennheisers, or as precise as my Sony's. The headset is light, adjustable, comfortable. They fold and would be good as a mobile headset. The noise cancellation is good, and I can see wearing these on a city street. All in all I think these are significantly better than average, but not my personal favorites.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-01,Great sound. Hit or miss on voice.,"I've been using his Beo H7's as, my last pair of headsets, have finally gone kaput. While I like the sound & voice quality on the H7, don't like how firm the ear pieces are. Very dense, almost rock-like foam. If you lie down, they dig. Also, not a fan of Beo's ANC. It had what I call, ""Succulating"". Sucks the noise out so hard, you're in a vacuum vortex of isolating. Some may like this, I find it makes me feel off balance. So those are the 3 major features where Anker's Q20 excels. - sound quality incredible - pillow soft ear foam - noise cancelling quiets while still letting in removed outside noise. From a safety issue, I prefer to still be aware of noises around me, just don't want them invading my happy place. Challenges of the Q20 - phone quality always clear on my end but listeners complained of static in a variety of situations - the headphones slip, and sometimes fall off, with excessive motion, ie Blink182. - won't pair to soundbar. Only pairs to app related audio where you can click the Q20. All in all, if the current price point really remains at$59, these are a steal. I would pay double that just on the exceptional sound quality & comfort. Perhaps pick up an Aftermarket headband for fit.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Not only do they have clear sound, but they are comfortable for longer listening times. They make listening to something easy even when the train in the valley is going by, or the trash trucks are at work. I don't usually use the noise cancellation since the headphones cancel a lot of noise anyway, but turning on the noise cancellation was astonishing! It cut out so much noise that I didn't know when the AC kicked on and wondered why I suddenly felt my chair vibrate just a little. I can completely understand why there are cautions about using the noise cancellation at times because you really can't hear much! I charged my headphones one week, and it is still fully charged a week later. Of course I don't listen all the time or for hours on end, but it's great that I don't have to charge them all the time. One thing I really like about these, besides the comfort and noise blocking, is the fact that they are wireless. I like to be able to get up and move away from my computer and still keep listening.

I had an easy time syncing them to my phone. The travel case is a nice extra. And it’s really easy to fold them up and take them with you.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-08,Good price/value ratio. Very comfy. Wish it came with hard case.,"I have uploaded photos of the directions. Took about 3 to 3.5 hours to fully charge with a 5V power output brick over 5 trials. Stated charge time is 3 hours, so this is close. Uses micro USB to charge. They weigh about 260g or about 9.2 ounces without the cord. The bluetooth works about 25 to 30 feet direct line of sight away from my phone. This is pretty typical. It is Bluetooth V 5.0 The battery lasted between 19-23 hours when using bluetooth AND noise cancelling at the same time over 3 trials at a fairly high volume. (These are approximate, I check them every hour or so to see if still running) Bluetooth connecting is easy. The sound is good for listening to pretty much everything, general music, podcasts, videos. I used these to listen to opera with very subtle sound of a glass harmonica and they worked well. Some audiophiles say headphones work better after a burn in of 50 hours, so I left them playing that long while testing the battery endurance. I did not notice a difference. Then again I am not an audiophile. The claimed range of 16 to 22,000 Hz covers more than the normal range of human hearing. 20-20000hz Sensitivity (as in manual) is the range of perfect human hearing. I am old enough that I do not hear above 17,000 Hz, but I can vouch they do go that high (tested them on an online sound generator). Worked well on a plane flight to get rid of the constant monotonous hum of engine noise. These are one of the most comfortable headsets I have had. They work fine on a large head. They fit around even largish ears and stay on without pressing hard on your head. These would be four star headphones except that they are really a good value for the price, which bumps them to 5 stars. I would have liked a hard case, the bag does take up less space but does not provide the protection I like when traveling.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

There is a small book, and I emphasize book, to go along with these headphones, features, directions, trouble shooting, etcetera.

I got 30 hours of playtime before I had to charge. I like that if need be I can convert these headphones to plug in headphones. The voice is the least annoying of my Bluetooth headphones. The sound is decent for music. The noise cancelling is not like sound deprivation but it feels like you are very far away from surrounding noise. The muff portions actually fit my little ears so well they are inside the muff cups. There are buttons on both sides of the earphones, which can make it easier to navigate if you remember where they are. Things that are not amazing for me, the muff style headphones tend to make voices muffled, like audiobooks and podcasts. There is too much bass or something and the spoken word is harder to hear.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-21,Not up to the same level as other Anker products,"Much as I like and use a lot of Anker products, these don't make the cut, and sadly for a lot of aesthetic and clunky design reasons that don't have much to do with their intended functionality. At their core, they provide good ANC, and pleasant - if a tad bassy - sound quality. That said, I'll outline the pros and cons I've observed in using them on the first day: pros: - as noted, nice sound quality, with some reinforcement in the mid-bass frequencies, but the bass is tight, and the mids and highs are mellow - almost inaudible difference to sound quality with noise cancellation enabled, and no notable hiss with ANC on - ANC is not 'make the world go away' levels, and lets some higher frequency sound through; this is great, as I am looking to cancel out midrange and bass sounds like an air conditioner, nearby dogs, and the wearing rumble of airplane engines during long flights - aside from the slightly too small earcups (for my tastes), they are comfortable to wear - neither too loose nor too tight - the various audible and voice prompts are pleasant and at a reasonable volume cons: - big problem: can't charge and listen at the same time - big problem: no ability to use as a phone headset in wired mode (these are headphones only when used with the cable, with no mic available) - the earcup material is too insulative, resulting in unpleasant warmth and sweating under fairly normal circumstances (74F / 45% RH, just sitting at computer doing work, so these would suck for truly warm, humid, and and/or strenuous activity) - when switching ANC on and off, the enhanced bass enables momentarily, which is just sloppy design, and rather jarring - they have stiff creaky hinges and pivots, which is emblematic of inexpensive plastic-on-plastic construction - they have a light but unpleasant chemical smell, which I suspect is from the earcup material, and it's not dissipating any too quickly - a general lack of build refinement - they're nice enough, but the point where the earcup cushions meet the body was wrinkled and unevenly finished All this said, I can't really recommend these, since I think refinement and solid build quality should be reasonable expectations at a $70 price point. If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would, but since their core functionality is great, I'll go with 4 stars instead of 3.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-08-21,Anker soundcore life Q20,"The Anker Soundcore Life Q20 bluetooth headphones are not what I had expected from a $60 pair of headphones. The sound, the weight, the build quality, and the style are all something to appreciate from this pair of headphones. If you are looking for an expensive sounding pair of headphones for a small price look no further. I will go over all of the specs of the headphones in detail below. General Specs Lets start with what these headphones have to offer. The first item to note about these headphones is that they have bluetooth 5.0. This means their range is ridiculously far and they are low energy data transfer headphones. This is how this pair of headphones packs a 30 hour battery life with all the extras turned on. You can get up to 60 hours if you have a couple features turned off and don't need the volume very loud. They offer noise cancelation and a bass boost function. The padding around your ear is memory foam and my favorite part is that it actually goes around your ear and does not sit on it. They are light and have great sound. The bass is the most impressive part of these headphones. People that do not want bass may want to stay clear of these, but from my testing I really enjoyed the sound. They came with an auxilary cable, charging cable, and a carry pouch. Sound Lets talk about the sound features. The normal sound out of the box is great. if you are bass heavy and want more, they have a bass up feature that really hits. They offer noise canceling to drown out background noises. With bass up and noise canceling on, this is where you get up to 30 hours of battery life. If you don't use these features you can get yourself up to 60 hours of battery. I personally have not needed the noise canceling feature yet and I feel like the sound in normal mode is great. I have easily gotten 40 hours out of these headphones. Louder volumes will affect the battery life as well. If you are an audiofile you may have different opinions than me, but I think these sound as good as Beats or other $100 plus headphones. Build Quality These headphones are light and of course they adjust for different head sizes. They don't feel cheap, which I like. The memory foam cushion around the ears is comfortable. The thing I like the most is the fact that they are big enough to go around my ears instead of sitting on my ears like other headphones do. These are very comfortable well built headphones. Conclusion The Anker Soundcore Life Q20 are a great pair of headphones. In my personal opinion they provide the sound a more expensive option would provide. They are comfortable and have great battery life. I would suggest this pair of headphones to anyone looking for an affordable but expensive sounding pair of headphones.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I compared these to my friends Bose QC 35 noise cancelling headphones and these work better! The sounds quality at high volumes could be a little cleaner, but it works great for what I need. These are great for mowing the lawn and blocking the lawnmower noise from my zero turn. My other set of over the ear Anker headphones (Soundcore Vortex) need to be at basically full volume to hear the music while mowing. These do not need to be thanks to the hybrid active noise cancellation. I also really like the folding design of these. I wish they came with a better case though as I plan on taking them to Europe. A hard case would be better for a carry on plane ride to protect them. That is really my only big complaint. The bass up feature is neat and works pretty well if you are into that. The battery life is amazing on these as well. I have had them for a week with daily usage and no charges yet! Overall I am very satisfied with the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 headphones.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-24,Excellent Value For Everyday Use,"Pros: Packaging is done very well. The product is well protected. The package contains all necessary accessories. The design is clean and functional. No unnecessary style elements. The ear cups are comfortable for long time use. Headband is robust and easily adjustable. Speaker enclosures rotate 90 degrees for storage. Sound quality is quite good and works in noisy environments. Cons: Noise reduction is adequate for the price point, but does not blank out all ambient noise. Instruction booklet is very basic. No operating detail is provided. However many languages are presented for world-wide acceptance. Pairing with Bluetooth was initially confusing, but subsequently simple and fast. Instructions were not clear. My overall opinion of the Soundcore Life Q20 is very positive. I have had other Bluetooth headsets in the past and have had quality difficulties. Having tested the Soundcore Life Q20 for a month of almost daily usage, I have found them to be reliable, easy to use with good sound reproduction quality and well made. Of particular favorable note, the ear cups are securely attached to the speaker units. With other brands in this price range I have had occasions where the foam ear cups simple fall off, especially when the headset is packed in a backpack or carry bag. These foam ear caps stayed in place. The speaker units swivel 90 degrees to lie flat for packing. The recharging time is normal and recharge recovery is quick. It is to be noted that the interior of the ear cups are market L and R, Left and Right, for orientation. A nice little feature for first time users. Construction is all plastic, except for a portion of the easily expanded top headband. That portion appears to be stainless steel. Headphone controls are found on the bottom of each ear cup. The Left cup has the ON/OFF button as well the NC button which enables noise reduction. The Right ear cup has a Play button in the center with a + to advance to the next track and a - to go back, These are easily manipulated by touch. The headphones appear to be able to withstand normal handling and travel jostling, but i would not let them be used as a toy by young children. Within this price range, the Soundcore Life Q20 is a good choice.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I've used the Soundcore Life Q20's for about a week now. Overall, they are a great value for the price. My initial impression was very good. The packaging and presentation is on par with what I have come to expect from anker products. They came with and audio cable for wired input, and a micro USB cable for charging. They fold flat for storage, as seen in the packaged photo, and have a cloth carry bag. The headphones are light, which means they are comfortable to wear for extended sessions, but does not contribute to the impression of quality. The volume, power, and active noise canceling buttons are intuitive to use and function well, but also feel flimsy. Sound quality is OK, but sounds muddy. They have a bass boost feature, but still lack deep bass. The highs lack crispness and clarity. Overall they aren't perfect, but they do a decent job of everything at a relatively budget friendly price.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-08-24,Not Very Loud,"The sound quality on these speakers is really good, but they don't get very loud. Generally, when I'm listening to music, I want headphones whee I can turn up the volume as much as I can tolerate. With these, I could have the volume up max, and it still wasn't very loud. I don't always like to listen to my music loud either. It's just that these don't get all that loud. The quality of that sound was amazing though. I think these would be better suited for kids, that way they aren't listening to music too loud. The noise cancellation was pretty neat. I had never experienced it before, but when you're in a car and turn these on, it kind of makes it calm and peaceful inside. It's such a neat little feature. I think I like these headphones more for the noise cancellation than I do for listening to music. The price isn't horrible, but considering these don't go as loud as I would like, it's not something I would go out of my way to buy.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-26,Good value for the price,"Pros: great battery life, low price Cons: noise cancellation is decent but not great, ear cups trap heat I fly a few times a year and commute ok public transit most days. I have a nice pair of IEMs that I use for long haul flights but prefer wireless headphones for my regular commute. These headphones do a decent job reducing train & ambient noise but you can still hear the outside world (it's a good amount quieter, but definitely still there). Another minor issue with these - when I wear these headphones for more than 2 hours at a time, my ears get a little sweaty. This isn't a problem on airplanes (because it tends to be so cold) but out and about I did notice it. On flights my in ear monitors do a better job blocking out the engine noise and are much better at blocking out voices (especially crying infants, which the soundcore Q20 isn't great at blocking). Still, the Q20 is good enough that it's going to replace my expensive IEMs on shorter flights. Battery life is probably the strongest argument in favor of the Q20 - I've been using them for my daily commute + a roundtrip flight over the last 2 weeks and still am going off the initial charge. I've never owned wireless headphones with such good battery life. Overall given the $50-60 price point, sound quality is slightly better than I expected, noise cancelling is decent but not great, and battery life has really impressed me. If you're looking for quiet on long flights this probably isn't your best bet, but for daily use and the occasional <4 hour flight, these are great.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-08-28,"Life Q20 Review: Good ANC, Average Bass, and Basic Flaws.","I ordered the Life Q20's mainly for the ANC. I didn't want to spend 300 dollars for a pair of Bose, or even 350 for the new 700s, so I knew there would be sacrifices at this price point. It was really between these and the Mpow H12's with Hybrid Noice Cancellation, which are also 60 dollars (but on sale for 40 right now). Really the only reason I picked these was because they work with Google Assistant, look slightly nicer, and because I know Anker's earpads are really comfortable, but didn't know how the Mpow's felt. FEEL: That said, these are really comfortable headphones. I used to own a pair of the Crusher Wireless's from Skullcandy and these are wayyy more comfortable. The memory foam is superb and the headband doesn't crush at all. The biggest issue with the cuffs is they get hot. Now I do sweat more than an average person but these get a little too hot. If I'm walking it's not to the point where I'll sweat, but it gets near that tipping point. ANC: The ANC on these isn't bad. It obviously doesn't compare to Bose's ANC, but honestly, when you're already listening to music, you can't really hear much. I play football and there's a huge speaker in the room where the team plays music. If I turn on the ANC and turn the volume up, I really can't hear it that well, if at all. I can't say how they perform on flights, as I'm not going to be on one any time soon, but if I do fly I will update for sure. FLAW (ANC): One big complaint (and, unless returning wasn't a hassle, would be a deal breaker for me), is that there is an issue with wind. When it's windy outside and the ANC is on, the Mics will pick up the sound of the wind and try to counter it, which makes a windy noise on the inside. It's not extremely loud but it's loud enough to notice, and it's also simply not acceptable from a company like Anker, at a price point of 60 dollars. It's not a big gripe but it's one that simply shouldn't exist for a pair of headphones at this price point. SOUND QUALITY: I'm not really an audiophile, and I do like bass so I am slightly biased, but these aren't bad. The soundstage is lacking, and the bass is heavily lacking in the bass up feature (honestly it just seems to muddle the treble and mids). It's good for anybody who just listens to music for chilling and fun. If you're an audiophile I'm sure there are issues with it. FLAW (SOUND QUALITY): One huge flaw with these headphones is how they sound wired! Goodness it's incredible how they go from $60-$100 sounding headphones straight down to $15-$20 headphones. You HAVE to turn ANC on in order for the headphones to sound how they would with Bluetooth on. Without the ANC (and a charge for it) they sound awful, which is a major flaw because the whole point of a cable is to use it without draining the battery... All of that in perspective, I would probably recommend the Mpow H12's over these. Those have incredible reviews and I haven't seen anything about the wind issue (which again, is basically a deal breaker. It definitely would have been if I'd known beforehand). The only issue is those don't have any support for Google Assistant or Siri or Alexa.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Bought different items (chargers, powerbank, speakers, headphones..) from this Brand. Satisfied with most of purchases. This is a new production after Life 2. It looks same as life 2, but added Hybrid Active Noise Canceling which you will find on ""SoundCore Space NC"". I don't have either Life 2 or Space NC to compare the noise cancellation performance. But I have tried Bose Q35II and Sony WH1000XM3 in the store. I mainly use this headphone in the office to block the sounds from other people's discussion or conference calls. For this purpose, this headphone doesn't meet my expectation. Although it mostly eliminates all the background noises (like fan, air conditioner,...) but I still can hear my colleague's voice with ANC on. This is my personal opinion, based on my use case. Other reviewers seem to like it, because they want to be aware when someone talk with them. It all depends on your situation. Other than the ANC could be better, nothing else can be complained, especially at this price point. Just like other Anker products, the build quality is great.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-09-05,Exceptional for the price,"I own a pair of Bose QC 25 headphones which I enjoy thoroughly. They are my go to headphones in almost every situation whether studying at home or on a plane. This noise cancellation with the Bose QC 25 is good, but not as good as the QC 35. However, the sound quality of Bose is fantastic in my opinion and I have several additional pair of Bose headphones that I use at the gym and as a back up pair. I've even converted my wife to Bose quality. That being said, i needed a pair of headphones to use at work to drown out the noise while working at the computer and I didn't want to take the risk of my Bose being damaged or growing legs and walking away. Unfortunately I have very high quality standards but a limited budget, so I tried to find something that would meet my needs while not breaking the bank. Enter the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 headphones. Bought from Amazon at around the $50 mark, I figured that the Anker quality would make them durable, but I wasn't convinced that the sound quality and noise cancellation would even compare to my Bose. I can wholeheartedly say that I was wrong. The build is actually better than my Bose. Very solid and yet modernly styled and not bulky. While the sound is not Bose by any means, it is exceptional for this price point. Not a big fan of the bass boost as it makes the totality of the music more subdued and somewhat detracts from the overall quality. Without the bass boost, I found that the sound quality is well rounded and has enough punch so that it doesn't feel lacking at any range. The noise cancellation is quite good, but doesn't rival the QC 35, which to me is the standard for higher end headphones. With just the noise cancellation on it does make a noticeable difference in quieting conversations in the office around me, but still allows overly loud conversations to seep through. With noise cancellation and music together, the noises fade away and are almost undetectable. The included carry bag is decent quality, but seems a little small for the headphones and cords as the headphones seem to slightly stick out of the top of the bag. With the draw string pulled together, it tucks the headphones away in the bag but has a tendency to compress the ear cups, which I believe over time may limit their life span, resulting in a need for replacement. Overall, while not $300 headphones, they are surprisingly robust in almost every facet and make a great choice for those on a budget who wish to enjoy some of the benefits of the higher priced headphones while not breaking the bank.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-09-06,Audiophile Review (sort of),"Full disclosure, I'm not exactly a full-blown audiophile. However, I couldn't seem to find anything resembling a more audio-quality focused review for these on head-fi and other sites, so I figured I'd do a brief(ish) sound overview. Going into this I wasn't expecting much, and to be honest, I didn't get much. But I'll try to convince you why that's okay, and these are still a pretty good buy, imo. The following is for the ""normal"" EQ mode, which in reality isn't all that normal whatsoever. Tests were done using lossless FLAC files through a mid-range DAC. Whether or not you believe in burn-in, I did let them play for a little while before doing any testing. Starting at the low end, it's a bassy mess. Sub-bass is actually alright, maybe slightly overtuned. Mid-bass becomes a terribly bloated, muddy monstrosity and to add insult to injury, it's boosted to appalling amounts. Very unpleasant. Lower mid to midrange follows similarly and sounds slightly closed. Moderate to severe congestion issues with bass, and it even bleeds a bit into higher mids and presence range as well. As a result, vocals are less than desirable. Everything sounds relatively laid-back even at high volume. Also, there's an AWFUL sibilance somewhere around 2k-3kHz, leading some hi-hats to sound almost like white noise. The highs beyond that are just decent. They can get a little glassy and bright but they hold up nicely otherwise. Overall, these headphones have a complete disregard for balance (which I expected) and hold a very typical V shaped signature. Clarity is barely passable, and soundstage is unimpressive. After a bit of EQ, they do sound better, but of course, that is up to the user. No type of aptX seems to be supported. Audio performance is slightly (yet noticeably) better wired, but Bluetooth connectivity is great and hissing is kept to an impressive minimum. The bass boost function is there, but why anyone would choose to use it is beyond me. The ANC is alright; it doesn't do the sound quality any favors. So far the review been pretty negative, but keep in mind the price and intended purpose. For a pair of $60 Bluetooth cans from a company that's basically still a baby in the audio industry, these are honestly not bad. What they lack in sound they make up for in build quality, comfort, and ease of use. I bought these to use on the subway, walking down the street, etc. and they perform very well in those environments. They were never meant to be studio monitors. The ear cushions are very soft and offer many hours of listening before getting uncomfortable/hot. Media and volume controls are tactile and easy to use. Construction is solid - creaking/microphonics at the hinges are not present when moving around. If you're using these outside or near other people, chances are that the surrounding environmental noise will cover up the sub-stellar audio quality anyways, even with the ANC on. At the end of the day, I'd still recommend these for anyone who wants a comfortable and convenient pair of wireless headphones. They feel very nice, and even smell kind of nice right out of the box.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I’ve been listening to audiobooks via the Audible app for a couple of years, and before I got these headphones, I would just turn up the volume on my iPhone while I cleaned. This was a decent solution, but it didn’t always help to hold my concentration and/or it was difficult to hear over the vacuum or when I was washing the dishes. Likewise, when I was working on writing, I was easily distracted if my girls started to get raucous. But no more! Now I slap my headphones on, and I can clean for a long time before I get distracted, and my writing is also more productive because I can block out all the background noise. Earbuds start to bother my ears after awhile, so I really do appreciate the over the ear style. The ear cups are so soft; they’re comfortable to wear, and it’s easy to forget that I’m even wearing them. They really do block out all the noise, and the sound quality is great. I’ve paired these headphones with my iPhone and with my MacBook with no difficulties. They pair almost instantly whenever I want them to- I never have to fiddle with the settings like I do with some of our other Bluetooth products. The battery lasts for a long time. I end up charging these every couple of days; the headphones will tell me the battery life by saying “Battery high/medium/low” when I turn them on. When I do charge them, it’s a fairly quick process, so I’m waiting around forever- which is ideal. I would absolutely recommend the Soundcore headphones. I’ve become much more productive since getting them; having a short attention span is very frustrating, so finding a solution that increases productivity has changed my life for the better.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I've not been able to find the exact cause but it has happened only when noise cancellation is on.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-09-14,Great budget Noise Cancellation,"The Q20 headphones are easy to use, have good audio quality, are decently comfortable and have great battery life. The only codec that seems to work is SBC (presumably AAC works on iOS), although this information is not detailed in any documentation with the headphones or on their website. I use these with a portable audio player, not a phone, so I don't know how the microphones for voice calling work. I can say that the noise cancellation is very good for the price. It doesn't cut out as much high-frequency (mostly voice) noise as some other models, but it deletes a majority of the low-frequency and middle-frequency noise that is common on streets or airplanes. Noise cancellation is easy to toggle on and off, but takes a second holding the button so you're not likely to toggle it accidentally. The power button similarly takes a second or two to toggle. Bluetooth pairing is done via that power button as well, by holding it for a few seconds longer when turning the headphones on. The extra bass mode is decent, if you're into that sort of thing. I generally use the volume and play/pause buttons and little else, but I tested it and it works. For noise cancelling headphones that you won't worry about pampering, there aren't a lot of options out there. I think the Cowin models are the main competition. The Anker has slightly better noise cancellation, slightly better battery life, and that bass boost mode, but no AptX or other high-bitrate Bluetooth codec. Depending on what's important to you, the two are very similar. The Anker model folds flatter, but the Cowin comes with a more durable travel case.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-09-17,Great value!,"For context of this review, I also own the Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds and use them pretty regularly. First, the negative out of the way - they feel like cheap plastic to me. If you're playing with the buttons while they're on your ears you can hear how thin the manufacturing is in places. Kinda distracting, but you get used to it fast. Second negative is that they sit a little tight on the ears for a closed design, which also takes some getting used to. The positive - I have loud coworkers, and I sit pretty close to them. When I needed to concentrate previously, I'd grab my earbuds and crank music as loud as I could take it to drown them out. That mostly worked just fine, but I was probably doing some damage to my ears in the process. These headphones completely changed the game for me. Even with the ANC turned off, they still isolate pretty well. Once you turn on ANC, everything fads into the background and nothing cuts through. Not even my super aggressive typing, which I'm pretty sure also annoys my neighbors. :) Sound quality is solid. Not the BEST I've ever heard, but really solid. If you're listening over bluetooth, you have some compression artifacts already so complaining isn't allowed. Sure, they're not like 500 dollar studio monitor headsets on a nice amp, but for 50 bucks they're great. A little bass heavy maybe, but solid mid ranges too. Things I didn't test: Microphone / voice calls Battery life (it's long. I just charge it daily when I leave the office and I don't think I'm gonna run out of juice.)

My conclusion is that there is nothing close to the price/performance that you get with the Anker Q20. The noise cancellation on the Q20 is easily the best of the headphones I'm comparing, and much, much better than the the Backbeat Pro 2, which costs more than double the Q20. The sound quality is quite similar to the Anker Life 2, while the noise cancellation is similar to the Anker Space NC--the Q20 is really the best of both of Anker's previous attempts. Of all the headphones I'm comparing, I like the control ergonomics, overall comfort, and sound quality of the Backbeat Pro 2 the most, and the fact that the Backbeat Pro 2 will auto play/pause when you remove the headphones from your head is a really cool feature. Furthermore, the Backbeat pro is the coolest on my ears of any of the headphones I'm comparing. However, when purchasing these headphones, my primary goal was to have decent noise cancelling, and these fit the bill while still providing good overall sound quality, albeit a bit more bass heavy and less transparent sounding than the Backbeat Pro 2, which was definitely my favorite of the bunch as far as sound quality goes. Regardless, in the sub $100 price range, nothing seems to come close to the overall value of these. They have excellent battery life, noise cancelling that seems to be better than anything else in the sub $200 range, comfortable build, and fantastic sound quality for their price segment. The only area where they seem to fall short is breathability--they do feel fairly hot on the ears after awhile, especially compared to the Backbeat Pro 2 or the MPow h5. Having said that, breathability is the ONLY area where I find the MPow h5 to be superior to the Anker Q20.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

That said, I have yet to come across a better deal than this for my purposes for the below $100 price range. Expectations were low to begin with—as it is unfair to compare these to a product such as the Bose QuietComfort series—but were definitely exceeded! For this price, you really do get a lot for your money (customer service, build quality, materials, sound quality, battery life, many features, and even nicer packaging than this product probably deserves). Again, when judging it as a product in this price range, it's tough to really ""complain"" about anything. A few specific points: - Bluetooth 5: Have had no connectivity issues. - ANC: It does the job. Is it perfect? No. But it is a big help getting those ambient noises at a significantly lower volume. Has made listening music at work a much better experience. - Comfortable: Ear cushions are very soft. I'm also able to wear glasses with these, if needed, vs. my Audio-Technica ATH-M20x, which is impossible. - Sound: Sound quality is good and much better than I expected. Whereas I prefer a more neutral EQ, these are a slight bit mid/bass leaning, even more so with ANC enabled. That said, I don't use the BassUp feature, as it makes the listening experience too muddy for me. Would like an option to disable the voice prompts when enabling/disabling features, but that's more a personal preference. - Phone Calls: Glad I can go from listening to music to a phone call without having to remove the headphones. It just works. Enough said. - Convenience: Many on-board buttons make using these headphones an even better experience, eliminating the need to always refer back to my device. The battery life is also very generous. I debated for a while whether to purchase these or save for the Bose QuietComfort and am very happy I went with these and saved a lot of money. For my simple needs, these do an exceptional job!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

They have wonderful features (for a budget headphone) like the more expensive models. They tell you how much battery life you have left when you turn them on, they tell you when you turn on/off noise cancelling and they tell you when you turn on the bass feature. The ear cups are very spacious, super soft and comfortable. They also have the L & R in them for left and right. I wished I could have kept them! However, why I marked them down. I did find at the beginning they were a little muddied with the sound quality. That did seem to clear up after a few hours of use. They have a higher natural tone much like the Bose (but definitely different quality) but they have a bass you can add if you like even more bass! Maybe it is my skin sensitivity but from the moment I put these on my left ear I felt a slight tingling/burning sensation. I kept using them. The next day my ear was so red and swollen it was awful. Itchy hurting red! It stayed that way for a week. I cleaned these headphones and tried them again only for limited times. Several times. Same thing, it started to bother my ear and face on the left side. Then I put my hair over my ear as a barrier, but same thing. I read somewhere in these reviews where these headphones were warm and people’s ears were sweating so I think this must be it. There is just isn’t enough ventilation as my ears did feel warm! The only other complaint I could find is, they could be louder. I hit the max level a coupe of times watching tv. But other than those 2 things I just loved these headphones. I tried the Tao Tronics and they are more like the Sony’s with a natural deeper bass sound and they were louder but their ear cups were to small and didn’t have these high end features this headphone has like knowing how much battery life you have left. I also tried the Bose 700’s but that is a different price group and they have an issue with an auto off if your head doesn't move for 10 minutes that they can’t seem to fix.

The weird thing about the NC, is it does a great job of removing background hums (like airplane engine noise), but leaves all of the other random noises (people talking, glasses clanging, doors closing). It’s almost more like a hearing aid instead of canceling noise. If that is what you want out of headphones, then maybe they are for you, but for flying, they are worthless.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-10-08,Solid value at this pricepoint,"I was looking to replace my broken Bose QuietComfort 20's with something I could use at the office to drown out noise while providing a good listening experience. Was happy to find an Anker product that met those requirements for a price that seemed very reasonable. Pros: - Pleased with the sound quality. I'm not an audiophile, but these are great for my 'general listening' needs - No noticeable ""hiss"" when noise cancelling is on. - Noise cancelling is great, especially when ambient noise isn't too loud. They're great for my office. - Even using the noise cancelling, these carry a charge that is good enough for a few days of use, in my case. Really pleased with that. Cons - After wearing for about an hour+ straight of wearing these I usually have to take them off to give my head a rest -- over ears just feel restrictive to me. This is true of most headphones, so not blaming the product for this. - I'm a little disappointed in the build of these. Anker's stuff is usually so solid that I didn't expect creaky joints. I may have been expecting too much for this pricepoint. Overall, I'd say for $60 you can't go wrong.

My usage for Q20: travel on airplanes, at home for music or tv via streaming device. The SoundCore Q20 are solidly built and comfortable. Sound quality is good and there's a bass boost button. Not as good as an equalizer app like JayBird but that's a cost trade-off. In listening to a variety of music I did not feel the Q20s made my listening experience bad. True, they don't have the articulation of Bose where you can hear every plink of an instrument, but overall the sound experience is good, satisfying and full. NC is okay: they will lower the noise of a dishwasher, for example, to a mild hum instead of an annoyance. There's no case, just a rubbery bag which has an unpleasant odor, so plan on an extra $13 for a case which is fine because you can choose your preferred configuration of folded or flat layout.

If you absolutely must have superior noise cancelling, get the Sony headset. If good enough is good enough, or if you prioritize comfort, save $250 and buy these.

I've owned other noise canceling headphones, even cheap ones, and never experienced any of these problems. In addition, there's no way to activate the noise canceling without turning on the bluetooth feature of the headphones, leading to a shorter battery life for noise cancelling if you're like me and don't use bluetooth all the time.

I always look for their product to compare and try. They have perfect customer service and everything. But this headphone disappointed me so bad. The only reason i got this cause it is hybrid active nc headphone. But it makes that white noise. It is so annoying. When you don’t listen anything it makes that white noise and some short signals that i can hear. I was planning to use it in my very long flight to sleep and rest. But it is not possible. For the price it is a fair active noise cancellation. But it is not hybrid, it should be feedforward active noise cancellation which has only 1 mic outside. I had to returned it sadly. It could be a perfect product for this price and service. ——————————————————————- UPDATE They reached me with an email to find out what is wrong with the product and to ensure customer satisfaction. After mailing each other couple of times they sent me a replacement. I am glad they take the action cause i figured that the first headphone i got was defective! Now I don’t have any problem with the new headphone. Noise cancellation is perfect for its price level. Comparing to Bose NC700, Anker shows %75-%80 successful performance. Sound quality is really really good. Surprisingly rich and loud. Sometimes too much bass but you can turn extra bass off with a pyhsical button. I am very satisfied with their customer service and experience. Also with the product! 5 star.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-10-24,Awesome for 60 bucks!,"What I liked: • Price Point – $60.00 for a solid pair of Noise Cancelling headphones is a great price. • Battery Life: Rated at 40 hours of battery life. • Sound: This probably being the most important. The sound on these is really good. I’m not comparing them to the Sony or Bose Headphones of the world as that wouldn’t be fair since those brands cost so much more. • Noise Cancelling: Noise Cancelling built into this headphone does a pretty good job. Again, I’m not comparing to Sony or Bose. • Build Quality: These seem to be built well and I think they’ll last a while if taken care of. I do wish they came with a hard case. • Comfort: To me these are very light and comfortable. • Connection: Bluetooth 5 is always welcomed to reduce latency. What I didn’t like: • BassUp Technology: I like that these offer more a more bass option with the BassUp technology however I felt that it was a bit much and overall made the mids and highs quite a bit muddied. • Charge Port: Micro USB……It’s time for everyone to use USB C. • Carrying Case: I do wish these had a hard-shell carry case. Overall Experience: • Overall my felling on these is for $60.00 it’s a win. I would recommend these to anyone that needs a solid pair of headphones that sound nice.

Anker made an impressive headphones for under $60!!! If you are looking for an impressive sounding pair of headphones without breaking the bank then you found your pair! Let me go over the details General Specs The Life QC20 pack bluetooth 5.0, active noise cancelling, Hi Res Audio and 40 hours of battery life with ANC on! The headphones could be used in a wireless or wired mode and come with an auxiliary cable if your phone supports an auxiliary jack but mine does not so I have to use them in wireless mode. The headphones come with a carrying pouch, too I was hoping it's hard carrying case vs a pouch so I don't have to worry much about the headphones while they are in my gym bag. Design and BuildThe headphones are very stylish and well built. Out of the box, you feel you're handling $300 headphones and not $59 headphones. The black and graphite grey colors are perfectly balanced and the headphone adjustment mechanism is spot on, not stiff or loose. The ear pads are memory foam wrapped in faux leather, they are comfortable on the ear but I hoped they would be a tad bigger and wrap around the ear. The buttons are big enough and easily accessible, thumbs up to Anker! SoundThe headphones sound great, maybe if you're an audiophile you will have different opinion but they sound better than my beats that cost 3 times as much. I did not find active noise cancelling effective at low volumes but once I turned it up to 40% and above I could not hear anything but my music. The range of the bluetooth 5.0 allows you to enjoy crystal clear sound over 30 feet away. Battery LifeThe battery life on those headphones is impressive with 40 hours of playback with ANC on! Turn off ANC can you can extend the battery significantly. I really never needed to turn the headphones past 50-60% so I was able to get the 40 hours of battery life on a single charge easily. Obviously, if use the headphones in wired mode then battery life is of no issue. I can't believe what Anker was able to do with those headphones for under $60. They have a great battery life, excellent sound, good noise cancelling, wired and wireless modes and support bluetooth 5.0. If you are not looking to spend $300-$400 on a pair of ANC headphones and not an audiophile then those are headphones for you. Now Anker just needs to release a hard carrying case for them, you can do it Anker!! !",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The build quality is solid, and I do not see any major flaws. The only thing I would have wished was to have a more solid folding mechanism for the headphones. Because sometimes when I try to fold up the headphones, the ear cups meet in such a way that it presses the buttons on the left earcup. But that is a very minor flaw, and it should not prevent anyone from buying the headphones. The setup was super easy. All I had to do was, enable the Bluetooth on my phone. Then I put the headphones into pairing mode by holding the power button until the blue light started blinking fast, and selected the headphones which showed up on my phone's Bluetooth list. Onto the sound quality. I have gotten decent bass, mids and highs from the set. The noise cancellation works surprisingly well. Even when I don't have any music playing, the noise cancellation works to minimize most of the outside noise, though it could be a bit smoother. When I have music playing, I do not hear a single noise from the outside. I also like the fact that they include an auxiliary cable in case you want to go wired for your listening experience. The case that is included in the box is also very nice. Though I wish a hard case was included instead, but for the price it is okay. The charging was also relatively quick, and I had no outliers in terms of charging time, meaning that it always charged within a reasonable amount of time.

The Anker Soundcore Life Q20 are nowhere near the level of the premium ANC headphones yet at the entry level range they are more than worthy investments that can be used on a daily basis. As a frequent traveler, I have tried the Soundcore on a variety of flights (1 hr, 4 hr, and 12 hr) to really see how they feel. Here's a quick synopsis: 1: Audio quality is acceptable, but not ""elite."" You don't get the full range of mids, the bass isn't quite punchy... but it's acceptable. 2: The ACN feature is a step below the premium models. Cabin noise is a lot more prevalent, engine noise will trickle in too. I was a little surprised how much I could hear of the world around me in this context, and was definitely a bit disappointed with this feature. 3: However, the battery life is stupid good. If you are on any long haul flights, you may not even need to recharge these for the return legs. I clocked 40+ hours on one charge, which absolutely blew me away. Assuming you're not wearing it 2-3 hours a day on top of a long flight, you're good to go. 4: Ahh, bluetooth. What great range you have! Take a stroll up the cabin with the headphones on and there's a good chance you won't go out of range. Really wonderfully done. 5: Comfort is, once again, acceptable. They feel a bit taunt on the head after more than 2 hours. My ears were gasping for fresh air, at that rate. All in all, these are not perfect and definitely not made to last for 3-5 years.

The set is easy to get connected via Bluetooth pairing, with my Android Phone and Windows 10 laptop. They're stylish with clean design. The buttons are easily accessible and have the standard set of functions you'd expect from a set like this. The audio quality is great and the bass enhancement does drive the bass up considerably. The retail packaging is nice but not something that I really care all that much about. Delivery was on time and the package arrived undamaged. The noise cancellation is pretty awesome. This is the first set of headphones I've owned that have noise cancellation, so for me there was a high ""gee-wizz"" factor. ;>}. The noise cancellation was fantastic for blocking out background noise, and when my Mic worked, people could hear me clearly, even in the worst of background noise conditions. Initially I was impressed. High-end features for a budget price. I picked the over ear style because I work in loud environments and needed to be on calls while working in those areas. This is where I ran into my issues with the product. Many times I'm required to be on calls or in on-line meetings while in loud areas of our factory. Sometimes the headset worked perfectly fine - everyone could hear me and I could hear everyone else. I could also watch videos and hear audio from online music providers. However, many times when in online meetings or while on phone calls, the Mic would not work. Several times, the headset would spontaneously disconnect from my phone or my PC with no apparent reason. If I'm using my PC, I disable the Bluetooth on my phone and vicea-versa. The recommended fix from support was to forget the headset on all devices, power it off, plug into a power source and perform a hard reset. I did that several times but it has not resolved that issue. Another problem I have is there's and extremely loud popping, like a bad connection in the headset. If the headset is shifted too much or if, while walking I go down stairs or step too hard, the headset makes a very loud popping noise. I'm currently working with support to get an RMA. Hopefully the next set works better. If I had not run into these issues, I would have ranked these at a 4, or better. ************************** UPDATE ***************************** Soundcore customer service and tech support are top notch. My replacements were on the way immediately after my RMA'ed set shipped out. I don't know that I've ever had a better customer service experience. They kept me updated, checked in on me during the process and followed up after I received the new set, to ensure I was satisfied with my replacement. The replacement set was brand new in retail packaging. Exactly as if I purchased a new set off the shelf. I work in loud areas of my factory but these things make you feel like you are working in your own private studio! Crystal clear calls, bad @$$ audio playback, and Skype, Zoom and WebEx calls are flawless. People are constantly asking me which headset I'm using. I'm floored by the performance of these. Sure its a budget price there's no expense spared with the components and output of these babies. Not just in calls but the active noise cancelling, the bass response and the mid/ high range audio properties. I don't get that ear-piercing audio from the highs, just nice balanced highs and mids. Bump up the bass and you start thinking your 2 Pac or Biggie bumpin' to your favorite jams. Rock, classic rock, rap, hip Hop, anything you want to listen too just sounds better with these. I know you want to impress people around you by getting Bose, Sony's, Harmon Kardon or Sennhiser headsets, but you'd be a fool. Actually I'm going to point and laugh at people that pick those brands over those because they wasted their money in a failed attempt to look cool. Thanks for taking such good care of me, Soundcore team! you've made a customer for life.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2019-11-09,Exceptional value with a couple of vices. Awesome customer service.,"To begin with build quality is reasonable - when I held it in my hand for the first time, I was shocked how light it was. No breaks so far; but below are my speculations. The usual points of failure are the swivel joints of the cups and the slider mechanism for the headband. The swivel joints are made of good quality plastic, but I don't expect them to last for ever, as they are loaded when you wear the headphones. But my main concern is the headband - fixed metal with plastic sliding over it. This is a recipe for disaster. The rigidity of the metal band and the plasticity of the plastic slider results in the plastic slider disintegrating at around the one year mark. Ideally the plastic slider should be reinforced with metal on the inside, so it becomes metal slider in a metal band. I'll update if I decide to have this till then. This has not been an issue after 7 months. Speaks volumes about the quality of plastics used. Skullcandy can learn a thing or two from this model. One aux cable and a micro USB charging cable were provided in the box along with a pleather finished carry pouch. Comfort is - good. The cushions are kinda small and may make them ""over the ears"" if you have larger earlobes, but I don't have this problem and I have no complaints. The cushions are soft enough and there clamp force is not excessive. It is freezing here, so can't comment about how it reacts to sweat and hot weather - something for an update. Sound quality is above average for it's price. The bass is a little boosted, not overdone - but it is muddy. There is no separation at the lower frequencies and you can't resolve the different instruments and the different tones. The mids are there with better resolution and the highs are slightly recessed. Overall not tiring or shrill and just about worth it for the price. No aptX support here, so I expected latency, but surprisingly, there is none. Can definitely use this for watching movies and videos. I suspect this is the reason for the general lack of separation and resolution in the otherwise good sound. I didn't like the bassup feature, makes the already muddy lows muddier. Noise cancelling is great for this price, almost all the lower frequencies - road noise, water flowing., etc are filtered out almost completely. People speaking, not at all. But this is quite impressive to say the least. It almost has the Sony XB950N1 (IMO one of the worst built headphones ever) beat in noise cancelling, which is impressive at this price point. Connection strength is impressive, I can now move around the house (or move the music source) without the music being interrupted (there are other actions that do that, more on that later). Bluetooth 5.0 seems to do the trick here. Battery life is also impressive, I expect to hit the claimed 30 hour mark easily. Now the issues I've had with the device 1. Even though this is the costliest headphone, and the latest one at that, in the soundcore website, it looks like this is NOT the flagship product in the headphone category. The soundcore app doesn't support the life series (only the true wireless earbuds and the Space NCs, the previous flagships, are supported). So, no way to adjust the sound profile. 2. When I walk normally (or when I am not absolutely still) with these headphones on, there is a faint creaking/vibrating sound coming from the cans - like a small weight mounted at the end of a horizontal spring is vibrating due to the movement. This is an isolated issue, didn't happen with the replacement I received. 3. The bigger problem is when I eat something (move the jaw) or when I walk fast or when the vehicle hits a small bump in the road, there is a short jarring high picthed screech which is very irritating, to say the least. This is what I need to see if I can live with. This is prevalent in all three of these headphones I've used so far. So, if the ride is tough, you will have to switch NC off. So, is it a good value proposition? On a normal day, it is. There are not that many better options at the price point of $50. If NC is important then none as good till you hit the $150 price range. But with Thanksgiving around and the Sennheiser HD4.50 BTNCs discounted at $80, I believe it is a better deal to shell out the $30 for the Sennheisers, only if you are okay with the Sennheiser quality of uninspiring, but very high quality sound. The Sennheisers have bluetooth 4.0 with aptX support. Which should be fine. But at the end of the day, if you can live with the small niggling problems, these are a steal at around the $50 price range. The Sennheisers above had a vice like compression which became very uncomfortable very soon. [UPDATE] reduced rating because the power button is acting weird. Not powering on or off most of the times. Also cannot double press it to connect the second device. I have to put the headphone on charge for the power button to work exactly once after that to turn the device on or put it in pairing mode. After pairing the power button again goes back to not working. I am trying the reset (charge while long pressing power * volume+ buttons). Will update rating if the reset fixes the issue. Else i will have to make a warranty claim. (UPDATE) Raised a warranty claim with the description of the problem, and received a replacement within a week. Almost no questions asked. The new one works great, at least for now. But honestly I didn't expect this to last this long and perform this well, for it's price. So, definitely worth the price and I would highly recommend - especially if you are about to buy a Skullcandy - these sound much more balanced (better implementation of bass boost) and are better built at a third the price. Can't go wrong with these.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I got them in mid October and have only charged them twice since then, and one of those charges wasn't because it was out of battery, but because I was leaving on that cross country trip and wanted to get them topped up. When traveling I don't have to bring a charging cable as I know it will stay charged the entire trip. The noise cancellation is exactly what I wanted - I can still hear that a train announcement is happening and pause my music to hear what it is, but I can't hear the roar of the train, and it dampers the loud conversations happening around me.

You put these bad boys on and your surroundings just fade away. Now, I wouldn’t go as far to say they’re perfect but you get more than what you pay. Sound quality is pretty decent, which means it’s high in bass to mask the deficiencies elsewhere. It’s nothing too bad if you love bass, but if you’re an audiophile you’re not looking at this product most likely. I enjoy listening to my songs on these more than my AirPods and almost as much as my older Bose Quiet Comforts, so when you consider the price these are pretty amazing. Only con to the whole Q20 experience is the quality of life features. These things are a bit bulky and big, and they take a relatively long time to turn on and connect and to turn off. The buttons are big and easy to use, but that’s about the only convenience of the headset. They’re also very comfortable (weight aside) and easy to wear for a few hours without your head getting uncomfortable. The sound isolation is also near ideal for a close-back headphone as well. All-in-all, I love these cheap guys and I will probably use them the most out of all my other headphones. EDIT: Buttons stopped working after 6 months of use.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-19,"Awesome headphones, especially for the price! Gimmicky features.","Pros: I'm no audiophile, but the sound comes through crisp and clear—much better, in fact, than my wife's Skullcandy headphones that cost her nearly twice as much. They're foldable, adjustable, fit well, and are super comfortable, even for long periods of wearing. The bluetooth has an amazing range. I can leave my phone charging, go anywhere in my house or even a bit out into the yard, and these headphones stay connected. The option to use the included audio cable is great too. I tend to use the cable for my PC and bluetooth for my phone. Cons: The noise cancellation and BassUp features are kinda gimmicky. That's okay by me, as I didn't buy these for those features. But if they're why you want to buy them, you might reconsider. Noise cancellation works, but only a little. It really just kind of dims the external sound a bit, but it's very far from silent—and that's including the steady droning kind of sounds that noise cancellation is really intended to overcome. Don't get me wrong, the noise level is better with cancellation on than off, and since you have it, you might as well use it. But if you really need noise cancellation, you should probably get some pricier headphones more specifically designed for that. As for the bass boost, honestly, I can't hear any difference at all. Maybe it's just me. My wife tried it and said she thought the bass boost was amazing, so who knows. But it didn't do anything for me. Summary: Honestly, I'd just ignore the fact that this features BassUp and noise cancellation, because without them, this would still be an amazing pair of headphones for an amazing price! Buy them for that reason. If you need good noise cancellation or really heavy bass, probably look elsewhere.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

It does make a difference when the noise cancellation is off or on. It is so comfortable too! One thing I noticed it doesn’t have a mic on the auxiliary cord, which I use for my Xbox. But no big deal, I can get a third party aux cord with a mic specifically for my Xbox. Other then that, I love the headphones.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-22,"Great pair of very comfortable, audiofile grade headphones at an affordable price","I absolutely love this pair of headphones. Having had a pair of bose qc3 headphones several years ago, these rank on par with, and in my own personal opinion are better than, those headphones. I've read a few reviews that say the noise canceling are average, if that, but I personally and politely disagree. You don't really need the noise canceling on to shut out the world almost completely, when you put them on, even when turned off, the world is sht out, instantly. Some sounds, particularly loud, low frequency sounds, like air conditioners or washers or dryers can get through, but most other sounds don't. Turn on the noise canceling and even those sounds fade. The sound quality is fanfastic as well, deep rumbling base, clear mids and clear, resonant highs. I am not an audiofile, that is, I don't have a studio job or wear thousand dollar studio grade headphones but in my own personal opinion these sound just as good as those, although I have never worn such headphones. The bass up is the only part I'm not 100 percent happy with these headphones. The bass does increase when the bass up function is turned on, but the rest of the audio tends to fade a bit and become a little indistinct, suggesting that they might want to improve that algorithm a bit, but other than that these headphones are flawless. The build construction is stirdy and well thought out, although for 60 dollar headphones I was hoping for some metal construction, in the main user parts, the earcups and hinges, instead of plastic, but the memory foam earcups and headband enfold and cratle your head the minute you put them on. The battery life is also outstanding, lasting nearly three full days with nearly three full days of solid listening, I had to slep for nearly 16 hours after staying up that long but I did stay up that long to test. I would have liked a better quality case, in other words a nice leather hard shell case instead of the pleather bag they come with, but that's a minor quibble. If you're looking for a fantastic pair of headphones with equally fantastic noise canceling circuits, these can't be beat.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I bought these headphones to use them mainly while traveling with the bus or as a passenger in a carpool. While in motion, with ANC turned on, these headphones are producing some popping sounds at every road bump or any kind of shake. Same thing when walking. This is not happening when the ANC is turned off. I tested two identical headphones because first I asked for a replacement thinking that maybe only the item that I got was defective. Then, while filtering 1* and 2* reviews only, I found out that some other people had the same issue. Somehow, the large number of 5* and 4* reviews, tricked me... Lesson learned. Another bad thing is the customer support from this vendor, for what I would give 0 stars if I could. I wrote them a message and explained all these things and they replied this: "" From your description, it appears the issue is with the design or how the headphones work. Regarding the noise, it sounds like the wind/outside noise is hitting the external microphones and overpowering them causing them to make a popping noise through the ear speakers. So I'm afraid a replacement wouldn't solve the issue. In this case, we will be glad to help you with a refund if you returned them back to us. We will send you a prepaid shipping label for the returning. "" In the cars and the buses that I ride is NO WIND at all. About the noise from the road, yes, there is noise of course, but that's what the ANC feature of these headphones is supposed to cancel, isn't it!?! ... and, more important, this noise is the main reason why I bought them.

I refuse to spend $350+ on a pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones that I don't plan on using every day of my life for the next 5 years. I'd seen the Anker's online many times when doing research for a recent international trip. I wanted to get a newer pair of over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones to update my 20 yr-old on-ear Aiwas (that still work!). I saw a $10 coupon and jumped. I was skeptical though, would a $50-$60 pair be able to do the job at least half as well as a $350 pair of headphones? Well that paid off because these headphones do the job and they do it well, at least on an airplane. I haven't tried wearing them out on the street to see how well they filter traffic and ambient noise. But on an airplane, 5 stars. Battery life seems to be as advertised. They stayed on for over 24 hours of round trip flight time as well as a couple of additional hours in a hotel room with plenty of juice to spare. Didn't need to be recharged at all. The automated battery life indicator says, ""medium"" when I turn them on after the trip. Color me impressed. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a good set of wireless noise cancelling headphones for any plane ride. I will say, I'm not an audiophile so I can't speak to the sound quality, but everything sounded good to me while watching movies and TV and listening to a little bit of music. If you're a major audiophile though, I guess you wouldn't be looking at these headphones to begin with, right?",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I did not like them. However, after rating them at 3/5 stars, AnkerDirect contacted me about sending me a free replacement. I was pretty surprised they actually cared! I asked them to send me a Q10 instead. I love it! I would suggest going with the Q10 if you don't like noise cancellation or if you're unsure you'll use it a lot. I love these headphones - the sound is awesome, the battery lasts a while, they're comfortable to wear, easy to connect to Bluetooth but they have one critical flaw: the active noise cancellation just flat out sucks. If you're walking around with it on, and you step off a curb you get a terrible high pitch noise. You can turn this off, but the headphones ALWAYS default to having noise cancellation on... so you always have to shut it off if you don't like it. One other annoying thing - the buttons to turn the headphones on often get hit when you fold them up, so you have to carefully fold them up and hope they don't accidentally turn themselves on. This isn't a big deal with how long the battery lasts, but it just seems like another oversight on Anker/Soundcore. How hard is it to place the buttons somewhere where they don't get activated when you use one of the best features of these headphones (compact size if folded for carrying when not in use). I would recommend looking at Soundcore Q10 instead. It's slightly cheaper, and doesn't have noise cancellation so you avoid the annoyance of it always activating. I almost want to return these and get the Q10s instead, but I already opened the box and used them for a week or two. Next time I'll avoid noise cancellation.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The headphones were comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time, but I just wish the opening you put your ears in was just a slight bit wider. I do have bigger ears then most so it's probably a ""just me"" thing. Build quality is actually pretty decent, now you're not gonna mistake these for higher end headphones but they are certainly nice headphones. Sound quality is ""fine"" in that Soundcore went with a more neutral sound, so if you like bass these won't be for you. Speaking of bass the ""bass up"" feature kinda just made everything sound muddy and wasent really worth it. As for the noise cancellation, well it's good in it of itself meaning that it does block out a lot of noise but it does have a lot of cabin pressure so I didn't feel nice to my ears. And trying to play music WHILE the noise cancellation was on was a mixed bag. For some odd reason I needed the headphones to have a ""perfect"" seal around my ear and if I didn't have this seal when ever the bass on any song kicked in there's was a feed back. Honestly this is why I had to return them, because if I say TILTED MY HEAD DOWN this would affect the seal on my ears and cause this reverb sound, it also didn't help that I have glasses. Such a shame because I had a pair of their ""Vortex"" headphones and tried their ""Space NC"" headphones and thought they were awesome but these only sounded ""meh"" to me and that constant issue with the reverb made these a no go for me.

Now, they sound great except the extremely loud bass for how cheap they are. I dropped the 60hz range by 7db and the 100hz range by 4 dB and they sound OK. I'm glad Jetaudio has an eq, otherwise the heavy bass would get annoying. Oh and there's also a mode for EVEN MORE BASS. Seriously?

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-12-13,Decent quality noise cancelling headphones at a low price,"This is an excellent entry level noise cancelling headphone set. The sound quality is pretty good, better than most people are likely used to if they use ear/airpods or other low quality earbuds or headsets, but not audiophile quality. Music and podcasts generally sound rich and full, if a bit bass heavy and with slightly muddy low end. If you've never used a high quality pair of headphones, you will probably be quite happy with this level of sound quality. They are noticeably closed in in terms of soundstage, though you still get directional differences clearly coming through. The build quality is fine, nothing to write home about. The plastic hinges are slightly creaky and don't feel extremely solid, but neither does it feel like the headphones will break unexpectedly or snap in my hands. If treated well I would not be surprised if they lasted several years or more. The band and earcups are comfortably padded. I find the earcups to be a bit small, but my ears are somewhat large. This can cause pain and soreness in my ears with extended wear (more than 2 hours without much break). However, this pair is better than others I've tried, and the problem is not unique to these. The earcups can get a bit hot and insulative, especially in higher ambient temperatures, but taking breaks once in a while mitigates this almost completely. As others have noted, these headphones create a sharp ""crack"" or ""pop"" in certain circumstances. I have noticed that they can produce this crack with every step on a hard surface if I walk with a very heavy step, but that they do not do this if I walk with a moderate or light step. They also seem not to do it on carpeted or otherwise soft surfaces. The effect can be replicated by closing a car door while wearing the headphones, so it seems to have something to do with rapid air movement around the noise cancelling microphones. Bottom line on the crack/pop issue: These are not going to work for running or people who walk on hard surfaces regularly with a heavy step (do you ""stab the floor"" with your feet? don't buy these). If you don't do that, it should be fine. If your use case is mostly sitting at a desk or couch or table and listening to music or podcasts or TV, these will work very well. The noise cancelling is not top of the line by any means, but it is effective in significantly reducing lower to medium frequency constant noise. Wearing these inside a Chipotle restaurant made the auditory experience significantly more pleasant. Further, these headphones cover the sound of high speed laptop fans very effectively. Listening to music while driving a car with these eliminates over 90% of perceived external noise for me, including your own engine and tire noise. These are not Bose QuietComforts, but they get the job done decently. In conclusion: these are excellent headphones for a $60 price point (the price I paid) and the current $40 deal makes them an absolute steal. If you want to try out noise cancelling headphones, or want a cheap but decent pair for travel or some other purpose where you don't want to risk high price headphones, these are a great choice. If you have particularly large ears, I would find another option with larger earcups. If you want to run or you're the kind of person to stab the floor with your feet, find another option.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

First, as comfortable the headphones may seem, my head must be shaped weird or small, as they seemed a tad too large putting pressure on the top of my ears. Second, while the sound was decent, bass was too boomy for my liking and we're not well balanced. They favored the lows more than the highs. Just not for me. Finally, noise cancelling wasn't the best, but did the job around the home and office. The sound quality however was affected slightly for the worse when enabled. Battery life was excellent, especially with noice cancelling off, and for the price, these seemed like a great deal. Again, as a big Anker fan and owner of many of their products, I truly had high hopes for these.

Thanks anker and I bought the headphone with my own money and anker did not send me anything for free this is all me and I'm not really a reviewer writer where you have 3 pages of review I'm just a sums up guy. On 12.31.19 After testing it for 2 weeks I found some cons but very minimal and everything good. The good The sound quality gets better the more you use it the better it gets so they require certain amount of burn ins. As far as noise cancelling it is doing what it suppose to I mean I paid like $40 for the amount of perks I got on these the high resolution audio codec is enough for me to like these headphones lot. The bad It's a small price to pay but it only happens when ANC is turned on so while I have the headphones on my head and I tried to close the door on the car I hear a static noise o don't know if it's a hardware issue or software it's just happens for that second but you definitely hear it and also when your adjusting the headband for headphones than you will hear it too again it doesn't bother me maybe it will bother some people. Also I really haven't tested the headphones while walking or in the wind haven't had that situation yet so once I test them while it's windy and or when j walk I'll write it down. Again for $40 this doesn't bother me I'll use this while sitting down if I have to I'll use my bose for walking and windy situation, but I really like the headphones. Updated!!!!!! !1.13.2020 I spoke to anker about the popping noise when I adjust the headband it only happens when ANC is active and you also hear the noise when you close the car door and also happens if their is a bump on the road so anyway I emailed anker and they stated that the updated version doesn't make that noise and that we as anker will send new headphones and return the defective one back so that's what I did and if anyone has the same problem just contact anker and they will send a prepaid postage and once they know the headphones is reroute they will send tracking number for a new headphones and yes I received it today and yes the popping noise is their no more yesss!!! Anker goes above and beyond to take care of their customers and now they have a long life customer and will continue to buy anker products and of their is any issues with it just a email will resolve the problem that your having.

A decent noise cancelling product well under $100?? I used the headphones at my local rollerskating rink on a Sunday afternoon. The objective was to be able to comfortably listen to my own music on the floor. A far challenging scenario than the simple drone of an aeroplane engine. Boy was I surprised. The headphones were able to reduce the rink's music down to a whisper.... and reduce the ambient sounds of a very busy crowd! I was able to quietly immerse myself in my own music on the floor, and I'd call that a success! I didn't need to turn the volume all the way up either. I do not mind that the noise reduction is not 100%. Personally I like the ability to hear the outside world faintly. The sound quality does feel a little heavy on the bass, but the midrange and high end is decent enough. If I was picky, I can correct that with an equalizer. The headphone's over the ear padding is very comfortable, and admittedly adds a lot to the noise reduction. They do heat you up after about an hour strenuous activity, but remember, you're sealing off your ears. To be expected. I did hear occasional clicking when the headphones were jostled putting them on, but not while rollerskating or normal user. I don't recommend them for running or sweaty activities. I'd call this one a winner.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Listening to some old favorites by the Doors, songs I know really well so I can really check out the sound quality. And it's impressive. Clear, good imaging, the BassUp works well in bringing out the kick drum and bass playing without being boomy. Solid midrange, but the highs are lacking, especially with the BassUp EQ, there's no sizzle in the cymbals. The highs are somewhat better with Normal EQ. The overall sound quality is very listenable. UPDATE: I took them to the gym (very noisy) and the Active Noise Cancellation was AMAZING! It was almost spooky the way my world became so quiet when I put them on. The sound quality is excellent, and I really think the bass in rock-solid and the overall sound is better when you don't use the BassUp feature. I was very reluctant to wear over-the-ear headphones rather than my ear buds at the gym. I'm glad I changed my mind. Surprisingly simple set up, charged in about an hour, paired effortlessly, easy buttons that are quite finger friendly. Good quality build and look. Don't really have a sense of how well the Noise Cancellation works, but I'll take these to the gym (where nobody is listening to the canned music but it's real loud anyway).",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The build quality is on par with Bose and the customer service is as good as Bose and better than Apple. Overall I recommend this for anyone looking for a headset at this price point over other brands. I have tried few other brands sold in amazon at this price point including highly rated and reviewed ones. The other brands I tried fall behind this because of fit, build or sound quality. NC quality on all of them are either same as this or worse.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I will use the new ones and reply back after i have had them for a little while. Only time will tell how well they hold up. Update 3.30.2020 Updated review: 2 Stars I still stand by the original review in terms of sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life. Those continue to be exactly as they were. However: After just three short months, the once plush ear cups are just a flat lumpy mess. The foam inside does not stand up to daily use at all. The leather covers are also starting to dry out; its only a matter of time before they crack and peel. And lastly, the plastic body now creaks and groans every time i put them on, turn my head, or take them off. I honestly wonder whats going to happen first: The plastic is going to crack, or the ear cups are going to rip. Only time will tell. Original Review: 4 Stars Overall, I would say these are a solid buy for $60. Anker soundcore products continue to improve with each iteration, but they still have some room to grow. They aren’t *quite* up to par with Bose, but are probably up there with Sony or Sennheiser. Obviously, this is subjective to personal tastes, but I think these headphones actually have a pretty wide sound stage. The treble is clear without being shrill, mids sound good and in their own space and they don’t get left behind or crowded out by the bass, which is solid (and honestly better) without the bass boost (which is really more of an EQ change instead of a real change in amplified bass frequencies. I leave it off). Bass is punchy without feeling ridiculously warm or overpowering; Beats these are not. Ive also used these to listen to some tv and movies, and I feel like the dialogue is clear and present, while leaving enough room for the effects, background noise and music to all fit in together. But they aren’t without their drawbacks. They ear cups are super comfy, and I have actually fallen asleep with them on a few times, but the faux leather liner leaves no air in or out, so they don’t breathe at all and become a sweaty mess, even now in the winter. The band is nice and wide, so it fits my stupidly large head well enough, but the weight balance on your head feels a little top heavy, and I find myself adjusting them even when I’m not moving around. And the ANC actually kind of sucks. It works well enough to drown out light background noises, like typing on a keyboard, or even walking around an office building, but it isn’t strong enough to nullify a train ride or a plane engine, and the headphones don’t seem smart enough to figure out how remove constant white noise like a fan or heavy rain; that kind of noise actually seems to get drawn in by the mic, and I find that I actually get better passive noise control from the ear cups with the ANC off for noises like that. Again, these aren’t perfect, and they don’t have a fancy app with tons of bells and whistles to fine tune the experience, but they sound incredible and they were only $60. You also can’t find a better customer service experience anywhere else, Anker has literally never let anyone down. Ever. For that, I can live with their shortcomings.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

They emailed me pretty quick despite it being close to the holiday. They emailed me a prepaid label to return and as soon as I shipped through system they mailed out the replacement. Apparently mine was defective. They were very efficient about it and very nice. I received my replacement like 3 days ago and so far so good.

The same thing happens if you ride in the car or a bus and the vehicle hits the rough surface. when you have NC on... I took a long ride and was not able to use these earphones in the NC mode as I was getting so much static noise that made the whole user experience super annoying. These earphones work great if you want to use those to listen to the music sitting on the couch or in the office chair. Do not move or run or you will get static screeching noises. So disappointing. If you do not move, the sound is excellent though. Alternatively, you need to turn the NC off, if you expect a lot of movement / vibration -- so the NC feature is very limited in these earphones even though Anker advertises this pair as having NC...

My only real gripes are two: 1 - noise cancellation really sucks. There are a bunch of noises that cause loud poppings. I'm pretty sure the noise cancellation's input is being clipped, causing the resulting output to sound horrible. Things like making popping noises with your mouth or touching near the noise cancelation microphones causes this. I keep noise cancellation off because these pops are significantly louder than the music I'm listening to and actually hurt 2 - noise cancellation turns itself on every time you turn the headphones on. This would be fine if noise cancellation worked better, but as it is, it's kinda a pain to turn the headphones on and have to also disable NC every time. Bottom line: They're well worth the price. Noise cancellation may work great for you, or you may hate it, either way you're getting at least your money's worth. You get what you pay for, and you're not paying much for these. Update: this happens several times a day, without disconnecting bluetooth, my computer stops actually producing audio. It still says it's connected, and windows says it's playing music, or whatever through them, but nothing. 5 times a day, I have to reconnect bluetooth. this is almost as bad as having a cable. This was pissing me off so much, I tried the cable. Just by plugging the cable in, I get a strong 60hz hum, and the sound quality is trashed. I'm getting clipping and sound cuts out. These are trash.

I immediately looked in the user guide and found no answer that would cause this unit to become operable. I then requested to return the unit and receive a refund. As I have purchased Anker devices previously with great success, I re-ordered the exact same unit fully confident that my issue was an aberration. Unfortunately the second unit was exceedingly difficult to turn on and off, but it would eventually operate satisfactorily except when it didn't. I elected to put up with the problem as I did not desire to return another set. Then after a week of using the headphone while on vacation over the holidays, the headphones started repeatedly reporting that the noise cancelling was on, then about ten seconds later it would report that the noise cancelling was off. This would repeatedly occur every 10 to 15 seconds until I would have to hold both buttons down for a while to shut the headphones completely off. I gently laid them down, to keep from throwing them through the wall of my home and I then requested another return for my replacement headphones.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-08,"Replacement solved audio connection problems, now fully recommend","Update 2/4/2020, original review below Anker customer service reached out and sent me a replacement pair. I've now been using the replacements for about 1.5 weeks, and I can happily report that my issues with connection dropping are completely gone. Since that was my only real con with these phones, I'm updating to 5 star for both the value and for Anker's apparent dedication to customer satisfaction. -------------------------------------------------------------- I was pretty impressed with these headphones immediately after receiving them, but I've since come to the conclusion that they've got to go back. The short and sweet: Pros - sound quality is good when the bass boost is off; ear pads are comfortable; pairing process with Win10 laptop was easy; can have multiple sources connection; good price for the feature set; build quality is good; battery life is good. Cons - really just one, but it's a doozie. I have the headphones connected via Bluetooth to my Dell XPS 13 laptop, pretty much all day every day. They drop audio connection about every 3-5 minutes for several seconds at a time, occasionally dropping connection completely and then reconnecting, during which time the audio output defaults back to the built-in speakers, and switches back to the headphones once they reconnect. If this happened much more rarely, I could probably live with it, but as it is, it's enough of an annoyance that I'm going to ditch them and get something better. Prior to these headphones, I had a pair of Cowin E7's that never once dropped connection, and I only got rid of those due to the battery going kaput.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I was unsure of the quality I would be getting for set of NC Bluetooth headphones under $100, but the moment I opened these up I knew I had made the right choice. Turning these headphones on and placing them on my ears LITERALLY MADE MY JAW DROP HARD! I’m serious I was drooling! And knowing I didn’t have to spend $200 bucks to get some bangers had me in tears! There is no competition that I’ve found for the price! COMFORT: The comfort level is unbelievable IMO. The ear pads are very cushiony, soft and comfortable, very cool so they never really heat up or cause ear fatigue, and they have great swiveling ability. Hands-down the most comfortable over ear headphones I’ve ever owned; more comfy than most of the top models of leading brands. SOUND QUALITY: Very decent low-end, smooth and balanced mids with a slight swoop in the mids (preferred), and IMO I really like the high-end response! No shrillness to the highs nor is there a lack of clarity. These headphones are balanced well enough that you Can add or take away EQ if you’d like but they don’t necessarily need it. Some people have complained about these being too “bassy” but I did not find that to be true at all. I am a full-time Musician with a lot of experience and I know what I’m looking for personally. I could use just a tad more low end response but that’s basically negligible when looking at these as a whole. BATTERY LIFE: Shoot, the battery life will make you wanna slap yo’ grandma’s dentures out! Seriously the battery life on these is no joke and the fact that you can get around two hours of play time from just 5 minutes of charging...slap yo’ granddaddy’s toupee clean off his cue ball. Jk love on your grandparents! But ya the battery life is stupid goooooood! All right this review is getting a little long-winded and silly but whatever.

I tested it in my bathroom, with the fan running, and it cut it down by maybe half. Fan sounds should be easy to cancel out. This is the reason I’m not giving it a higher score overall. I bought them specifically for this feature, and it just doesn’t measure up. Update: 1/24/20 I've been using these for a few weeks, now, mostly in an office with light talking in the background and constant HVAC fan noise. I don't expect the ANC to do anything for the talking, but I do expect it to improve the fan noise. It doesn't reduce the fan sound; it just changes it slightly. The marketing materials for these claim that they ""instantly block"" up to ""90% of low and mid-range frequency noises."" Don't believe it. They would be totally acceptable headphones if they didn't market the ANC feature at all, because it's useless to the point that I don't even bother turning it on.

I have several other bluetooth headsets and the way this headset ""wobbles"" or cuts out is different than my others. The bluetooth was terrible. It randomly disconnected, and if you were more than maybe five feet from the computer (we tried on two computers) then it wouldn't work. (My other bluetooth headsets, even the earbuds, let us move across our apartment with no issues.) Also, the battery life wasn't as advertised. After charging, with the sound issues and only listening to youtube, my wife only got about 3-4 hours before the voice would come on and alert her to charge. We gave the product about two weeks (Christmas gift) to see if we could figure it out or were doing something wrong. My wife decided that even if it didn't have the technical or quality problems she wouldn't want it. She said it was extremely uncomfortable, and the headset didn't adjust enough to fit well.

Have owned Bose wired ANC headphones previously. Pros: The battery life is excellent. Used both wired and wirelessly, they persisted for over 30+ hours of travel on a charge. Battery was only midway depleted by destination and was easily topped up before return leg. Ear cups are comfy, albeit, after several hours, I did have some discomfort where apparently one of my ears must be a bit larger since there was a bit of an ache around the cartilage. A bit of shifting the headphones and it was ok. The headphones are light, so several hours of continuous wearing was pretty comfy (more comfortable than my prior Bose over the ears) and the wireless aspect was a great improvement. Sound was really nice - I'm no audiophile, but I was able to watch movies and listen to music quite nicely, even turning on the extra bass. Cons: ANC is a bit fickle. I suspect the microphones used to cancel out noise had something to do with things, but engine noise would be cancelled when facing certain directions and would then be more audible when I looked straight ahead. Somewhat annoying considering the engines are to my sides and I should be looking forward, for the most part. Part of what makes the headphones light and affordable also make it a bit cheap - as most of the body and the pivot joints appear to be made of plastic also. The plastic makes me feel that the joints will break. When you pull them out of the bag and spin the ear cups into position, you'll know what I mean as soon as you stretch them out to go over your head. The position of the power switch seems to invite unintentional/accidental power on. Twice found the unit powered on in the storage bag from accidental enablement. I'm pretty sure I powered them off before storing. But you never know. Since it happened more than once, I don't think it was a coincidence. That said, even powered on unintentionally, the battery life is such that an unintentional powering on was not an issue for the duration of a transcontinental flight. Painful static feedback was heard during takeoff. I have no idea why, but it also happened on more than one flight. Not a huge issue, but also somewhat annoying. For the price, you simply don't need to turn them on until after you've taken off, but just saying... The ANC wasn't fantastic, but good enough, especially given the price. I haven't decided whether or not to keep them, but at this price point, I think the ""good enough"" adds more weight to the value of these.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I am happy to report that these headphones are pretty damn good. The sound quality is clear and precise. They are comfortable to wear. The battery life is very good. I have to charge them once a week with daily office usage. The price point is stellar compared to the more well known brands. But the kicker is that these puppies knock down the sound of the world's loudest most annoying co-worker. Closed office walls and sound absorbing cubicles cannot contain the sound this harpy emits. There are dogs two counties over that wonder what that constant shrill is that spreads through the country side. This co-worker leaves no thought, no opinion, no gripe, no comment unspoken. We speculate that they are physically incapable of an internal monologue. In addition to this poor soul's inability to not comment on the office temperature or to announce that they are going to lunch, they also have what we call Spinal Tap Volume Syndrome. Meaning that when they say something, the volume is always at eleven. Long story short, where walls, sound dampening panels, and common courtesy have failed, these headphones have come to the rescue and have mitigated the constant threat of hearing damage and insanity.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2020-01-15,Anker Q20s need some TLC,"I ordered the Q20's to replace a set of stolen Sony XM3s. Didn't feel like dropping another three bills so my hope was that these would get me 80% of the way there. Unfortunately, these didn't meet my expectations. First, the sound quality was only so-so. The quality of the drivers was actually pretty good, but the EQ tuning is poor. I appreciate a flat frequency response and found the bass over exaggerated and mids and highs too recessed and muddy, even without the bass boost. They probably did this with some assumption of a target demographic, but I'd prefer Anker default to a more level EQ and let bass heads adjust from there. Second, the noise cancelling was also a bit disappointing. Granted, I was coming from the XM3 which are the best NC on the market. But I found these only marginally better than my old Sony MDR-ZX770's. I was still able to hear my Vornado fan and some ambient music wheras the XM3 cancelled those out completely. These will likely do great with airplane noise, but fall short on anything above a low rumble. Anker does win in some areas. I thought the headphones were quite comfortable if not a bit on the small side. Battery life was also on par with the rating. It was also a nice touch to add AAC codec support over Bluetooth instead of the more standard SBC. I can live with the noise-cancelling, but the EQ tuning was a bit too much for me. I ended up going with a pair of Mpow H12s which were more balanced and quite frankly a more quality pair of headphones for about the same price or less. These are 1 star headphones that get a 2nd due to the low price.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Do you need a $300 pair of headphones to listen to audiobooks or cancel out the noise of the neighbor's kids playing in their driveway?

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-01-20,"Great sound and noise cancellation, Ear cups a bit small","I bought these to replace my Sony MDR-XB905BTs that broke (after four years of cramming them into a bag without a case). The sound is very good. I’m not nearly as fond of the enhanced bass as I was with the Sony’s, but at a quarter of the price, I’m not complaining. The noise cancellation is not perfect, but is still great. A couple times I’ve noticed varying sound in the environment messing with my music sound levels, but it was minor and didn’t persist too long. I didn’t even buy these for noise canceling, but the first time I turned them on, I immediately pulled them off because the ambient noise ( which I was apparently accustomed to) suddenly and completely disappeared! Once I remembered the ANC, I put them back on and just enjoyed the quiet before turning on the music. My only real complaint is that I wish the ear cups were larger. These are just a tad too small, and I have to fool with them to get them situated just right or they bother me after a while, where the pair these replaced was a little bigger. The cups are soft and ready to wear for hours once I get them settled, though. Update after a month: the noise cancelling is really nice at work. I don’t fly, so can’t speak to how it works be on a plane. If you tap them, say reaching to take them off or change volume, the ANC sometimes reacts with quite a loud click. I’ve finally given up strictly due to the small ear cups. The left one is fine, the right drives me insane pinching the lowe earlobe, and I can’t stand to use them any longer. Otherwise, still happy with the sound quality (not an audiophile, but do like decent phones), just wish I had smaller ear(s).",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sound quality, comfort, and noise cancellation all punch above their weight. With that said, here are my qualms. Design – the ear cups swivel and fold, but the consolidated form factor feels unintentional and clumsy. The buttons feel cheap, like they belong on $10 headphones. UX – I have to press and hold the power button for 5 seconds, I believe, to power these off. This is very nitpicky, but when I’m packing these up, this feels like a chore. More importantly, the volume level on my MacBook Pro essentially becomes disabled when connected via Bluetooth to these headphones. I’d much rather use the OS volume controls rather than fumbling with the volume buttons on the side of the headphones. I know I’m being critical.

The things that I really liked about them: 1) I really liked the construction of the headphones; the felt like they were very well made, very close to premium quality. 2) I loved the design of them and they look really great on my head. They are beautiful looking headphones! 3) They were really comfortable; my girlfriend has BOSE QC35ii and I couldn't sense ANY comfort differences. 4) Some of the frequency range sounded really good, mostly in the mids and highs area. 5) The buttons were very responsive and they didn't feel cheap at all—on other headphones I tried, they did. The things that I didn't like so much: 1) These things have way way way too much bass and this is just in the normal bass mode. And the bass sounds kind of loose and not well defined. And when you turn on the BassUp feature, well, I really don't know how anyone could listen to music like that in that mode—they become super muddy sounding! Anyway, they have so much bass that I would say that the regular BassUp ""OFF"" mode should be the ""ON"" mode and the ""OFF"" mode should have considerably less bass. I had to go into my Macbook's EQ settings to pick some preset EQ modes to show just how much the bass needed to be turned down (and this is just in the normal BassUp ""OFF"" mode) to get them to sound better. ...SEE PICTURES of needed EQ settings. ***NOTE: iPods and iPhones are NOT easy to access the EQ settings as they are in: Setting>Music>EQ>Then select the EQ Preset you want—no Manual mode on iOS portables. *** 2) Other problems I was having were when I had them connected to my 2011 iPod. They would cause the music to skip or interrupt 1 to 3 times (almost every time) when I would scan through a track to a another section in a song (it would happen after the scanning) or when I would skip forward or backward to another track. I have other Bluetooth devices that this iPod does NOT do that with, including 3 Anker SoundCore Motion Plus speakers—which I really really LOVE, by the way—so the problem isn't my iPod. ***NOTE: I don't know if I just got a faulty headset regarding this issue but I was too afraid to try another headset. *** 3) The other issue I was having is: I was getting this noticeable volume up & down pumping or oscillations in the music whenever the A.N,C. (active noise cancellation) was ""ON""—it would not do this with the A.N.C. in the ""OFF"" position. Anyway, these volume oscillations would occur with nearly every device I would try them with: a 2011 iPod, a 2012 MacBook, a 2016 iPod, and a 2019 iPhone—it would be more noticeable with some songs than with others and also in some sections of songs rather than in other sections. It did not seem to do this with my Android LG phone but I don't use this for music—I very much dislike the Mp3 format due to the smaller files and the lack of any integrated seamless playback feature. Maybe these Anker QC20s work better with Mp3 formats rather than the Apple ACC formats, but who knows. ***NOTE: I don't know if I just got a bad headset regarding this issue but I was too afraid to try another headset. *** 4) The other thing that I didn't not care for was when the fan was blowing on me I could clearly hear amplified wind noise coming through the A.N.C. microphones which are suppose to help the A.N.C cancel out noice, but in this case they were actually accentuating it through headphone speakers. ***NOTE: this issue wasn't completely a deal breaker for me like all the other issues were but I could see how this would be a problem if I was outside using the A.N.C. on a windy day or if I was hot and I needed a fan directly on me. *** I really like most Anker products that I buy: the power banks, portable backup battery chargers for phones, their Bluetooth speakers (several models)...etc. Unfortunately though, these headphones just weren't able to do it for me this time. :-(",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The soft matte black finish is very nice. Ear cups are extremely soft and comfortable. I have a larger head (wear XL motorcycle helmet) and only had to extend the headband a little for the right fit. These prolly won't stay on small brained folks. The sound even in the non bass boosted mode is bass heavy. The sound is acceptable for their price range. Music gets plenty loud, but when paired to my FireStik and watching video, I could have used another couple notches up. The noise cancellation works much better than expected. My kids have the Cowin E7's and the NC actually works on these. The E7's I can barely hear any difference between NC and non-NC. As others stated, lower tones get filtered out much better than higher tones. The popping that others have reported is present. I tried making this happen when I received them and could not. After 2 days, I noticed the popping when I put them on with the power already on. If I quickly unseat and reseat the earcups I can recreate the pop. If I jump up and down really hard it also happens. So these are probably not the best for exercise or heavy activity. I had to REALLY try to make it happen so for my purposes of sitting in the office, working with moderate activity in a noisy area with lots of fans and A/C units running, the occasional flight, they should perform fine. I agree there should be no popping whatsoever, and this is a serious flaw. For me I don't plan to return them as I like them very much except for this and I don't think it will be an issue for me. Should they become more sensitive and the popping increase, I will contact Anker. I've owned many Anker products and all have exceeded my expectations.

That said, the passive isolation is pretty good. I have no issues with these in an office environment. * On-headset controls are a little clicky and a little clumsy, but you eventually get used to where everything is. * Still haven't figured out how to reliably activate Siri from the headphones on an iPhone 8 running iOS 13 -- I get the ""listening"" Siri chime right away, but then it immediately stops listening. I don't really care about the feature, just thought I'd note it in case others were experiencing similar issues. * Finally, sound quality is definitely acceptable but a little muddied.

Practically as soon as I started using the replacement unit, the same terrible rattling sound occurred once the bus I was on went over a patch of bumpy road. I believe this model has a fundamental design flaw and cannot recommend it. I'm usually all-in on Anker and I've had plenty of success with their products, but at least the unit I received has flaws that render it essentially unusable. The noise canceling technology is extremely sensitive to vibrations, it would seem; while I have them on walking down the street, if I step just a bit too lively, the headphones make a deafening rattling noise that probably would cause hearing loss. The same thing happens on a bus if it goes over even the slightest bump.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-02-01,"Good value overall, but glitchy ANC","Overall, these are very strong headphones at their price point. Sound quality is impressive. The bass is very heavy (even in the ""normal"" equalizer mode), which is great for bass-heavy genres but a bit funny for Stravinsky. The Bluetooth is strong--I can listen clearly from my phone one or two rooms over--and the headphones are very comfortable. I am quite happy with the battery performance; the battery lasts longer and charges faster than the battery on my phone. The buttons on the headphones are fine: they lack the control features and the tactile solidity that you will find on headphones at higher price points, but at this price point the button controls are perfectly satisfactory. This brings me to the active noise cancelling feature. On the positive side, the ANC creates a pleasant sound stage and produces none of the uncomfortable pressure sensation that I have often experienced with other ANC devices. The ANC is quite effective for low to mid frequencies. It doesn't much attenuate higher frequencies, but high frequencies are somewhat passively attenuated by the headphones themselves. All in all, the ANC is not effective for things like chatter and crying babies, but it is effective at removing lower frequency noises like trucks and fans. However, the ANC has a serious problem. When activated, the ANC occasionally produces a very sharp cracking noise that is loud enough to be moderately painful. This glitch seems to be correlated to pressure fronts (like closing an airlock door), and to movement. Even walking can trigger this glitch; stairs and the gym are out of the question. I am quite disappointed in this problem; it is a sharp drawback to what would otherwise be an excellent pair of headphones meriting a five star rating. The bottom line is that these are excellent headphones for sedentary use only.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-05,Kinda Blown Away,"First, I’m no audiophile. Second, this is my first pair of ANC earphones. That said, I’m very impressed and think this is an amazing set of earphones for the price. The first thing I did when I got them (after pairing them) was try out the noise cancellation feature. I happened to have a lot of laundry running so I went in my laundry room (closet, really), closed the door, and tried them out. The noise in the room when from a loud rumble to an almost imperceptible hum. Really amazing. I turned off the ANC just to make sure it wasn’t just noise isolation and it wasn’t, though the noise isolation is good, the ANC is what really does the magic. I’ve tried these on plane trips as well, and they do a very good job; sitting at a window seat (where it’s loudest) the din of the plane went from a loud, low ruble to a higher pitched soft rumble - not quite a hiss but perhaps what one might get from a white noise maker. Not bad for noise cancellation alone, but when listening to or viewing media, the difference is amazing. Finally, I can hear the full efffects of a movie without turning the volume all the way up. Honestly, after using these earphones I don’t think I can ever go back to being without ear protection on a plane, for me or my family. That said, I won’t say the audio quality is outstanding. It’s good enough, with good range, adequate volume and decent base, but it’s not at audiophile level. But because they have ANC it’s actually possible to hear music or other audio in situations where normally you wouldn’t barely hear anything, and that’s the big difference. Does Bose do a better job of noise cancellation and audio quality? Probably. But I’d never spend $200-$300 on a pair of headphones just to use on the plane, especially since paying that much for for every member of my family would break the bank. But at the price of these Ankers it’s a no brainer to get a set for everyone.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-05,Decent for the price,"I work in a very high white noise area some areas are a constant 100+db of just white noise. I had a set of Philips SHB8750NC/27 that I have been using nearly daily for 2 years. The Philips were ANC and BT and they did a decent enough job at blocking out a lot of noise while also sounding pretty decent for the $15 I paid for them on a Walmart clearance sale(originally $100). Now I have never used a set of high end ANC headphones from Sony or Bose, but I think the Q20s do a great job at blocking the white noise out. They seem to do better than the Philips I was using previously. I have noticed that I have to have the Q20s sitting on my ears just the right way to take full advantage of the ANC. If you are wanting to use these while doing some sort of active activity they might not seal as well while moving around. For people who travel or have a job that is primarily sitting these are perfect. They also sound pretty decent for the cost. Bass is pretty forward even with the BassUP/Boost set to off, but it isn't unbearable. I would like maybe a little more mids, but I guess that's what EQ is for. All in all I'm pleased with what Anker/Soundcore has put out. I just hope they will hold up and last like my Philips, which are still working 100%.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker has been pretty solid from my experiences and I had read good reviews, so I went ahead and bought these. And I've gotta say, they have left a great first impression on me. In the package is: - A sleek pair of headphones - A microUSB cable - A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable - Headphone storage bag I wear glasses and have had several negative experiences with headphone comfort, so I was anxious until these arrived. I'm pleased to say there aren't any issues at all. The headphones don't squeeze my glasses into my face or ears. In fact, these headphones are surprisingly comfortable; the ear cushions are soft and feel amazing. The headband comfort isn't as impressive, but it's not an issue either. I'm not an audiophile but the sound quality is better than what I expected for the price. It's comparable to my Bose QC25s, and I've even found myself using these instead sometimes. I'm not an expert though. The bass boost is a nice bonus feature, but can be enabled or disabled easily. The noise cancelling is great. It's not as good as the QC25's, as I can sometimes hear small crackling when walking. It's quiet enough to ignore though, especially with music playing over it. However, the transition from off to on is incredibly smooth. For contrast, the QC25's noise cancelling has a ""pop"" when turned on, which definitely took getting used to. At times, I would find myself taking off those headphones before turning on the noise cancelling feature. With these, the noise cancelling is almost seamless. There's not much to say about the buttons, they're great. They're easily reachable, they're easily pressable, they're very intuitive, and they're not an issue. The bass feature can be toggled on or off by double-pressing the play button. Overall, these headphones are looking quite strong. They look and feel like premium quality headphones, something I'd expect to pay double the price for. I only wish I could have bought these instead of the QC25s, since these are a fraction of the price and are easily comparable. I've been impressed with everything so far, so hopefully I'll be impressed by the durability as well.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-07,Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!,"First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer.. That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about. Active Noise Cancellation: Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else.. Sound: I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones.. They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case.. Quality: The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid! Functionality: A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily! Battery: The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain! Packaging: The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them.. Overall: Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Well worth the purchase,"I bought these to listen to music while I work. I wanted something more comfortable than ear buds, over the ear and with either active or passive noise cancelling. Honestly, I didn't expect quite so much for the money! These are great anyway, but especially at the price. You really can't go wrong. No, they're not Bose or Harman Karden or anything like $300 headphones ... and no the noise cancellation isn't as good either .... but still, its pretty good! That said, f you come with realistic expectations you'll be pleased. If I had a criticism ... and its small ... its that the 'phones try too hard on the bass. After listening to music on the very natural sounding Apple HomePod, which is tuned NOT to sound artificial, these sound a little inflated in the bass, a little synthetic. I get that 's the preference of most people and fits the sound that so many listen to ... but to me it's just a little bit too much 'whooomp whoomp' when compared to the easy-going HomePod. You can literally wear them for hours they are so comfortable. Time will tell if that super comfy padding will last without wearing out - I have some doubts but we'll see.

Soon after receiving the product, discovered an annoying issue: a loud static burst that seemed to be triggered by any slight jarring - generated, for example, by stepping off a curb or firmly shutting a truck door while in the cab. Contacted AnkerDirect via email. * [See 'P.S.' below] Received a prompt reply with suggestions about how to correct the problem. I was skeptical, but tried the ""Troubleshooting Tips"" anyway. To my surprise, the procedures worked! In about 5 minutes, I was able to eliminate this bluetooth-related problem. No more irritating static bursts! In case it might help someone else who encounters a similar problem, the troubleshooting tips I got from Anker: 1. ""Forget"" the headphones in your device's Bluetooth history. {""Unpair"" on my Android phone} 2. Reset the headphones by holding down the Power button and Volume+ button together for 5 seconds while the headphones are charging. {Suspect this procedure is what ""did the trick""} 3. Try pairing it with another device. 4. Try the headphones in bluetooth mode and wired mode and see any difference. 5. Try the headphones with NC on and off and see any difference. If troubleshooting does not fix the problem, we're more than glad to help you out per our warranty. Of course it's possible that this problem could come back. However, the problem is so completely gone now that I'm pretty sure it could be fixed by simply repeating one or more of these procedures. One remaining minor issue for me: can't get the play/pause & volume controls to consistently work while listening to audio books. Will update this review later if I'm able to solve this. Hope this is useful. *P.S. Description of the problem that I sent to AnkerDirect support in mid-February, 2020: ""This product is *mostly* acceptable for my needs. However, there's one intermittent problem that makes me think this particular unit might be DEFECTIVE -- a very loud burst of static sound that occurs every time I close the door of a truck while in the cab. (Note: I regularly drive several different trucks during my volunteer work, and this annoying phenomenon has occurred on each truck I've driven so far.) This same brief static blast (like a small explosion) also consistently occurs when I do a particular qigong exercise - one of the 8 pieces of brocade - the one where one rises on one's toes for a few seconds then drops to the floor... even when the floor is carpeted.

I am pushing music from tidal in master quality and it sounds great. With the noise-canceling enabled, the bass is dialed back a bit (quite noticeable between off and on). However, they have a bass booster that is almost a bit much with the noise-canceling disabled, but really help restore the lows when you have the noise-canceling enabled. That being said, for 55$ shipped, it's hard to justify not grabbing these. I had been considering the bose or the sony's for months now but I just didn't want to drop that much money on cans right now. I am really impressed with these cans and would definitely buy it again. The bose and sony might be better on some fronts, but to me, they are not 150-250$ better. I bought these to replace my AirPods. Sure AirPods are convenient, especially with Apple products. However, in many situations, the volume was always an issue and the sound was just eh. I'd need to have them at 80-100% in my office and just got tired of putting that much stress on my eardrums. I comfortably have these cans on at around 50% volume and have a much more enjoyable listening experience. I did read that some people found these hot on their ears. There is some truth to that. However, one of the core points of noise cancelation is as airtight of a seal around the ear to prevent noise pollution into the can, at the expense of ventilation. I won't argue that these don't get warm on your ear, but it is one of the tradeoffs. Just some food for thought.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Making the initial connection is easy, however it seems to drop the connection randomly from both devices, even though the devices are within a few feet of each other and in line of sight.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-16,Great sound. Great Features. Great Price.,"These headphones are fantastic for the price. Fit/Build: The fit on them is very comfortable. The ear muffs are super soft and you can wear for long stretches without discomfort. The build is great. They don't feel flimsy at all. They fold easily, the included carrying case has plenty of room for them to fit, and the drawstring makes sure they stay inside. The hinges seem durable as well. I take these everyday in a backpack and have not had any issues or concern. Battery Life/ Bluetooth: The battery is incredible. I listen to these at a high volume, i don't always have ANC on. After all that these lasted well over 30 hours. Typical of Anker and Soundcore they knocked it out of the park in this department. The connection is very strong and clear. I have walked through a room with them on and had no issues at all. Haven't had a dropped connection or anything like that. Sound: Let me start off by saying I am not an Audiophile. These sound exceptional at this price point. The BassUp technology is great if you want that bass bumping. With it off the bass is still very good. The highs come through very well, as long with vocals. The mids are very crisp and clear. The ANC works, when i first turned it on it was like being sucked out of the room. Obviously very loud noises can still be heard, but i definitely think the difference is very clear. Gaming: I originally bought these for gaming. This is my only complaint, and the only place these fall short. With that start the only problems i have had is when trying to use them wireless. When attached to my computer through the 3.mm aux cord the sound is amazing for gaming. If you try to use these wireless through bluetooth, the sounds and profiles are way off. I mainly play FPS. In these kind of games footsteps are important to hear, as well as gunshots. These both come through awful. The footsteps are really hard to hear, the gunshots sound muffled and you cant tell what direction they are coming from. The explosions and voice lines from characters are a little overbearing. I tried to install an Equalizer, i couldn't get the sounds to come through well. I just stuck with wired. Overall these are just fantastic headphones. I would rate them 9/10. I would recommend them to anyone.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-02-17,Way overrated,"These q20 soundcore life anc phones are way overrated - period. I compared them directly to my Tribit xfree tune Bluetooth headphones and the ankers lose in every category. The tribits were on sale for $26 when I bought them around Xmas and the Anker q20 phones were on sale for $40 earlier this month, so both bargain priced. The tribit xfree phones lack anc, so were a bit cheaper than the ankers from the start. First, the ankers are heavier and have all kinds of movement in the ear cups that I find prevents them from staying put on my head or fitting comfortably. The automatic noise canceling on the Anker q20 phones is garbage, literally doesn’t work at all, it actually mutes the bass somewhat, but doesn’t block outside noise at all. The bass up feature on the Anker phone is also terrible, it makes all types of music sound like a 17 year old punk’s car with the bass overwhelming and ruining the music. I left the anc and bass up off features off and the sound from the q20 phones is decent, but not as crisp and clean as it is on the cheaper tribits. The tribits are much lighter, fit more comfortably, and overall sound much more clear and balanced, with deep bass present but not overwhelming like the Anker q20 phones (even with the bass up feature off). Overall, I thought $40 was a great price for anc Bluetooth phones, but the ankers were an utter disappointment even on sale. They just don’t sound that good, bass up button is useless unless you want a headache and the anc button does nothing to block outside noises. Overall I would not recommend the ankers over other cheaper Bluetooth phones.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

If you just leave the set on with just the noise canceling turned on, you will get an overall dampening of the surrounding noise, but it was not completely cancel it out. This is good in office environments where there is often a lot of ambient noise. In louder settings, like airplanes or traffic noise, a set amount of that still penetrates the headphones. If you turn on music, that tends to overpower whatever outside noise may come through. As for the quality of sound, it is best when the NC function is turned on. At this level, music is clear with a decent level of bass. The overall sound quality is equivalent to sets easily costing three times as much as these and you would need to try a $200+ model for better sound. Overall the headset is comfortable to wear for extended periods of times, but your ears can get warm after about 30-40 minutes. It also seems that if you have a smaller head, that these may be too large; so the model is not recommended for children because it will keep sliding on their head. The same may be said for some women. The only feature that does not seem to work well is the microphone. It does not matter if you use the unit wired or as Bluetooth, the microphone does not capture your voice well. I have tried it with my phone and with digital conference calls through the computer, and in both situations, users complained that they could not hear me well.

The fact that these $40-60 headphones even compare to these headphones that cost $100-$300 more shows what a ridiculous deal these are.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-02-19,"Noise cancelling off, and needs eq settings","Q20’s are well reasonable for their price Audio is not crystal clear but no noticeable static except on bass heavy songs but pretty good quality. Eq option could probably fix this though, if they added it. Sound is not as controlled as Sony but those are also higher priced. There’s a problem when Noise cancelling is on and you move really fast, theres a loud pop which is super annoying and audio becomes slightly muddy when NC is on, so you have to choose between clearer quality or noise canceling, but you can leave it off always because even though grip is not tight, it still blocks out most of the sound. I would prefer more anc so I will wait for thier next new version of their “space anc” or vortex which hopefully they fix the muddy and static on this when NC is on and fix the static bop noise when moving fast with NC on (such as turning head fast) . Also when laying on side with NC on, it thumps or purrs like a cat for some reason, it is built into it. It has 40 hour battery, so less worry about having to charge it, and it’s mostly on my head. I also like how it goes super low sound and still plays like background music with NC off. Lastly, good build quality, feels durable, a little plasticy and doesn’t feel premium but I’ll take that for better sound/durability in this Price range. I would prefer a lower price with no NC on this model (passive) so maybe q10s atm until the new model of space anc or vortex comes out which should be comparable to the taotronics bh055 based on my speculation even though I’ve never tried any those mentioned headphones here at the end",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

If I were to every compare it to premium brands (as noted by many) it's more on line with the Beats and Bose that cater to heavier base spectrum.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-02-21,Pretty nice headphones for a really nice price,"I bought these on a whim because I wanted to be able to listen to my stereo and play guitar without bothering my downstairs neighbor, and I'm really glad I did. While I haven't yet figured out how to play from my receiver to these headphones, I use them with my phone and they've performed well beyond my expectations. As a real world example of how well these work, I'm sitting at my home office desk which is well within earshot of both my dishwasher and washing machine, both of which are running as I write this. I'm listening to my phone and I can't hear either of those two appliances with the headphones on, but when I pull them away from my ears I can hear both roaring away. Oddly, I'm not even 100% sure I was aware of the fact that these were noise canceling headphones when I bought them; I just really like Anker products (as I look at three pairs of Anker Soundbuds Slim+ and an Anker Soundcore 2 speaker sitting on my desk in front of me) and for the price I figured I'd pick up a pair of these, too. For what it's worth I got these when they went on sale, but even for $60 I guarantee these are worth the money. Now if I can figure out how to broadcast sound from my home theater receiver to these things then in addition to being happy myself I know my downstairs neighbor will be REALLY happy too. UDPATE: Okay, after living with these headphones for a few weeks now I've got to do a quick follow-up to my initial review to explain a shortcoming I've noticed in the interim, which has reduced my rating from the initial ""oh these are awesome"" 5-star rating to a more reasonable ""these are okay"" 3-star rating. Basically, they seem to make a pulsating type of low-pitched thumping noise while trying to cancel certain types of noise. It's not exactly loud per se, but it's definitely noticeable and annoying. I typically put these on when I'm running the dishwasher while working from home, and it gets to the point where I'd rather hear the dishwasher than the thumping noise. I also noticed a pretty noticeable lag when I tried to play guitar on Rocksmith 2014 through my PS4, into my receiver, then out to these using a Bluetooth transmitter, but in all fairness it's hard to know exactly where to place the blame for the lag because there are so many pieces of electronic equipment between the source and my ears in this setup. SECOND UPDATE: As of today, 3/17/20, I'm doing one final revision to my review based on Anker's tenacious approach to customer service. They noticed that I reduced my original rating from five to three start and have since sent me no fewer than three emails offering to do everything from send me a new pair of headphones to allowing me to exchange these headphones for another of their products. While I'm not taking them up on their offer if for no other reason than I'm satisfied with the headphones for the price I paid, their active engagement with me post-sale does say a lot about why I'm so loyal to this brand. By and large they make good products at a great price, and when a customer indicates otherwise they try hard to rectify the issue.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These are great. Years ago I received, for free, a pair of Beats Studio Wireless headphones. Flash forward to now, and I am so happy to replace those beats with these Q20s. I was lucky with the beats in that I didn't have to pay for them, but I always realized if I had, I would have regretted that purchase. I never felt they were worth the price. I never felt the sound quality delivered. It's a new era though, and I needed some new headphones. I really like these. I like the price especially. They aren't the best headphones I've ever slapped onto my head, but at this price point I think they're a great deal, worthy of a 5 star review. These will eventually break. they'll degrade. The plastic will crack. I mean, it's the way it goes. The sound quality, the nose reduction, the battery life, and the price. Those aspects all make it worth it though, and when it comes time to replace them, the price point is much more easy to digest. I use my headphones a lot. Every day. And they come off my head, go back on, tons. So they get a lot of use, a lot of stress. I've been frustrated in the past at paying some of the higher price points for headphones, when they break often enough to annoy me when it comes time to foot the bill to replace them. I was spoiled by the quality of sound though. With those Beats, it broke me. I look at what they charge, and what you get. And no.

I'm pleased with them when working at my desk. But if you are moving around much e.g. walking, they make a mechanical noise as they twist slightly- apparently due to the flexing between the headband and the ear pieces as your body moves. Also, it doesn't take too much creativity to figure out a better way to design the controls on the right ear piece. Of course you can't see the controls while you are wearing the headphones - they are behind your right ear. It would have been better to design them so it is easier to feel which control is which.

This is the only Bluetooth headphone I have that does this, and if you search 'disconnect' in the reviews vs. competitors, you will see that the Q20 has issues. If you don't mind your headphone disconnecting in the middle of conference calls or watching videos, read on. I have the Q20, TT-BH085, and $300 Sony WH-1000XM2. Obviously the Sonys are the best hands down. Noise canceling: If the Sony is a 10, Q20 is a 8, and BH085 is a 4. Pretty amazing value. The Q20 has a low hiss while the BH085 has a high pitched hiss. Comfort: The Q20 has bigger and more comfortable ear cups than the BH085, but the Sony's you don't sweat as much and the cups are way softer. The Q20 is made for bigger heads and the BH085 is not.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-02-27,Excellent value in noise cancelling headphones,"I bought a pair of Soundcore Life Q20's since I work in an extremely noisy test lab full of high-performance computer servers with roaring fans. I considered spending the $300+ for top-of-the-line NC headphones from Sony or Bose to protect my hearing. Before I did that, though, I decided that these $50 (with $10 off coupon) headphones were worth a shot. I already had a pair of Sony XBR950N1's and they worked ok to blunt the fan roar, but the NC always annoyed me because it produced an audible hiss when enabled. I'm glad I gave the Q20's a shot. I'm sure that they can't compete with the top-line models from Sony and Bose, but they are a tiny fraction of the price. They compare very favorably with my XBR950N1's, which cost over $200 when new. The NC on the Q20's is definitely better than my old Sony's, without the nasty hiss, but still quite effective in a very challenging server fan noise environment. I would say that my Sony's are maybe _slightly_ better at reproducing music, as the Q20's are a bit too bassy (even with the bass boost turned off....with the bass boost on they sound ridiculous in most cases). I haven't noticed any ""ear suck"" with the Q20's, either. Plus, they are pretty light and comfortable.

Out of the box, the bass is too punchy and artificial, but a simple EQ app dials everything in quite nicely. The NC works very well for low frequencies and provides for a good soundstage in loud environments (airplane, coffee shop). If you're looking for a truly immersive musical experience go ahead and spend $300+ on a pair of headphones.

With the volume all the way up it actually tickles my ears and they actually get just a hair too loud to listen to at full blast with most music so I actually have to listen to them a few notches below full volume !

What I can say is that these do sound good - as long as you don't use the Bass Up! feature. The noise cancellation gets rid of the noise of my refrigerator, a loud fan in the next room, most of the noise of a vacuum cleaner, and a good deal of mid-range to upper bass sounds. To be honest the difference is huge in most settings. I use them for telephone meetings since my AirPods started to run down much too quickly. Caveats - minuses: Not USB C A medium ""thump"" when turning them on as the noise cancellation turns on. It's a lot like the thump you'd hear in a car with a separate sub and amplifier without a pop circuit - just much quieter. There seems to be some sort of noise when I join a call. People frequently ask ""Are you ok?!?"" They compare it to dropping something huge, falling down the stairs, or a large animal moving rapidly through the room. It's brief, however, so their psychological and aural trauma is hopefully minimized. No case. And with a case it's a huge chunk of real estate in a backpack. Pros: I think they pair as fast or faster than my 1st generation AirPods. Inexpensive - and well worth the price for what you're getting. Sound quality is unexpectedly good. I'm not going to lie - I'm hard of hearing and have hearing loss in several spectra depending on the ear - just ask my wife. I'm not able to boast that I'm an audiophile any longer because I spent too many years working as a ""board operator"" (disc jockey) in radio wearing headphones turned up too loud. They sound better than many many many headphones in their price range I've listened to. Should you buy them?

I needed a wireless headset as my new phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. My previous over-the-ear wired headset leaked quite a bit of background noise, so I wanted to look into noise-canceling options. I have priced out the well known brands for their wireless and noise canceling offerings, but with prices starting at $180 I didn't want to have something so pricey on my desk at work. And many of them touted ""audiophile"" level sound quality - I didn't want to pay that for something providing background music at work. I came across these when looking into other Anker products on Amazon - Anker is a brand that I've trusted for years for quality cables, USB charging bricks, and some other audio components so I took a chance. I've used them for a couple weeks now and I can't express how impressed I am with them. The noise canceling and audio quality are good for my work environment, but what really impressed me was the fit and feel of the ear pieces and head strap while wearing it. The strap is lightly padded, and the ear cups are deep enough to not press in on my ears, and the inner diameter of the cup itself is ample even for my larger ears. I accidentally left them paired as I was leaving the office and I noticed that they were still connected well over 100' away. I am sure the audio quality would have suffered at that range, but considering these will always be within 20' of the phone that won't be a problem.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-03-10,Quality,"I've been using these Q20s for several months on and off. My favorite place to use them is in an airplane which I am in often. I'm something of a Bluetooth headphone junkie, and can't seem to become satisfied with a specific type, or brand. To be honest, even though I have several over-the-ear Bluetooth headsets, I only find myself only reaching for these kinds late at night or on weekends once in a while. This is when I can be totally alone and not worried about not hearing others in my family (or even work responsibilities which hit me 24/7). I have used and owned four different over the ear headsets that are of generally speaking lesser-known brands ranging in price from $30 to $60 at the time of purchase. I also own, and consider my premier headset, a pair of Skullcandy Crushers. The Crushers even now still cost a little bit more than these Anker's, even though at the time I purchased them they were $150 (easily two years ago now, probably 3). I must say that Anker makes excellent products across the board. I have owned a number of their products even going back to when they were a much lesser-known brand and especially not something you could find in the big box stores like you can now. Anker seems to be consistent in their approach to making quality products, and if it's of interest to you, their packaging and presentation is always excellent. So, on to these headphones – they have excellent overall sound with crisp highs and mid tones. Bass is clean and weighty, but never “punchy” or overly distorted unless you crank it up too high. I would call them very well rounded but are not going to blow you away with bass or volume levels even using their extra-bass feature (IMO). I’ve listened to podcasts, audible books, videos, and a host of different kinds of music and everything has sounded great. Active noise cancellation is great – a feature I’ve used over and over again on flights. Battery life has been excellent so far, and I must admit I’ve never let them run out. I’ve used them for at least 5 hours on a single day without charging and no issues. Phone calls have been fine and the other side has been able to hear me – but my experience is limited in this area. Ear pads and fit on my large head and are extremely comfortable even for several hours at a time. This has not been an issue for me at all, I even find I don’t overly become sweaty with these headsets on - compared to my Crushers. These do not come with a hard case of any kind so keep that in mind if you like to throw things around or over pack electronic items in your bags. Thankfully I haven't had any issues but will be using a hard case soon. They seem relatively durable even though the collapsible nature of them has become quite floppy over time. It’s probably just an annoyance of mine but worth noting. I have used them both wired and with Bluetooth and neither has given me any issue across three different phones and attached to one desktop computer and one laptop. Stylistically, these are very conservative – and that is a good thing because they’re also not tawdry, tacky, or just plain odd like so many “cheaper” headsets. I very much like the finish of the plastic, lettering, and general appearance. You have a ton of choices in this range of price and style of headset. It's really hard to know where you should land. I think these are worth considering if you are not after a very specific element such as heavy bass. If you want a great well-rounded sound that is crisp, clean, and rich, I don't think you can go wrong with these.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

When that didn't work, she immediately sent me a replacement pair and a shipping label to send back the defective pair. I think that Anker did the right thing and honored their warranty. the five stars is for the way Shelly handled this issue - I always felt that she was there live to quickly resolve my issues. Her response was always prompt - not 24 or 48 hours later but within one or two hours. She was professional and prompt in making the determination that the headphones needed to be replaced and made the exchange quickly so that I wouldn't be discomforted",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

However, the issues in this review occurred in a brand new purchase, and consistently enough to be cause for alarm. IMO these issues invalidate the cheap cost of the headphones. Most notably: The volume control dial on the right ear jams regularly. Sometimes it cannot be pushed like a button at all; other times it functions but not very well; other times it is satisfactory. The microphone is absolutely terrible, 1/10. My phone or laptop microphone are lightyears ahead of it in quality and functionality. The sound quality is fine but not exceptional. The noise cancellation blocks out most sound but does nothing for wind or loud/persistent enough background noise. Even the slightest bumps (like in a car or bus) cause loud and painful feedback. This renders it utterly useless for long term travel, which it is recommended for. It will randomly shut off entirely, regardless of battery level or usage. For these reasons (and the fact that I had hoped to use this for a long while), I have to reduce the 2/5 star review to 1/5 stars.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-03-20,"Mostly Excellent, Except Very Loud Pops from ANC","I've had a pair of these now about 6 weeks and have used them on the city streets, subways, buses, on airplanes, and in the office as a conferencing headset. They mostly do a good job, but they do have several glaring faults: 1) ANC produces very loud popping with medium loud environment transient sounds Whenever there is a med-loud short noise (like sound of my front door closing shut), the ANC produces an extremely loud pop. The original environment sounds are short and maybe around 70-75dB, but the popping sound at the ear is easily in excess of 90dB. This is especially bad on buses and subways when they go over the slightest bump. The pop is pretty painful TBH; it is so bad, I have to turn the ANC off. The ANC algorithm could really use a limiter filter to protect against transients like this. 2) ANC does not work when using wired connection On airplanes, they perform well. They lower the droning sound of the engines pretty well; certainly enough to be noticeable and make the flight more pleasant. I've not had a set of Bose QC cans, so can't compare one versus the other. Whenever you want to use the plane's infotainment system though, you have to plug in wired. This is a problem for the ANC, because it does not work when using a wired connection. The ANC only functions when using a BlueTooth connection. I had to choose between entertainment and ANC. 3) So-so performance as a computer-connected headset When I connect to a phone, the headset performs pretty well for calls, regardless of using phone and a soft codec app. I've asked others how I sound, and they all give a positive response and have no issue clearly hearing me. However, if I connect the headset to my laptop for MS Teams, Zoom, or BlueJeans conferencing, I encounter A LOT of problems transmitting my mic audio; no one can understand a thing I say. I always have to switch to my laptop's microphone array to transmit clear mic audio. There is definitely an issue with conformance to the audio driver.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

SURPRISINGLY WONDERFUL PURCHASE WITH GREAT NOISE CANCELLING,"I work from home and we have hard wood floors and a noisy family. The noise that regularly comes into my office is beyond shocking and distracting. I hear everything. Its like they're in my office. I had been considering many options for sound proofing and decided to give the Anker Soundcore Life Q20 a try. I decided to take a chance on these after researching many headphones and the reviews that followed. I was worried that for the price that I would be disappointed, and I am definitely not. The battery life is insane, listed at 40 hours with ANC on 60hrs off, in Bluetooth mode. The paring was simple and took about 5 to 10 sec. For reference I am using Taotronics Bluetooth adapter for my TV to pair them to my television. As far as the sound its good/decent. A little muddy in the mid/high range for my personal taste, but I found the sound to be actually better with the ANC on, which is not common for other brands. As far as the ANC, it will not drown out 100% of the conversations and talking around you but with music or tv on its so very close. I can't hear the fan in my office. I can't hear my keyboard clatter. I can't hear my family and kids yelling and talking in the other room (for the 1st time in years) with the ANC and any sound input turned on. I should have bought these years ago, especially at this price. I would never ever believed this was possible. They are very comfortable, decent quality. Easy to use and adjust performance features with the buttons. I bought these in hopes of gaining tranquility in my home office, especially with home school going on 10 ft away now due to the Corona Virus. I JUST CAN'T SAY ENOUGH HOW GREAT THESE ARE. My kids are literally 10 feet away, I could always hear every single word spoken, and now as long as I have some sound source on, I can't hear a thing. ITS AMAZING. I can't wait to mow the lawn with these babies. I really expected to be disappointed, and have to spend $100's more, but for my needs these are far better than expected. My only disappointment would be in the sound quality from my tv source. The EQ function is not available from my tv, so its not a reflection of this product. There is also a sight buzz when turning the volume up max. Better when adjusting the source up, suspect related to Bluetooth adapter. Plugged directly into sources with the AUX cable all buzzing is gone, but still mid & high end frequency is fair. ANC is great. Again the only room for improvement would be in the mid and high range sound reproduction. Everything is just flat and muddy, but certainty ok at this price point. Where the product impresses me the most is in the ANC, which scored the highest for mid/high range reduction (I.E. People talking /yelling). I would definitely recommend them especially at the price point.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Full ear cover (I have big ears) Solid noise cancellation functionality Long Long battery life Can turn noise canceling on and off No need for an App to control the headphones Strong Bass sound (I like a good thump in my music and these headphones deliver that) Carry case for the headphones Cons: Vinyl fake leather, I wouldn't have minded paying a bit more for leather ear wraps and head cushion (but then again they add that then it's in the Bose competition level) besides that there are very few cons Summary: The Bose Q35 II headphones are better are noise cancelling. I tested both out in the same environment to see the difference. You can there is a difference but only slightly. These SoundCore headphones are probably at an 80% level if the Bose Q35 where the base 100% operating level for comparison.

I barely hear anything, and the only thing that does get through are sudden incredibly loud sounds, which I would want to hear anyhow in case a child was injured. Beyond that, the noise is either blocked outright or reduced to such a level I can easily ignore it. Do you happen to work in a noisy environment with lots of fans or the constant whirring of other machines? Then you definitely need this. The noise cancelling feature works best with noise that is constant. When I activate the noise-cancelling mode, those sounds are completely eliminated. I'm also quite happy with the battery life. The practical battery life in noise-cancelling mode is 20-25 hours per charge. I've not used it at great length in standard mode, but I wouldn't be surprised if it got 35-40 as others have indicated to me. Sound quality is great. Noise cancelling is amazing.

I got to ""medium"" battery on each flight. 2) Bluetooth pairing/connecting - I use these headphones with 2 different laptops, my fire tablet and my phone. The pairing works the first time and connecting to the specific device works every time. 3) Noise Cancellation - I sat in coach for my flights in one of the front rows. You know who they put in the front rows on intl flights? Families. There were kids everywhere! I have never been so happy to have noise cancellation in my life. 4) Sound quality - I am not a speaker-phile (headphone-a-phile?) but I think the sound quality on these headphones is really good. I don't normally write product reviews. It is March and I bought these in October. I was connecting them this morning and it just worked and I thought I should really share my experience with these headphones because they are serious value for your money.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-04-04,Wondering how they work with Fire Tablets and Audio Books?,"I needed a pair of noise cancelling headphones to help reduce the noise I hear while at work. I work for a production company with many machines running throughout the day. They are not loud, easy to converse over if you raise your voice a bit. There are also a couple of radios being used, tuned to different stations. At times, I can hear both above the sounds of the motors and blowers. It takes a little more concentration on my part to keep my focus on the book I'm listening to and do my job. I mostly listen to audio books while I'm working. I have been using ear buds, which are good, but at times I wished I could hear less of what was around me to reduce distractions when things get busy and have better sound quality. Also, ear buds have a tendency to start to fall out of my ears when I'm moving around a lot, further reducing the quality of sound. I ordered these over the weekend and received them midweek, sooner than expected. They were nicely packaged, coming with a soft pouch for storing, a cable to plug them in instead of using Bluetooth if I wanted, a charging cable, and instructions. Syncing them with my Fire tablet was a breeze. My husband and I tested them to see how well the noise cancelling worked. With an audio book on pause, I could almost hear him. With the book playing (volume at 50%), it was very difficult to make out his words. When I tried music, I could hear it more than I liked while the book was paused, but the narrator drowned it out fairly well while keeping the volume at about 50%. I knew it may not reduce the sound of music and voices very much, but I was desperate enough to give them a try anyway. I have worked two days now, using them most of my shift. Here is the breakdown: Comfort: I wear glasses. A couple times I day I need to adjust the cans to reduce the pressure on the ends of the bows. I have had problems in the past with anything over my ears putting pressure on them and my skull leading to headaches. The slight adjustments helped avoid that issue. They are not tight on my head and aren't too heavy to wear all day since I take them off during breaks. They do get a little warm, but not uncomfortably so. Sound quality: What an improvement over ear buds! The narrators' voices are richer with the extra bass and not having to compete with background noise. I have not tried them with music and I have not yet played with the equalizer, the bass set at factory default. Noise cancelling: I was very happy by the end of the first day. With the noise cancelling turned on, I could no longer hear the noise from the machines. Voices and music were muted enough I could ignore them and focus on the narrator. Controls: Once you get used to which can has which buttons, it's easy to use. The left side had the power and noise cancelling buttons. They are distinct in feel so its easy to turn noise cancelling on and off without accidentally turning the headphones off. The right can has the play/pause and volume control buttons. They also are used for the equalizer. The pause button is slightly recessed, making it fairly easy to find. Overall, I am very happy with these headphones. No noise cancelling feature on the market, from what I understand, will totally cancel out background noise. And, where I work, that's probably a good thing. I do need to be able to hear some things. They are well worth the price.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-06,Fantastic for music and work,"I took a shot with these to get a comfortable over-ear headset with a mic clear enough to use for work calls. I'm on them a few hours a day, and my on-ear headset with external mic hurt my ears after an hour or two and some of my calls are 3+ hours. I've used Anker sport headphones, and their charging cables and battery pack and they've all been great, so I knew these would have good battery and sound, but wasn't sure I could get by without a mic like a headset has. Boy am I happy! The mic is perfectly clear for my coworkers, they're amazingly comfortable, and, as I expected, the battery absolutely meets their ""up to"" estimate. I can go 3 or 4 days of calls without recharging them. So, let's talk about bass. The bass-boosting definitely increases the bass, to the point where I had to turn it off for a song that had a lot of bass-drum. However, it's more of a trade-off rather than addition. You lose some of the clarity of the treble and you have to turn the volume up. But the quality of sound doesn't go down, you just need to decide if you want highs or lows. But it's very quick and easy to turn it on and off. But what about noise-cancelling? Now, I've never had noise cancelling before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm both impressed and unimpressed from what I expected. For unimpressed, with it on, external noise doesn't seem any quieter than with it off. But, it does cancel what I would consider ""distortion."" Everything, external and internal, sounds crisp and clear. The most noise-cancelling effect I can tell is that the noise from your body disappears. Imagine putting a sea-shell to your ear and hearing your blood-flow echo through it. Then, you push a button, and it's silenced. That's what it's like. You can kind of hear the flow and vibrations of your body and voice inside the headphones, but with cancellation on there is only external noise. Which means while listening to music or calls, you only hear their voice with no distortion at all. It's honestly fantastic. But, again, if you're looking for these to make the outside world silent, not gonna happen. Comfort? Holy crap. I get headaches from computer screens, so I have these prescription glasses that filter glare and makes it comfortable. I'm on a computer all day, and with my on-ear headset I either had to pick the headset or my glasses. There was too much discomfort to have the glasses under them. With these Ankers however, I can wear both. There is no pressure against my ears, so there's no discomfort there. And the padding is so soft, theres also no noticeable pressure where the frame contacts my head/padding. So, if you're someone with glasses, these will work for you no problem. Probably. Overall, they're everything I nervously hoped for. I know this may seem a bit over the top for headphones, but they've made that big of a difference in my work day.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

QUALITY: 5/5 Initially when I received this product, I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing sound quality as well as noise cancellation features. I must say that I am not much into music but more into podcasts and use it for making calls. I must say that the sound quality is better than my expectations and the mic works pretty well too! I talk to friends as well as join my office meetings and haven't had any issues in this regard. . COMFORT: 3/5 While the headphones are flexible to a degree, they aren't as flexible as other headphones I've seen. It sits over my ears pretty well and my ears do not feel suffocated initially. However, the material isnt the best out there and I visibly saw that my ears got sweaty after using it for a while. This is when the flexibility comes into the fray. The headphones are flexible in such a way that you can not tilt the ear muffs so that they face towards the ear but not exactly cover the ear to give my sweaty ear some kinda relaxation.you can do that by flipping over the headset and switching the sides (Left over right and right over left).I do go to the gym regularly but I really cant see these lasting long in the gym because I do sweat it out a lot in the gym and my indoor experiences with this pair has made me reconsider if I should ever use these in the gym. CONTROL & ACCESSIBILITY: 4/5 I noticed that when I used it on my laptop, it pauses Youtube videos or any media while playing but fails to play it up back again. The buttons are convenient to use. CONNECTIVITY: 2/5 this has been MY BIGGEST PROBLEM to date. I have noticed that if these headphones are connected to 2 devices (laptop & phone), there are connectivity issues every 3 or 4 hours which requires me to reconnect to the device every now and then which is a BIG BIG CON for me. Sometimes, this is also preceded by muffled or shreiky sounds. .

SECOND, they are just as comfortable as the best brands (I have a Bose set for travel and a Turtle Beach for gaming and the if I had my eyes closed and someone else put these on me the ONLY difference is that the material of the earmuffs on my expensive sets is ""gucci AF"", - one is like silky and the other is cashemereish - these ones are leathery) THIRD and last, the battery life, I do t know how they did it, but the battery life on these suckers is better than my other sets, in fact I been charging them here and there out of precaution (I left one of them blasting off at full volume for at least 12hrs with NC extra bass on and used them for another week or so about 2hrs a day - I ended up plugging them because I did not want to drain the battery all the way down and run out of juice mid-use).

Ill start with the good. They are comfortable to wear. The ear cups enclose my entire ear despite seeming small. The battery seems to last long even with everything turned on. The noise canceling is quite good. As others have said it doesnt cancel out higher frequencies but that is acceptable to me and may not even been possible for all I know. Also as others have said, they are quite bass-y, which is fine with me. A couple negatives is that even as moderate volume the sound seems to get crackly in the higher frequencies. Also automatic pairing with bluetooth can be spotty. Sometimes it will connect by itself and others I have to manually make it connect, but once it is the connection is solid. I can walk across the house and still have perfect sound.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NM3RSRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I bought the wireless earbuds for my wife and I was impressed with the sound quality from such a small package. Someone from Anker needs to tell me if these have the same graphene drivers as the earbuds because I just gotta know (I'm geeky like that). I use these for gaming, YouTube and occasional music and I am pleasantly delighted by the sound quality. What's impressed me the most is the spacial effect I'm getting while gaming. I can hear sound transitioning around me while I'm playing and this blows me away. I don't pick up on that via YouTube but listen to the new Tool album and it's there again. I can't speak to the bass boost because I just haven't found a need for it yet. I am particularly amazed at the noise dampening ability of these headphones. If you expect perfection you are looking for the impossible. It took me a while to pick up on just how effective these are. I have a water fountain/bowl (for the cats) that makes a lot of noise when the level is low. I had been gaining for a while and it hit me as soon as I took these off. I also have to take them off when someone is talking to me. Really the only thing I'd like to see on these is a swappable battery. With that said I have every reason to believe that I'll get great battery life. I just don't like the idea that I have to throw away an otherwise great product for something as simple as a battery. In closing I'd buy these all day at $100 but I'm glad I didn't have to.

My main complaints with the headphones are that there have been occasional times that I put them on and suddenly hear loud static that hurts my ears, I'm not sure what causes this. Also, after owning them for three months, the right headphone is noticeably louder than the left.

I ended up finding these, under $50(!) and have been incredibly pleased with the quality of the headphones. The noise canceling feature is really powerful, for even the loudest of background noises. A godsend for ADHD. The battery quality is very good as well, however it does take a while to charge to charge from dead-full battery. I usually do it overnight as it takes a few hours. However, the battery lasts forever - and even with days of constant use, I’ve never had them die on me. The sound quality is relatively mediocre. It’s to be expected for what you’re paying for, and nothing I’d complain about. The Bluetooth feature is easy, and has been compatible with both my iPhone X and MacBook Pro with no issues. If you use these while laying on your side, you do get that loud screech sound some people have mentioned - but I’ve just learned to avoid that. For phone calls and FaceTime the sound can be a little garbly with some echo, but I primarily use this for music and the noise canceling feature.

This audio is great and clear when connected to a phone, PC, and laptop. Not without issues (bottom). Pros: - Very good noise cancelling feature and it is very easy to turn on and off. I often forget that it is noise cancelling. Its just quiet. - Good sound. Not a lot of bass at least to me it doesn't. The sound is clear especially when used for gaming or entertainment purposes. I could really hear what's going on in the scene and area. - Let's me know when battery life is High, Medium, Low. This is great but why not take it a step further by giving a quantitative value - Has decent padding for the crown of the head. (This may change over time) * - Good surrounding the ears. * Cons: - The crown area was tight at first but eventually loosened up and maybe a bit loose for my liking. There have been times when I would quickly move my head and the headphones would slide off. - From my experience the headphones do not turn off on their own when it is disconnected from Bluetooth. My other headphones automatically shuts off after a given time when disconnected from Bluetooth this head set doesn't do that. - Lacks a power indicator to indicate when it is powered on/off/standby mode. There is light to show it is charging. There is a green light when NC is activated but when I turn off the NC feature I can never tell if the headphones are connected or not. NC is on by default. Issues: - There were times when I would have it connected to multiple devices and the headphones would suddenly malfunction and make a very loud screeching noise. It was difficult to turn off the headphones but it eventually stopped either by holding the power button or plugging in the mini usb. - The headphones pulsate A lot when pressed against the ear. - When using the jack with the NC on there is often static.

The noise cancelling works well - I have a pair of Bose that are clearly superior but they cost nearly $400! There are 4 integrated microphones that detect outside noises and ""cancel"" the sounds - it works! Construction is plastic - to be expected in a sub $100 pair of headphones - with that said they feel like they are made rather well. The earphones are rather comfortable - definitely when compared to ""ear buds"" which I find to be uncomfortable. The battery life is EXCELLENT! My son used these for the better part of two days and the battery did not run out! Manufacturer states 40 hours of battery lie with up to 60 hours in ""Standard"" mode - incredible! These are bluetooth - no wire to deal with and they connected to his cell phone effortlessly.

Additionally the headphones came with everything one could need to use them, including an audio chord just in case you forget to plug them in and run the battery too low. Functionally - they worked. I took them out of the box, turned them on, put my surface pro into discovery mode and i was listening to music in a matter of seconds. No pairing issues. I am not an audiophile, but the music seems balanced and the base is adjustable. There are also volume controls on the headphones themselves.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-06,Great sound and exceptionally comfortable. Effective active noise cancellation.,"This is a review of Anker Soundcore Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones I have a fairly good opinion of Anker products so was somewhat optimistic about these headphones. Upon the first listen I was extremely pleased not only with the sound quality and effective noise cancellation, but also the comfort. The cushioned, over the ear pads were very comfortable and cushy. They did a good job of passive noise reduction right off the bat. Turning on the active noise cancellation only improved that. Some noise cancellation headphones have a very noticeable degradation in sound quality when the noise cancellation is engaged, but these maintained a very good sound even when NC was active however the volume was reduced and there was some reduced clarity in the mid & higher frequencies. Speaking of the sound quality, at this price point these have great sound. Listening to ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" by Tommy Emmanuel was wonderful. The clarity of the higher notes was excellent and defined. ""Love Lockdown"" by Kayne West rattled the fillings in my teeth. The bass was pumping but not overwhelming. The left and right ear cups are clearly discernible because of a large ""L"" and ""R"" woven into the fabric inside each ear cup. That's so helpful because it is sometimes very difficult to know which is which. The left ear has the power and noise cancellation buttons. The right ear is where the headphone jack, microUSB port, volume/track buttons are located and in between them is a multi-function button. Quickly pressing the multi-function button pauses play while a longer press activates voice-control of your smartphone. A quick double-press turns bass up or back to normal. I actually found normal bass to be quite sufficient and turning up the bass usually resulted in mushy sound especially with music that already had a lot of bass in it. I rarely use the enhanced bass feature. There are ridges between the buttons that give you good tactile feedback so you know which button you are pushing. As for using these to take and place phone calls, they were OK. People told me that my voice sounded a little digital, but still pretty good. The problem with using these for phone calls is that your ears can't hear you talk as well as you can hear the person talking so it's a little weird to use them that way. But it can be done. Battery life is stellar and I really like that I can use the included wired connection if the battery dies and continue to enjoy the sound of these headphones. Of course, there is no active noise cancellation when using the wired connection with a dead battery. Also included is the microUSB cable for charging the headphones. Although there is no hard carry case for the headphones, a soft vinyl pouch is provided. The lack of a hard travel case is not a huge big deal for me but it would have been nice to have one. These headphones provide a good value and I'd recommend them to others.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-11-07,Not For The Long Run,"Below is my review as of 3.5 months ago. These headphones have now been in use almost daily for all that period but lately, they've begun to fail significantly in battery life. As shortly as two months into use, I noted a battery life falloff. The original 40 hours dropped to maybe 30 when I first noted and then 20. Now the headphones will not accept a full charge anymore and the battery life is less than half of new. My suspicion is that these are powered by NiCads rather than LiO2. Thus my charging them when they weren't fully down set the battery memory up and up. To say I'm disappointed is to put it mildly. My original review: *************************** Executive Summary: These headphones are every bit as good as the manufacturer claims. Battery Life: After a full charge, I used these for a timed 20 hours. At the 20 hour mark, the battery level voice, which sounds on startup, said the battery level was ‘medium’ after having said it was ‘high’ for all the preceding time. Checking the battery level in the control area of the various iDevices I paired these phones with confirmed with a visual indicator of 60%. I’d say the 40-hour battery life is substantiated. Sound Quality: Here’s where things are, to me, most important. It’s clear that these phones are modeled after Bose given the way they fold up (please see the photo) the naming convention and that they have two modes of equalization – normal and heavy bass. Also here’s where the personal opinion comes in to play. I have no interest in reference, unbiased, headphones. I want an equalization which sounds terrific to my ear and I have it here in normal mode. The bass boost mode does boost the bass significantly but at the cost of the phones’ brilliance which is a tradeoff I don’t wish to make. So my subjective evaluation of the phones’ sound quality is that it’s absolutely top-notch and that’s comparing the sound to three Big Name Big Expense headphones. Noise Canceling: It’s better than expected and also superior to the Big Name ones. Most ANC over the ear headphones do a good job with constant noise such as when you’re a passenger in an airplane. These do fine with steady sound but also reduced the noise level to a significant degree in a gym, in my yard with a neighbor’s dog barking and in my home when a family member had the TV turned up too loudly. Clearly the technology here is superior to the old ‘reduce the droning noise’ technology. The ANC does exact a small cost in sound quality. Ergonomics: These are light and comfortable for all-day wear. I should know having worn them for two days as much as I could starting at 5:30A with an hour and a half in the gym evaluating ANC there and then back at my home office for the balance of the day ending at 7P listening to public radio while reading. The ANC on/off as well as the power buttons are easy to use. There’s an English speaking voice to announce ANC on/off as well as bass boost on/off. Curiously, the power on/off signal is a tone instead of a voice. There’s also, untested by me, controls to speak on a phone. I view this as an annoying added complexity to any headphone lacking a mic. Pairing was easy and worked as expected with several iDevices and Android ones. If you choose to use the supplied 3.5mm tether instead of Bluetooth, you can do so with the power switched off. Conclusion: The few trivial drawbacks are vastly outweighed by the superb sound (subjective), comfort and easy to use controls. These phones are an easy five stars for me.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-11-08,BASS BASS BASS BASS BASS,"I love Anker products. Everything I’ve gotten from them has been well-made, attractive, and priced fairly. I really love their Soundcore true wireless in ear monitors, for instance. Which is why I expected slightly better sound from these. But they suffer considerably from over-accentuated, bloated and fuzzy bass. Even with the “bass up” feature turned off, it’s just way too much. Unless you like to listen at quiet volumes, you may find that listening fatigue sets in very quickly because of the pounding your ear drums are getting. Some people like a lot of bass at the expense of the rest of the music, and if that’s you, you’re going to love these. You can use the “bass up” feature to equalize even more bass in so that bass is pretty much all you’ll get. However, at quiet volumes the bass is tamed a little and you can listen for an hour or so without pain. So, because of this problematic sound signature, I won’t be listening to these or adding them to my collection. However, sound preferences are subjective, and you might like a surfeit of bass. What’s not as subjective is the build quality, which like all things Anker, is excellent at this price point. Noise canceling is also on point. I tested it with a commercial coffee grinder and a vacuum cleaner, and in both cases the already excellent physical isolation was augmented considerably by the ANC technology. Also, the Bluetooth pairing and other firmware tasks worked flawlessly. The headphones come with a nice carrying sack (insofar as any sack can be said to be nice), a 3.5mm male to 3.5mm male patch cable (in case you want to skip the Bluetooth part) and a charging cable. The headphones fold a little to make travel easier. You won’t go wrong with the build or the wearing comfort; I’ve dealt with Anker before and they stand behind their products. The only thing problematic here, at least to me, is the ridiculous sound signature. If Anker were to release a version with non-atomic bass, it would be a winner.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

There is a large letter ""L"" and ""R"" on the inside of the headphones. They adjust about an inch on each side. The top and the ear piece are padded and very comfortable. The ear pieces rotate about 90 degrees, and they can be folded in. There is an audio jack, a mini usb port, a volume increase and decrease button, pause button, noise cancelling activation button, and power button. The volume button controls the volume on the device you have it connected to. When you press the volume button, for some reason the media stops for a second then adjusts. When you turn it on, it makes a noise and tells you the status of the battery. The headphones are pretty loud; I was able to hear what was playing clearly while holding the headphones in my hand. The sound is good too, all the bass from my sons came through and sound the same as if I was in a car. The noise cancellation comes on automatically when you turn them on. I feel like when the music is all the way up, it is noise cancelling and I cant even hear myself yelling what (not at the top of my lungs). As I turned the music down, I could begin to hear myself a little more, but I couldn't hear things outside of that (this is with the volume at about 80%). The true test was turning on my tv with my sound bar on (and it's a really good one) and I kept turning it up and didn't hear a thing. I took these headphones off and my tv was blaring, so much so that my sub woofer was vibrating the bed, but I didn't hear a thing.

Frequency response at both ends of the sound spectrum is good, even with the BassUp feature disengaged. Turning this feature on-- for my musical tastes anyway -- has a negative effect with the bass deadening the mid and treble frequencies. It would be news if the sound reproduction was sub-par and in every listening situation, from music to movies and video editing, the sound reproduction is excellent. What sets the Q20 apart is the fantastic Bluetooth and the noise cancellation features. The wireless connection is exceptional, staying connected quite a way from the source where other headsets have failed. Noise cancellation in the Q20 is better than expected, shutting out the world around you when you want it to and with a push of a button, allowing you to be aware of the sounds around you. All the features are easy to engage while using the headset once you have figured out which buttons on the ear cups perform what function.

They're very comfortable and the controls are intuitive and easy to use when you're wearing them. Battery life is good and charge time is pretty quick.

These pair to BT easily and the controls are much easier to use when they're on my head than my Cowins. Most important to me is the ANC, and these are the closest I've found to my current pair in quality of ANC. My only complaint about these, and the reason I can't give them 5 stars, is that they don't come with a case; instead, they come with a cheap bag that will do nothing to protect them as they're smooshed in my carry-on.

For the money they are quite a good value, but they are not as good as higher end models that cost significantly more. I have a Bose and AKG for comparison. Sound Quality – Good for the price. I have some other headphones in the same price point, and it meets or exceeds the sound quality. But those looking for audiophile level of sound quality will be disappointed. Noise Cancelling – Pretty good. Again, not as good as the Bose or AKG but better than some other so-called noise cancelling headphones I’ve tried. The noise cancelling is strong and obvious. Keep in mind its not magic, you still hear stuff, just not as much even with higher end headphones. If the Bose is a 10/10 this is a 8/10. Comfort – Good but not exceptional. The ear cups could be made of a better material for softness and noise reduction. I’ve worn them for hours and they are similar to others, just not quite as good. Controls – One area I’m not thrilled about. The controls are all push and hold, no switch. So to turn it on and off can be a bit of a pain. There is a noise cancel on and off, again push and hold. Volume up and down are normal. There is a center multifunction button that will do different things in different modes. When you turn it on you get a Low/medium/high battery life wisper tone. Newer android OS’s will tell you the battery life % when you connect to Bluetooth. One nit pick is there is not auto off option if you don’t get signal. So if you fall asleep it will continue to run all night. Battery life is good though so its probably not the end of the tunes when you wake up in the morning. The light – One thing I do NOT like about it is the LED On indicator light is really bright. Bright enough that if your laying the dark and you open your eyes your going to see stuff. Too bright. Case – Comes with a little slip bag, not a hard case. Cord – One area that is better than the higher end headphones is that the wired connection. The Bose and AKG use a 2.5mm input. These have a 3.5mm input. Most cables you buy are 3.5mm on both sides. So if you lose your cable its easy to replace vs a special order know what you need thing. Cables are handy when you’re on a flight with in flight movies. Overall this unit is excellent value for the money. Overall its about 80% of the more expensive units but around 1/3 the price. For value that is hard to beat.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-19,"Great sound, noise cancelling works well situationally","When I opened these, I was reminded of my Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones, which our family has used for years, as Anker copied Bose’s headphone folding technique. Hey, if it works… These headphones worked well in several areas. The Bluetooth set up perfectly on the first try, the sound is quite nice, and the headphone’s over the head band has plenty of room for larger heads, while fitting my quite average woman’s head size. The ear pads fit over the ear, but I wish they had been just a bit roomier. While I have small ears, I still felt the oval shape had them pressing against the sides of my ears, which I don’t care for. If the ear pads had been rounder, they would have worked better. I don’t have much use for the bass boost, but I suppose some might, and it seems to work okay. I would definitely leave it off. I liked the sound very much overall. I listen to Korean OSTs a lot, so quite a bit like American pop, with not tons of bass needed, imo. The noise cancelling worked very well to block people talking around me, but didn’t work if someone was playing a video or music too close to me with really clear sound. The noise cancelling seemed to not work at all in those cases. But for listening to music while someone talked around me or regular TV was playing, those seemed to cancel pretty well. So the noise cancelling seems situational in how well it’s going to work. I love the Bluetooth in these, because my Bose headphones are wired, which sometimes irritates the heck out of me when I need to move around. Overall, these are similar headphones for a much smaller price. I don’t know if these will hold up for the many years that my Bose headphones have served various family members through various stages of life/work/usage. But the Anker headphones definitely work enough like the Bose that I find them quite satisfactory. As I am not an audiophile, your mileage may vary. Overall, very pleased with these headphones which will be used mostly to block out people talking. Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

I got these for travel and phone business meetings although music on occasion. The packaging was typical Anker style, high quality neat and a nice experience. I have yet to test and compare the noise cancellation these with my Bose set during a flight. I will update later if notable. The sound quality is great, although a bit heavy on bass, which the younger generation would appreciate. The highs are a bit attenuated for my taste. Would I buy these over the Bose, yes.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-12-13,Good headphones…when they work,"My initial experience with the Soundcore 20 headphones was positive and I'd originally started writing my review as a 4/5 star review for solid headphones with minor issues. As the month has gone on since my initial use of them though, I've found that they are not reliable and have enough issues that I must move my review of them down to 3/5 stars. For reference: I have paired these with an android phone, an older Mac, a relatively newer Mac, and a very new Windows machine. What's Good • Very good sound quality. I sampled several genres of music during my listening throughout the week. I also listen to podcasts pretty regularly. Voice was clear. Bass and balance of sound were both strong and worked well for my preferences. Nothing sounded tinny. I really noticed the sound difference when I switched to other headphones. • The noise cancelling is excellent. Office noise and chatter are significantly diminished, almost completely gone. They also work well for spaces like traveling on trains and public transport. • They fit well and are comfortable on the ears. I have a small head which can make 'big' headphones unwieldy, but these sat well. With headphones like these, I find it is easy for my ears to get sore after extended use. I haven't had that problem. • Long battery life. I charge them up at the beginning of the week, and easily used them for several hours per day for 6 days without needing to charge up. They also charge up quickly (1-2 hours). The headphones let you know when you turn them on what their energy level is, and will give verbal warnings when their battery is almost out. • Bluetooth has a good distance. I am able to move around my house or office area without disconnection. • The headphones alert the user of incoming calls, and call quality sounds good. What's Bad • The bluetooth interaction is very hit and miss with the computers I've paired them with. The biggest issue I've had is bluetooth dropping without warning. Troubleshooting the bluetooth connection had limited success in fixing the issue. Turning the headphones fully on and off again to reconnect did not do anything long-term to fix the issue. This happened the most on the Windows machine, but I have had some issues with the Macs as well. • The headphones did not come with any instructions about troubleshooting bluetooth issues. • Sometimes the headphones randomly turn themselves off, without any clear reason why. • On the older Mac machine, the bluetooth connection seemed to only sort of work, leaving the sound quality bad (However this may be related to the Mac rather than the headphones.) • Do not use these to work out. Heavy up and down movement will cause crackle and snapping that is outright painful to the ear. I've even had this happen when my foot hit hard stepping off a small curb. I can't tell if the sound is the audio itself or the physical headset, but either way, it is not pleasant. What's Medium • Button use. After the first week I found it easy to tap the 'next song button', but I found getting the pause button tricky. The length you have to press for different functions on a button also doesn't always feel instinctive. Summary These are good headphones for office work or needing to concentrate on a project. They do decently for moving around casually, but are not for a very active user. The sound quality and noise cancelling aspects are strong. If the bluetooth frustrations could be worked out, these could easily become a 4/5 or maybe even 5/5 for me.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Tried other headsets, rebooting transmitter, rebooting headset, repairing etc etc. Nothing worked. The other headsets always had two channels but when I tried the Soundcore Life Q20 no right channel.

I'm super-happy with these! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got these, but I'm pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is quite good. The battery life is also good. I generally use if for a few hours at work, and maybe an hour at the gym, then re-charge, and have never run it all the way down. The noise cancelling is interesting. It's not like it blocks out all other sound, but it does dampen it quite a bit, relative to what you're listening to, even at modest sound levels. I like how you can turn the noise cancelling on/off at the press of the button. I have a plane trip coming up and I'm stoked to have these for that trip! One other thing I really like about these headphones is the interface. Most of the headphones I've used have really awkward, counter-intuitive interfaces which require navigating through menus and such just to do simple things like pairing them with your phone. Not these. Just hit a button and it pairs. I didn't even need to crack the instruction booklet it was so intuitive. The only potential negative thing at all with these, is that for something like use at the gym, or jogging or such, these are a bit on the heavy/bulky side.

I've used a few wireless headphones in the past few years, but I haven't used any of the big name high dollar ones so I'm not sure about an exact comparison. However, I feel these could be up for the challenge. So first thing I noticed was the light weight feel of these. They fit well and aren't too noticable, but the light weight didn't mean cheap plastic like some of the others I've used. The head strap material has some flex so they don't feel like you're going to break them putting them on. Also if you have trouble remembering which ear goes which, they have a big L and R on the inside of the muffs. Speaking of the ear muffs, they are extremely comfortable and seal well to keep out noise. The ear muffs and padded head band allow for hours of comfortable wear. Battery life has been excellent and I like how the headphones will audibly tell you charge level when you power on. This is my first set of active noise cancelling headphones and I wonder why I never got a set sooner.

In terms of fit, finish, and feel, it felt very comfortable.

This isn't very helpful when the headset is on. My biggest gripe with this Anker headset isn't with the actual headset but rather that it doesn't come with a carrying case but rather a drawstring bag. Howe disappointing is that? Not very practical when traveling. Even my cheap MPow 059 headset came with a case. Anker being $10 more than the comparable TaoTronics that has a nice case, should have at least came with a case.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-01-25,"Good sound, bad fit and feel.","I'm simple really. These headphones have a good V shaped sound. I looked up the frequency response on rtings.com as well. Bass was soild and treble seems good but not too bright. Middle frequencies didn't seem recessed even with pronounced Bass and highs. I'd say they sounded pretty good for $60. In that group (budget) of over the ear headphones, they sounded above average. But you could tell it wasn't stellar, and that's fine for $60. I was happy with the sound. However, I returned them. Why? It's simple really. 1. Clamp force is weak. Instantly upon putting them on my head I felt a sagging feeling. Weight was hanging down in the ears. This was because the clamp force combined with the dimensions. Slight head movements and they slip around or off your head. I was unable to tighten the head clamp either! It was fully closed so I could not tighten the fit. My head is above average large too! Always has been. So the fit and sizing of the head band is just way to big. Not doable. 2. Within minutes my ears were hot. The memory foam pads are comfy but way to warm. These headphones use actual memory foam. They get hot, just like all memory foam products. Other workable foams are available Anker. Why use something that makes your ears feel like they are in a heater? Not doable. Anker came close with the sound but fit and feel is off. It's a shame really. I'm not willing to put up with B+ sound for a set of headphones that hang heavy on my ears, slip with causual movements and heat up my ears like little heat packs. Three stars is being generous just because they sound decent. But it's kind of embarrassing how the other mistakes were made with the design of these that could have been prevented. I guess that well rounded budget over the ear headphone is still a myth because Anker fulfilled the stereotype here. Not well executed.

I won't say just exactly what they did to rectify my issue with these Q20s (because I don't want people to take advantage of them), but what I will say is that you should feel very safe in trying out ANY product of their, because they sure seem to always have your back if that product doesn't work out for you. I've been customer of theirs for several years now and they've handled whatever issue I've had in exactly the same phenomenal way! I've upped my initial rating for this product to 3 stars just because of Anker's fantastic customer service and I wasn't asked to do this; I was inspired to! My initial 1 star rating is just simply because they didn't work out for my music listening needs; but you may have a completely different experience with them. So I say, give them a try (especially if you like a lot of bass) and if they don't work out for you, Anker is very very likely to have your back on your purchase. Again, wow! What a great company!!! :-) Now, please read my initial review below to help aid you in your decision, but still consider what I have said above. Thank you for your time reading my review and my update! _______________________ I really wanted to like & to keep these headphones because they looked so good but unfortunately, they had some issues that made them not worth keeping. The things that I really liked about them: 1) I really liked the construction of the headphones; the felt like they were very well made, very close to premium quality. 2) I loved the design of them and they look really great on my head. They are beautiful looking headphones! 3) They were really comfortable; my girlfriend has BOSE QC35ii and I couldn't sense ANY comfort differences. 4) Some of the frequency range sounded really good, mostly in the mids and highs area. 5) The buttons were very responsive and they didn't feel cheap at all—on other headphones I tried, they did. The things that I didn't like so much: 1) These things have way way way too much bass and this is just in the normal bass mode. And the bass sounds kind of loose and not well defined. And when you turn on the BassUp feature, well, I really don't know how anyone could listen to music like that in that mode—they become super muddy sounding! Anyway, they have so much bass that I would say that the regular BassUp ""OFF"" mode should be the ""ON"" mode and the ""OFF"" mode should have considerably less bass. I had to go into my Macbook's EQ settings to pick some preset EQ modes to show just how much the bass needed to be turned down (and this is just in the normal BassUp ""OFF"" mode) to get them to sound better. ...SEE PICTURES of needed EQ settings. ***NOTE: iPods and iPhones are NOT easy to access the EQ settings as they are in: Setting>Music>EQ>Then select the EQ Preset you want—no Manual mode on iOS portables. *** 2) Other problems I was having were when I had them connected to my 2011 iPod. They would cause the music to skip or interrupt 1 to 3 times (almost every time) when I would scan through a track to a another section in a song (it would happen after the scanning) or when I would skip forward or backward to another track. I have other Bluetooth devices that this iPod does NOT do that with, including 3 Anker SoundCore Motion Plus speakers—which I really really LOVE, by the way—so the problem isn't my iPod. ***NOTE: I don't know if I just got a faulty headset regarding this issue but I was too afraid to try another headset. *** 3) The other issue I was having is: I was getting this noticeable volume up & down pumping or oscillations in the music whenever the A.N,C. (active noise cancellation) was ""ON""—it would not do this with the A.N.C. in the ""OFF"" position. Anyway, these volume oscillations would occur with nearly every device I would try them with: a 2011 iPod, a 2012 MacBook, a 2016 iPod, and a 2019 iPhone—it would be more noticeable with some songs than with others and also in some sections of songs rather than in other sections. It did not seem to do this with my Android LG phone but I don't use this for music—I very much dislike the Mp3 format due to the smaller files and the lack of any integrated seamless playback feature. Maybe these Anker QC20s work better with Mp3 formats rather than the Apple ACC formats, but who knows. ***NOTE: I don't know if I just got a bad headset regarding this issue but I was too afraid to try another headset. *** 4) The other thing that I didn't not care for was when the fan was blowing on me I could clearly hear amplified wind noise coming through the A.N.C. microphones which are suppose to help the A.N.C cancel out noice, but in this case they were actually accentuating it through headphone speakers. ***NOTE: this issue wasn't completely a deal breaker for me like all the other issues were but I could see how this would be a problem if I was outside using the A.N.C. on a windy day or if I was hot and I needed a fan directly on me. *** I really like most Anker products that I buy: the power banks, portable backup battery chargers for phones, their Bluetooth speakers (several models)...etc. Unfortunately though, these headphones just weren't able to do it for me this time. :-(",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-31,SO Helpful.,"Ordered these for two reasons. First, I wanted to replace a cheap ""tester pair"" (to see if I even liked the concept of rechargeable headphones) that I bought a year ago, which began to show their age after only about 6 months - and second, I adore Anker products. I have their portable battery pack, two of their charging cables, and a double-USB wall port. None of it has ever failed me, and I've been using most of it for a few years now. Anker is legit. Needless to say, I was SUPER excited when I started shopping around for new headphones and realized that Anker was an option (which then became the ONLY option). Right out of the box, the headphones look amazing. Nice finish. Broad headband. Softest ear pads I've ever touched in my entire life. The fit is incredible, like wearing nothing. The controls take a few practice tries to figure out by feel, which I assume is true of most pairs. You'll probably hit the wrong button a few times (I did). But once you get used to where everything is, and how long to press for which command, then it couldn't be easier. And, coming from owning a much cheaper pair, it's SO NICE to be able to skip songs without constantly having my phone in my hand! Tested the noise-canceling feature for the first time while vacuuming. I could still hear the vacuum roaring (I can't imagine ANYTHING would be able to muffle THAT entirely), but instead of the usual abrasive racket, it sounded more like someone was running a hair dryer about two rooms away. I didn't have to turn up my music to a skull-blasting volume in order to hear it, which was a first, and a very welcome one at that. The battery life so far is ridiculous (in a good way). My old pair could only go about three hours without dying. I've used these several times now, and still haven't needed to charge them. It's like I borrowed some kind of luxury headphones from a rich person. Basically, Anker continues to come in clutch, shocking absolutely no one. Buy the headphones. Do it. Stop reading - why are you still reading, I said stop reading - and buy the headphones.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I own dozens of headphones and IEM's, but only a few Bluetooth-enabled models. I wanted a comfortable pair of over-ear phones with great battery life and ANR for early morning and late-night listening that I could wear while cooking or doing chores, and which would do yeoman's duty with podcasts, news, music, and video using my phone and tablet as a source. It also needed to handle phone headset duties. The Anker Soundcore Life Q20 checked every box at a great price! I have a different model Bluetooth headphone that I use as a daily driver for conference call duty, but I like the Anker's better for anything away from my home office desk. Pro - Ease of use; pairing; simple controls. Comfortable. Lightweight. Excellent fit and finish for the money. Long battery life. Great range. (I went outside to skim leaves out of the pool this morning while wearing these and listening to news. I thought my phone was in my pocket, but it was on the kitchen counter about 40 yards away. Didn't even notice as I never lost the connection.) Great sound for the money. Only one BT headphone I own sounds better with music (soundstage, transparency), but those don't fit my large head well and I can't wear them for extended periods. I could wear the Q20's all day long.. ANR is moderate but effective for background hums and white noise. Con- Clamp pressure could be 10% tighter for my taste. Build quality acceptable.

I was attracted to the over-ear design and noise canceling features. In practice, the noise canceling on the Anker headphones work well when you're sitting motionless (in a library, office, etc) - however when in motion (on a plane, in a car, etc) I found it to be poor. The noise filtering while in motion is spotty - sometimes there's still quite a bit of background noise compared to the Sony product...but the biggest problem by far is the BUFFETTING NOISE. In both cars and planes, I consistantly heard a noise similar to when you have wind buffetting through a car (one window rolled down and the others up) projected through the headphone speakers. This is extremely annoying and distracting, and eventually led me to turning the noise canceling off. With it off, the audio quality really isn't anything to write home about, so I will be returning these.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These have equal or better quality than any $150 or less pair I've owned. They're also very comfortable. If it weren't for the heat generated after 40-50 minutes I might be able to wear these all day. Noise cancellation is also surprising in the fact that you don't notice it. When I'm not wearing headphones I love white noise. It lets me ignore the distractions around me, and focus on my work or play. When I am wearing headphones I hate it. As soon as I notice it in a pair of headphones, I start to worry that I've missed something. Either a phone call, or a family member, or just a noise that I might need to hear, all start to weigh on me and I can't help but take the headphones off. With the Anker headphones all I notice is the lack of distractions. It's simply a very light improvement on the around-ear attribute. And I am very happy with it. The only drawback is the fit when laying on your back, and I do not believe that to be worth the loss of a star. But if you like to listen to music as you fall asleep, this might not be the product for you. The top of the headband makes a break for lower altitudes as soon as you tilt back beyond 50 degrees.

They look nice, but are very cheaply built. I can shake my head side to side and hear parts in the right ear cup moving around. I realize these are budget headphones, but I have another pair that I bought from another brand for the same price and the quality was much higher on the other brand. Also like others mentioned they are very loose on the head, I have a fairly large head and these were loose on me on the smallest fit level fully closed. The ""multi function"" button is also a terrible design flaw, they should have just dedicated buttons for the main functions not one button and try to make it work for multiple functions. The sound is good not great, the noise cancellation from what I can tell is adequate for this price point. I did buy a 3 yr extended warranty on these based on reviews of this model breaking a lot, will update my review after some months to see how it has held up. This is not a main pair of headphones I will be using daily, but for occasional use it may work. I would pass on purchasing these again. Thanks Update 03/29 Anker reached out to me and offered to send a replacement pair to me. I received the replacement pair, and while it did not work out for me as far as what I was looking for, their customer service was outstanding in trying to make it right.

Anker,Soundcore Life Q20,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-03-16,Nice budget headphones with great features hampered by some bugs,"First off, the feature set on these is really good IMO. They have BT 5.0 with awesome range, advanced codec support, multi-pairing, two equalization settings (ie. normal and bass-up), do not squeak, have good fit, and sound fine for phone calls. Heck, Sony's top-of-the line ~$300 1000mx3's have more limitations than this headset (Older BT 4.x, no multi-pairing, poor microphone performance). The headphones sound decent in normal mode albeit I found the soundstage to be rather tight. When using bass-up however, the bass turns muddy and the midrange takes a hit. They went a little too far with it I think. The headphones also sound different with ANC on and off, and when being used wired vs wireless. The headphones are plenty comfortable for fit, but my ears get crazy-hot if I'm not using them motionless. Definitely won't be able to mow the lawn or exercise with these w/o a stream of sweat pouring out of the earcups. Regarding those bugs: The headphones sometimes make a LOUD static noise. This noise is usually related to either putting them on or toggling ANC. The second issue is if you have them too close to something (ex: a pillow if you're using them while in bed), the ANC will go into a positive feedback loop and will create an uncomfortable beating noise until you move them away from whatever object they were near. I haven't tried using them on a plane but I'm thinking this will be an issue there also. Other notes: They still use microUSB, which to me is not a big deal but it would have been nicer if it was USB-C. The silver color will make you look like a Cyberman - so get the black unless you like that look. Overall, I think they are a good value for the money but I'm not sure if I can live with the hot ears, static noises, and crazy ANC. Hoping that Anker will fix the bugs and release and updated version. They love to put ""updated"" next to the listing titles on these budget brands so here's their chance!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I was looking for something to else block out noise in my house. I have EXTRA sensitive hearing, and I live in a new build neighborhood with lots of construction near a major roadway. I often work from home during the week (and yes this was before the COVID-19 pandemic) when I'm working on writing tasks. It was becoming a major struggle to pay attention to my computer and work with so much distracting background noise including my own barking dogs, who just cannot resist the opportunity to bark at strange noises. When I'm not working outside sounds don't bother me quite as much, but something about working just amplifies sound. Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised in the past month with how well these headphones have been able to block outside noises while I do work and keep a steady charge. There are few things that are probably worth noting. 1) These don't have the best sound quality in the world. Yes, it is still pretty good sound quality all things considered, but I do have other headphones and ear buds that provide a better overall sound quality. I use these headphones mostly to play soothing rain and babbling brook sounds while I write. 2) This has really good active noise cancelling all things considered. I can't compare it to Bose or other more expensive brands and options, but it does what I need it to do. Deep bass noises are minimized but not completely eliminated. Higher frequency sounds are pretty much gone. 3) The passive noise cancelling isn't bad either. Even if I don't have the active noise cancelling on the headphones still cup my hears even to drown out most outside noises.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07X3ZBYRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Started malfunctioning within 1-2 months.,"I bought these headphones because of numerous good reviews I had read and how much I like Anker as a brand. However, I have to say I'm severely disappointed with these headphones. I'll keep it brief: Pros: + The sound quality is good for the price point Cons: + The biggest ""con"", and a non-starter honestly, is that the headphones make an unbearably loud static sound several times per hour when Noise Cancellation is on. It's painful to the point that you would visibly / involuntarily grimace every time it happened. If you're wearing these headphones in public or at work, this is clearly not something you want. (Nor is having to turn off Noise Cancellation, given that was a key feature I was looking for.) + The second ""con"" is that volume control is difficult. The headphones apparently have their own volume ""dial"", which is separate from that of your Mac, iphone, etc. (Versus all other headphones I've had, which control your device's volume itself.) So essentially, with these headphones, you have two volume dials to worry about, which can be a hassle for a number of reasons. Would probably have tolerated this, but con #1 made the decision easy. Anker is a solid brand and I don't plan to shy away from their other products, but I would recommend staying away from these.

So, feel free to take this review with a grain of salt. I’ve the last two evenings, I have listened to quit a bit of different music in many genres. Overall these sound great! Sometimes I feel there might be something missing in richness in the middle. Still, it is a minor thing. Vocal clarity is excellent, the bass boost is as good as can be expected from40mm divers. Very happy with this purchase. Today I had my wife try them out while I was at work. She and previously owned an early generation of Bose BT headphones that she gave away for being too bulky for her. She particularly likes Bose products too. When I asked her thoughts on these. She liked them, and mentioned that she listened to an audiobook on her iPad and had great range in the house. So, I had to look at that tonight. We have 2660 sq/ft 2 story house, and when connected to my laptop on the bed of the master bedroom upstairs, there was no place in the house where signal cutout.
