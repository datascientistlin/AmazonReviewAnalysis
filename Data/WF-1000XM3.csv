Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-07-31,"4.5 Stars - Great, but not perfect","I've had these headphones in my possession for a couple days, and I have to say they live up to my expectations. I was looking at getting a WH-1000XM3 (the full-sized headphones) to use in my office, where I have both noisy neighbors and a loud HVAC system to deal with, but when I saw these come up for pre-order I thought they might work better for my use case (aka, not on an airplane). So far, here's the pros: Battery life is directly on the mark with what's advertised. I used it in my office with noise cancelling on, volume at mid-levels from 11-5 before the left earphone actually died. The right still had 20% - maybe using the touch controls for playback a lot causes quicker battery drain? Along with battery levels, charging from the case also seems on the mark. After the earbuds died, I threw them in the case and left for a quick walk. 20 minutes later, my right earbud went from 20%->100%, and the left from 0%->70%. Excellent imo, this more or less means I can just recharge my earbuds whenever I have a brief conversation with a coworker and never have to worry about the battery dying on me. Music quality is great. These sound excellent on the ""Excited"" EQ preset to me, and I rotate through all kinds of genres, from (electronic) hardcore, 80s city pop, 00's nu and death metal, pop and R&B and rap. The noise cancelling - honestly, on a first wear, I was slightly disappointed. I had read the pre-release reviews about how great it was, but when I started to use it out the box, I could still hear people talking to me. Really, these won't block out loud/direct conversations, but that doesn't diminish their usefulness. It completely eliminates the fairly loud HVAC noise in my office, and makes mouse clicks/non-mechanical keyboard usage fade out. And that's without music playing. Once you add music to the mix, these really do block out the world really effectively, even on low volumes. I actually had a coworker today try to get my attention for a minute, of which I noticed nothing, before they resorted to a loud knock on my desk, which I actually thought was a part of the ambient soundtrack I was listening to at first. Very impressed with the noise cancelling when combined with music, and even on its own with my tempered expectations. They're not earplugs, but they're pretty darn close. A quick note: Using full noise cancelling when walking outside results in some annoying wind noise, but there's a preset called ""wind noise"" one step below full noise cancelling in the app that will completely kill that wind noise and still block other noises very well. Connectivity is great. No issues connecting it to my TV, computer, Android phone, or iPad. Protip: Hold the touch sensitive button on both ears for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode for connecting to a computer or non-Android/IOS device easily. The cons (aka, why I'm saying 4.5 stars): No wireless charging. It's a shame with the bulky case, and would make things way more convenient. No volume controls/option for volume controls. Having to open use my device to change volume all the time is kind of more annoying than I originally thought it would be. No way to quickly change noise cancelling modes without the app. Those last two points are fairly understandable given the small(ish) size of the buds, but still would have been nice. The ambient pass-through mode does work perfectly once you enable it in the app though. Overall, I really like these things and I'm super satisfied with the risk I took ordering them before reviews came out. If you're on the fence, I'd buy these. I'll update this review in the future if I have any other complaints/issues, but I'm honestly really happy with these. EDIT 8-12-19: Two weeks have passed since I wrote this and I have a couple updates. One, you actually can quickly change the noise cancelling level by setting one of the touch controls to ""ambient sound control"" in the app. This lets you toggle between a couple different noise cancelling modes with a tap. I've also started to use the adaptive sound control option, which I've found to be pretty accurate and useful. I have mine set up so it's in full noise cancelling when I'm sitting still, wind noise reduction when walking, ambient sound level 10 when running and full noise cancelling when on transportation. I've only really tested the first two options since I don't run nor commute by public transit, but the app switches modes pretty quickly and it's convenient when I decide to go for a quick walk while working. I've also noticed that every so often I do lose sync between sounds/video when connected to my tv, but it often fixes itself pretty quickly, or a pause-play will fix it as well. I haven't noticed it on my phone, so it's likely a mix of distance and the Bluetooth chipset on the TV.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-07-31,My Ideal Kind of Wireless Earbuds,"The following is my first impression after receiving them in the mail today and WOW I am ecstatic. I currently have the first generation AirPods, the overhead WH-1000XM3s and now these earbud WF-1000XM3s. I really liked the convenience and the decent sound quality of the AirPods but unfortunately didn't like how easy it was to hear my surroundings, especially while lifting in the gym, and had to raise the volume so high. The build quality is excellent. The case overall is a sturdy plastic with a nice matte feel and is light weight which will be great for travel despite being bigger than the AirPods case. There are individual LED indicators on each earbud and on the case itself to allow you to know when its charging. I also like the flat, glossy circle on each earbud and how they are touch sensitive so I can use that to control the music as well as the noise cancelling features. Another thing I appreciate is how they give you 6 additional sets of earbud tips in order to allow you to find your perfect, personal fit. In terms of looks, I find it to be a classy look. It definitely doesn't look bulky, (like an oversized bug sitting in your ear) and it feels light weight, being overall comfortable. However, I do have some big ears that stick out like open car doors so your own experience may vary from mine. The fit of the AirPods never bothered me either but it would after a few hours. In terms of sound quality and noise cancelling, I find it to be excellent. My music library consists of mostly hip hop/lo-fi music and these have great bass without being overly ""boomy"" nor too tight. There is definitely a punch you will feel greater than the AirPods. I'm no audiophile with knowledge of mids and highs but I do think they are great for the average listener with a bass preference. To top it off, they are noise cancelling (!) and I find them to work surprisingly well blocking ambient noise. In comparison to the WH-1000XM3s, of course it is definitely not as precise, the noise cancelling is noticeably better and the sound stage on those headphones is large/more open. However, given the obvious size difference in consideration, these earbuds are a delight. In summary, I think these will end up replacing my AirPods. I liked those but I love these for its noise cancelling (which will be perfect for lifting in the gym), greater bass and overall sound quality along with its style. However, for enjoying a full listening experience while not actively moving or traveling, I will stick to my overhead WH-1000XM3s.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-08-02,Sony did it!,"Sony's reputation comes through in this offering of the WF-1000XM3! Wow, the sound I expected would be fantastic, better than my three other over-ear and in-ear sets except Sennheiser, but the noise cancelling is amazing for a product so light and mobile as this. Now the noise cancelling is augmented with the seal of in-ear, but riding in a car / crowded bus, and walk just take you away from everything. As to the design, I love the form factor which allows for gesture support to navigate through ambient noise levels for hearing those around you, as well as audio playback volume and start / stop. I had the Bragi Dash a few years ago and that surface area to perform gestures on those is what made be fall for the Sony WF-1000XM3s and I was not disappointed. Further the look with both black and silver (more like a manila or tan) as not as dorky looking as AirPods. Apple could have done AirPods in black to alievete the dork factor, but apparently choose not to. The Sony WF-1000XM3 buds have the same well machined feel typical of other Sony products. They magnetically snap into their respective left / right bezel in the charging case and the case charges with USB-C. I look forward to a QI charging case, but that's just being a bit picky on my part. Another update I'd love to see is a water resistant set with official IP rating; again nitpicky on my part. Overall, these pair of ear buds changed everything in a very unexpected way for me. I sold off my pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones as well as my Bose QuiteComfort 35 IIs.

Weird Noise cancelling issue,"I wasn't expecting to like these as much as I do because all I really care about is sound quality. When I heard these did not support Sony's own LDAC higher-res Bluetooth codec, and also did not support any of the APTX codecs, I was concerned that the sound would be limited and that nosie cancelling would cut into the bass and midrange frequency responses. I was totally wrong. I have had them over a week, and have not picked up my Galaxy Buds or Bragi Dash Pros ( which, three years on, are still the standard bearer for full featured true wireless buds) or even my 1More Quad driver wired earbuds since. The reason is simple: they sound damned good. They are better, by far, than any other true wireless earbuds, including the Sennheisers, the Jaybirds, and the new 1More true wireless buds. They have plenty of bass, but don't dump it on you like so many cheaper or lifestyle/branding phones (Beats, etc.). With these, the bass notes are still musical notes, not just vibrating punches in the head. The sound stage is open and airy, even competing with some of the better wired earphones like the 1More Quad driver buds. There is an ease and sweetness to the output that make it easy to listen for hours and that no other true wireless buds have. Cons: - no wireless charging; - the case is too big - they protrude from the ear more than the Galaxy Buds or Bragi Dash Pros. You can't lie down on your side with these in your ear - everyone says battery life is 5-6 hours. So far, I am maybe getting 4 - Adaptive Sound Control is pretty useless. Turn it off. - Significant wind noise ADDED when noise cancelling is turned on I set mine to maximum noise cancelling, which blocks out virtually everything, opening the sound stage even more. But a weird issue has arisen. On this setting (with ambient sound control turned off), I get some very noticeable wind noise. If I cycle through taps, first turning noise cancelling off and ambient sound on, and and then tap again so that ambient sound control is off, I hear ZERO wind noise. I hear a little bit more general background noise, but zero wind. if I tap to ""noise cancelling"" again, the overall sound deadens, but wind noise starts to come through. I assume this is because with noise cancelling on, the buds microphones are listening to outside sound so that the buds software can cancel it. But the software is not fast enough to catch wind? Weird. My solution is to set the buds to ambient sound control off instead of noise cancelling if I am in any breezy/windy environment. But if your primary concern is sound quality, buy these now.

I purchased in order to compare to my Airpods 2nd gen; there are plenty of editorial write-ups online done by pros that cover all the granular details but here are a few notes I think worth sharing: - Paired, Airpods (2nd gen) are a fraction of a second faster to connect than the Sonys when it comes to playback - Sony Headphones app used to control XM3 features and settings is a bit slow to connect to the XM3s (8-10 secs). Pay off is customizable equalizer and sound cancellation that are unavailable with Airpods - Sound quality of XM3 microphone is average. Sony's chip cannot compete with Apple on the sensitivity to decibel levels -- the Airpods are able to record (and playback) whispered conversations whereas the XM3 mic simply does not pick up on low decibel audio activity. I used the iOS voice memo app and checked the frequency activity and could can tell right how much more effective the Airpods were. That said if you project your voice enough for everyone to hear in an average sized room then the XM3 will be fine but anything that is considered soft will annoy you like the coworker of yours on a conference call that is 15 feet away from speakerphone. In summary I'm a bit conflicted -- I wanted something that can be optimized for work and play but unless I'm willing to own both pairs, I'm going to have to lean towards the Airpods for now; nothing is more irritating than being misheard or inaudible during a call. My recommendation is if you travel or commute quite a bit and need the sound cancellation then go with the Sonys and just remember to speak up. Soft talkers should look elsewhere.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The noise cancellation and audio quality was outstanding. The reviews on voice quality were mixed but I planned to give it a few more tests. Unfortunately, the left ear bud stopped receiving audio after just a few hours of use. Looking online, there are several identical incidents. I went through normal troubleshooting including removing and repairing and several complete factory resets. No luck. Returning to Amazon but unfortunately more than a week away from receiving a replacement. EDITED: I received the replacement and am happier but they are still not close to perfect. The audio quality is outstanding and if you are purchasing them only for music, go for it. The microphone is poor, so if you plan to use them for calls, plan on having people annoyed on the other end of the line. Unlike Airpods, voice dictation or anything requiring character recognition on an IVR is impossible. For example, the American Airlines IVR could not detect my birthday or frequently flyer number using these while it was no problem with Airpods. They also randomly drop calls much more than they should (or much more than any reasonable person would expect). Again, the noise cancellation and music audio quality is solid. The microphone is poor. Also, the app is poorly developed with a terrible UI and limited functionality.

The multi-function touch pads for each side for easy music, sound variations, cell phone, and Google Assistant pairing. As far as sound it comes down to preference. Obviously wireless buds have improved but for these being Sony the sound is more smooth and crisp rather than loud and bass. I like to FEEL the music so I favor loud and bass, especially when working out. If that’s you I’d suggest going sign Dre’s or Bose. I maxed out the loudness and bass yet it still doesn’t feel right. The Noise Canceling does work and there is an Ambient Sound function. The box says it can be paired with Google Assistant which o didn’t try. Too bad it doesn’t work with Siri like it’s other competitors so that’s another con in my book. The touch pads are very sensitive which is good when needed to control music especially when exercising.

Crushes AirPods.,"I've had the opportunity to sample some of the latest True Wireless products and over-ear headphones currently on the market. Suffice to say, when I had the opportunity to review the new WF-1000MX3, I took it. The charging case featured a silky, back neoprene finish with an elegant copper lid. The texture of the black plastic finish and copper accents on the headphones were tasteful and understated. The opening of the lid was smooth, and the lights on the case indicating the charge status were quite helpful. Putting the headphones in my ear were a piece of cake; all I had to do was insert the foam tip and slightly twist the headphones counter-clockwise until they were comfortably secure. Pairing the XM3s to my iPhone X was a simple task. But the sound; the sound blew me away immediately. After owning Apple AirPods for over half a year, as well as trying the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless and Bose headphones, I was totally shocked at how much better the sound was and how Sony could pack so many features into a such a portable product. The new noise cancelling chip completely eliminated the chatter surrounding me while the driver brought the concert to my ears!

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-07,Amazing headphones marred by difficult interface,"So I got the Sony WF-1000MX3 buds with active noise canceling, and as a long-time Bragi Dash Pro user keeping an eye out for a replacement when these inevitably die, I have comments. My use case is mainly walking 8 miles a day to, in, and home from LA's Runyon Canyon to maintain my 300+ lb weight loss. The active noise canceling is *amazing*. I walk a lot on busy city streets, and they reduce traffic noise considerably. The ambient passthrough is good, but the Bragi system is better - I can converse with people with the Bragis on, but not really the Sony's. The user interface and controls are a mess. In particular: The app is confusingly laid out and takes a noticeable pause to connect to the bids when loaded. About the same as the Bragi app. A lot of space is given to a system that attempts to auto-configure ambient sound options based on location and activity, and was the first thing I turned off. The ANC/ambient sound settings are really screwy - There's a single toggle that turns the whole system on or off, and a slider below that slides from noise canceling to ambient pass-through at one of 20 levels. However toggling the system from the bud control always puts ambient passthrough at the highest level. There's a toggle for sound quality vs connection quality. Selecting the former puts up a confusing alert that says if you prioritize sound quality, you may not be able to go back to the other option, but I've been able switch back and forth. Connection has been pretty solid even on the high quality option. There's another toggle for what seems to be some kind of interpolative oversampling but that is just labeled ""DSEE HX"" without any explanation. Sony makes the same mistake as Jabra in their audio-passthrough option - activating it *mutes* not pauses. This means if you're listening to a podcast, you must remember to pause first or spend a minute finding your place again. Seriously, this is the one thing that Bragi got right that no one else has. The most important thing is to be able to quickly hear the outside world as needed and get back to my listening, and no one has it better than Bragi. The buds use a touch-sensitive button on each one as the only physical control. Right bud is 1 tap pause, 2 tap FF, 3 taps Rew. Left button is tap to advance ANC/Ambient/Off, and hold to temporarily turn on ambient sound and mute (not pause!) playback. The buttons respond slowly, and multi-tap control inputs only give one feedback beep for multiple taps. I'm lucky that as I walk I have the phone handy in a holster that permits me to adjust volume and activate Siri from the phone without removing it, but otherwise no volume control. The press and hold to hear control is awkward to hold for more than a second - you're literally holding a hand to your ear as long as you need to hear, and it activates slowly like all the controls. Also there's not a lot of physical feedback that you're hitting the right spot on the bud. You get used to it, but at first it's terribly frustrating to tap, wait, and then realize you missed. The case is large but much better than the terrible Bragi arrangement. The buds sit down into the case immediately, and there's a hinged cover instead of the awful, heavy, and opens from the wrong side aluminum slide. I miss the 4D motion interface - as annoying as it can be when it activates accidentally, it's handy when my hands are full. Overall the sound is slightly inferior to the Bragis when it's quiet out. There's a good soundstage, but bass is a little muddy. But when it's loud out and the ANC kicks in, it's like you're alone with the music. I find them a little tiring in the ears for long walks. They are much bigger and heavier than the Bragis, even the 65ts, and between the weight and the deep placement required for the ANC to work, it's hard to wear them continuously for hours as I do the Bragis. When the ANC is on, there's a mild feeling of pressure that's hard to describe but is occasionally uncomfortable. The lack of stated water/sweat resistance is scary. I walk rain or shine, and I'll keep the Bragis for the wet days, but I do sweat a little as I walk and I try to keep them free of it. There are points of ingress for water on the buds, and I just don't know how durable they'll be. Phone conversations are reasonably good - my test is my hearing-impaired father, and he can hear and understand me even outside, unlike the Bragis. I'm keeping them, and they'll be part of the mix for daily wear, but it's not the Holy Grail for me of one headset to rule them all. I have been carrying the Bragis, the 65ts for when the Bragis need a charge (I'm getting about 2-3 hours out of mine now) and the AirPods for when I need to talk to someone on the phone. It might switch to just the Sony and Bragi. My recommendation for most people is still the Elite 65t with really good tips. I'd love to hear comments from other users who've taken the plunge.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-07,Sony’s Latest Earbuds vs. The Elephant in the Room!,"So many of us have eagerly awaited Sony’s latest top-of-the-line noise-canceling earbuds. They’re here at last. But what do we all truly want to know?? Ahem! How do the WF-1000XM3 measure up to Apple Airpods? Read on for a long detailed analysis. Quick spoiler answer: Very well indeed, and maybe even better! SOUND QUALITY I personally place the far highest priority on listening quality. The Sony sound is more dynamic, fuller, and truly excellent compared with the also high quality Apple Airpods. These are par with the even more expensive Bang & Olufen Beoplay and Sennheiser Momentums. In the $200 price range, these Sony’s are the sound fidelity new champ and MUCH better than the just ok last generation. When you first try them, if the sound is not immediately blowing you away, you may have a temporary fit issue. Sony supplies a very generous number of different and comfortable tip sizes. Once you nail the fit, they will truly impress in all aspects of sound quality: accuracy, tonal range, non-fatiguing, and punchy (but not annoying) base. If it’s better mic quality you are after, or have hearing difficulty, the Airpods are a bit better, capturing more-subtle voice tones. However, the Sony noise cancellation feature can be left on, or turned off, during phone calls. This is a great option so you are comfortable hearing during a call. NOISE CANCELLATION Apple currently has none. Sony wins this battle because the Apple noise cancelling version, tentatively known as Airpods 3, is not likely to launch until late 2019 at the earliest. If you haven’t experienced noise cancellation in headphones, or earbuds, you’ll likely be as blown away as I was. I got my first noise cancelation Bose headphones six years ago when they were the only game in town. Life changing, truly. A must for any noisy environment and a godsend for rest on long airplane trips. These are my first noise cancelling earbuds and the result is spectacular. I urge you to audition this feature. It alone makes the Sony’s win the battle versus Apple Airpods. LOOKS AND PRESTIGE This depends on what type of person you are. Apple Airpods were considered rare and prestigious gems just a few years ago. Now they are seen as everyday mundane. These Sony’s are a new look: somewhat more understated due to the slick black color. Personally, I like the Sony’s better because they blend. They are still pretty noticeable, though. All things considered, notice your face, not odd mini chopsticks sticking out. This of course is highly subjective. For me, I’ll always take best sound quality as first priority. BATTERY LIFE Simply stated, Sony battery life is good so if you’ve been concerned this is an issue, don’t be. Sony states eight hours of life after a fast charge, or six hours with noise cancelling on. So far, this seems accurate to me. I have not run a longer detailed comparison yet but will update this review as needed. The Sony’s do not offer wireless charging. The highest end version of the Aipods has it as an optional feature at an additional $40. CASE QUALITY Sony gets the nod here, as long as you don’t mind a very slightly bigger case. The case design is all new and very cool looking indeed. Even more important, it disappears just fine in pocket. SWEAT RESISTANCE This is not Sony’s strength. If you drench ‘em in the gym, I’d stick with Airpods. VALUE AND OVERALL BEST CHOICE Since the Sony’s are still new, the price is not yet creeping down and is quite a bit more than the venerable Apple Airpods. Although only released in December 2016, the “age” of the Airpod technology is showing. Head to head against even the just released 2nd generation Airpods, Sony wins on its noise cancellation ability alone. Beyond that, music is noticeably better, too. Although the 2nd generation Airpods came out in March 2019, improvements are merely incremental. If you’ve just gotta have Airpods, my suggestion is to wait until late 2019 or early 2020 when Apple’s 3rd generation will be much improved. Thus, if you can wait, audition Airpods 3 against the Sony’s and compare the noise cancellation. I trust that Apple’s version will be excellent. Expect the price to be at least as high as these Sony WF-1000XM3, though. If you need earbuds now, not only is Sony the new Sheriff in town. At this price point, the WF-1000XM3 earbuds are the best sounding, too. Thanks for slogging through this long review. Hope it has been of some help.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-07,Best true wireless right now but no support for multiple devices,"Overall I really like these. Sony gets a lot right with their headphones now, especially the foam/silicone ear buds, battery life and sound quality. The case is a little big but that's understandable given the size of the earpieces and the battery. That all said, the noise cancellation works pretty well but mostly on lower frequencies and it's not as successful (or maybe just not as aggressive) on higher frequency noises. I've only used them on a train so far, but it's good enough to cancel most of the noise from a commuter train. In a subway station though, it lets through most of the noise of passing trains. My biggest complaint is how terrible these are when trying to use them with multiple devices. I want to be able to switch between my Android phone and tablet but all that happens is they'll just fall back to connecting to my phone. For example, I can disconnect from my phone by tapping the NFC area on the case. Then I'll go to the tablet and connect and it'll work for about 15 seconds. But then it'll just fall back to connecting to the phone. Bose seems to be the only company that has figured out how to connect to multiple devices. Oh yeah, and I wish companies provided a way to turn off the flashing blue lights. To end on a positive note, the sound quality is excellent so far.

It never turned on again, what a joke.","Review from August 26, 2019 I love these earphones sound so much that this is the only reason why I am holding on to it. Because there are so many connection problems that it makes me hate it like once per hour of my daily use! This is my second pair, the first one I had to return to the BestBuy (just from not knowing how to reset the left or right ear). Now I know how to reset it, because I have to do it twice or three times daily. If I play a song then I press pause and do my thing.....3 to 5 minutes later I want to resume my music. I press play on my right ear and it doesn't respond, I press left ear and it responds with turning on or off the noise-cancelling that's all. I press and hold both ears nothing works, I can not find or connect the right ear to resume music play. Only one thing works I have to take them off and put it in the case. Then once in the case, I see the red light on left ear and nothing on the right ear. So, I do the reset by holding on to the right ear (in this case) then the right ear comes back after holding it for like 20 seconds. Later the same thing, I play music then I need to talk to someone, I press pause, maybe 2 or 3 min later I want to resume music my both ears not responding. I can press both ears and hold for 20 seconds, nothing works until I take it out of my ears and put it back to my case then do reset by holding on the the ear that doesn't have the red light. Don't you guys think this is highly inconvenient that the earphones can NOT stay connected to the device for more than a few minutes when I don't play music? Common, I have Jaybird X3 & X4, Jabra Evolve 75, Bose QC35II and all can be resumed playing music after the small pause of few minutes. Next, today is my 12th day having these earphones (second pair) and the blue light on the earphones started blinking when in ears. It used to only blink blue when I remove the earphones from my ears then it blinks for a few seconds. Now, it blinks blue being in my ears, first right side one blink then left side one blink. I can totally live with this but not disconnection problems. Third problem is connectivity, my cellphone is Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and I have a regular thin clear TPU case, when I turn on the earphones and put my cellphone in the right pocket on my shorts when I walk and turn my head left my left ear starting to cut off music, when I turn my head right my right ear cuts off. I tried removing the case and it was better but still, when I walk fast I feel my left and right ears cut off once in 30 seconds. I tried to change from music quality to the stable connection in the app but it didn't solve the problem. Last but not least the issue that everyone knows about, my wf-1000xm3 doesn't work with my SurfaceBook 2 (marvel Bluetooth adapter). I am waiting for the Sony's update late August. Hopefully, this will work. What do you think guys? Is this pair is also a dud? Should I return this one too? I am just getting so frustrated with this earphones, I have never had to struggle so much with the earphones. I can live with the blinking blue light, I can live without Windows 10 connectivity BUT I can not live with the earphones can not be discovered if I have 2 min break between songs this is ridiculous. Sometimes I just put them in my ears to have quiet environment without any music, as I do on my QC35II and the Sony works for 5 minutes then dies I am trying to press any botos to maybe wake it up but it's gone, I have to look for the case in my backpack, place it in the case then reset then turn on reconnecting place in my ears and 10 min later it will be the same story again. Help anyone, I have no idea what to do with this damn wf-1000xm3 earphones. Review from August 08, 2019 I see that it isn't only me with such issue. There is another couple of people with the same issue on bestbuy reviews. It is the same story as mine, they also have left earbud bricked within first 24 hours of use. Also, this is one of really huge minuses for me, if you use your own ser of eartips from other earphones that fit perfectly fine on this earbuds you will have issue with the case, it wont close! Dear sony, how hard was is to make some kind of clip that keeps the case from opening? So, you can only use the eartips that came with this earbuds. Another one minus for me, there is absolutely NO WAY OF KNOWING how charged is the case, is it 100% or almost dead nothing on it. Another draw back there is no volume buttons, no power of/on buttons. P.S. I was hoping this will be it...unfortunately this wf-1000xm3 came with way to many minuses and issues. I loved the music quality and a battery life (promised one, not the one I got on my right ear only :)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2019-08-09,Field Tested - Not ready and its worth $50,"I had very high hopes for this Sony iteration. But alas all the favorable reviews by influencers seem to be too good to be true. Sound: First the sound when connected to the phone is excellent. However, that’s where all the favorable accolades end. Noise Cancelling: I couldn’t tell at all if it’s working or not in an office setting. It’s that subtle. Most of the cancellation is coming from sound isolation using the right tips. Well, this can be achieved at a very high level with any ear buds paired with comply tips. If Sony’s selling point over MW07 or kilpsch and sennheiser was noise canceling then I can tell you it’s just a gimmick. The larger 1000MX3 are league ahead of these buds. This changed as I boarded my first flight to MSP. Here once ambient noise was activated, you could hear everything amplified while in noise cancelling mode, I could really tell the amount of noise cancelling. I was ready to change my review this happened on my next flight. To compare, I brought my MPOW true wireless with AptX with me. Both were equipped with Comply tips so sound isolation would be equal in both. I first tried the MPOW and they did an amazing job isolating the engine noise. Another advantage was that the sounds was generally higher in MPOW so I didnt need to crank up the decibels on MPOW. Then I placed the Sony and was completely surprised that in Noise cancelling mode, they were WORSE than MPOW. I have no explanation for this. I was very impressed with them on my first flight as the noise cancelling was stellar. What happened? It could be that when compared to MPOW the noise cancelling effect was worse but when tried by itself, it was acceptable. Anyway, the MPOWs are less than $50 and they have better codecs and sound fidelity than Sony. Sony still has punchier and cleaner bass but MPOW is right up there. Connectivity and Controls: its very buggy. It would not connect to my Samsung TV. After a power cycling it did connect but the right earbuds continued to lose sound. The sound was hollowed and not rich like when playing music from phone. I was playing a Dolby 5.1 source so it should have been much richer. The app is another story. It would not show as connected even though my Bluetooth list showed it was connected. I also noticed that sound during calls would randomly cut off and come back even though the phone is right next to me. The Hifiman have 150 Meter range. These don’t even meet their advertised range. Its unforgivable at this price to not have APT x and IPX rating. I get it that they are likely withholding on some features from the first version. However, they left out the wrong features and besides the sound, these earbuds is a work in progress. Battery: This is a deal breaker. The right side was draining much faster then left side. They were at 70% to 95% of left side. This is a real problem on longer flights. You don’t want one side just draining faster than the other. Updating battery usage. Battery with NC does not last the promised 5.5 hours. It lasted 2.5 hours for me. Also, the right side lost battery before the left side Overall I think these require significant firmware upgrade. NC need to get closer to 80% of the 1000MX3 over ear pairs. The battery is a big issue and connectivity needs to be improved. I’ll test these in a flight next week and report back. These are likely going back",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-08-09,"Great sound, good NC, volume issue","So I already own the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1, which I love considering price, performance and just overall goodness. Have owned several pair of TW IEMs, including the $300 Senn Momentum TW (sold them), the first gen Sony TW and a bunch of others, including the Nuheara IQ buds (first gen). Settled on the CAs but also have the Sony full-sized M3s, which I also like a lot. With that as contect, I am a big fan of these Sony TW 2.0 buds. The only two gripes I have are the sound on some, not all, of my tracks is too quiet even when maxing out the slider on my iPhone 8+. I know it's the mastering of the tracks, mainly, and I don't expect ear-shattering sound, too old for that (and it's dangerous). But even with NC on, when out and about I have to skip some tracks, mainly the pre-loudness war tracks (classic rock, some jazz and mellow vocals). Not a deal breaker, but not the best scenario. The other issue is they are not as secure as the CA Melomanias, and sometimes it feel like I am ensuring they are snug way too often. Also not a deal breaker, but I may explore using foamies with these buds. Of course, that brings up the hassle of keeping them in the case without their OEM tips, a plague across almost all TW buds (at leas the ones I have experienced). Bottom line, I am keeping the Sonys (I had a decent credit on my Amazon account, so I paid $130 for them) and my 1-2 TW option, along with the Melomanias. Two different flavors, but both offer excellent, balanced sound, not bass heavy or light, just right. The Sony NC is not quite as good as the full-sized M3s, but 80-85 percent there. Oh, almost forgot. The lack of volume control could be a deal breaker for anyone using these for on the go listening, if you have the same volume issues I have. Constantly changing the volume is not much fun. The other options is creating specific playlists in iTunes to use with the Sonys, so you don't access any tracks that would be deemed too quiet. On that front, moving to a streaming service alleviates the issue somewhat, because streaming (in my case Amazon Music Unlimited) tends to stream every track at identical volume levels. I don't use streaming out and about, but I may do that with the Sonys. I do have unlimited LTE on my mobile plan, which I know means they slow it down once you hit the cap. Anyway, there's this option too. Are the Sonys worth $229? Close call. If I had to choose, I'd take the CA Melomania at $129. But again, both ice cream, just different flavors. Update: I started the return process. Two things are potential deal breakers for me, but I am going to try different tips (Comply foamies? Not sure) before a final decision. As noted, the volume on some of my onboard tracks is woefully quiet, even at max on my iPhone 8+. Also, sadly, the Sonys generate wind noise; I found out on my first dog walk outside with them in use. Not horrible, but if the wind kicks up, it's annoying/distracting. Maybe foam tips will solve both issues, but I doubt it. If not, back they go. I actually think the Cambridge Melomania 1s sound as good if not better than the Sonys, without those two issues. And they are much less obtrusive, don't need an app (use Kaiser Audio player to tweak the highs a bit), are built like tanks and do take Comply tips, once the original foamies that came with them wear out (my preference in tips for these phones). Update #2 Digging into my bag of tips accumulated over the years, I did find a better pair than what comes with the Sonys. Not sure where I got them, but they just work. On the other hand, I have to sort of agree with a reviewer who says after sound quality, which is very good, the NC is just okay (not really like the full-size Sony M3) and I still have to resolve the wind noise issue, which is a deal breaker for me no matter how good these sound. On planes, trains and such, I would always favor the full-size Sonys. So what's the point if the in-ears are going to make wind noise when out walking? None. I can use the Cambridge Audio buds for that job (plus the CAs are sweat proof). So the chances are pretty good I am going to return the Sonys. Sorry to say, they didn't match up to the hype IMHO.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-08-09,Impressive - Some NC Tips - Hot Swappable Bluetooth for multi-device use !,"Overall: I give these a 9 out of 10. I. Noice Cancelling (NC): The NC of these earbuds are nothing short of Absolutely Amazing, bar none! To anyone who says differently, they probably have not taken the time to form a proper seal. Here’s a good way to test for a proper seal: 1. Wear the earbuds, NC set to ON, in a noisy environment. (I used a stretch of highway in a car). 2. See if lightly pushing inward on one (or both) earbuds causes the outside sound to become more quiet. If it gets quieter, you do not have a good fit. Try to form a better seal: push inward, twist, pull outward a tad, whatever ... If you still can not get a proper seal, change to another tip size. You may even find you need different sizes for each ear. I wear the default size in left, and one size up in the right. I think many owners will probably not be enjoying the full NC that these units are capable of. I want to confirm that there is a vast difference in each of the three levels: Ambient Sound: outside sound is passed through with a very slight amplification. Ambient Sound Off: the earplug effect solely from eartips. Noise Cancelling: ambient sound is cancelled to various degrees based on the app setting with an optional checkbox dedicated to pass/not pass the vocal range of frequencies. When fully engaged, all car road noise was completely eliminated; and you experience driving in silence while feeling all the bumps in the road. Wow !!! II. Comfort In testing the battery usage, I wore the earbuds all day at work with NC on. Although, I do not believe these earbuds are AS-COMFORTABLE-AS my Jabra Elite 65t's, they are still fairly comfortable. I did not suffer from discomfort or fatigue after wearing them a little over five hours. UPDATE: I have not worn my Jabra's in over a week now; I decided to use them. Now, I feel it's just a different fit, and I actually feel the Sony's are more comfortable than the Jabra's. III. Battery Usage: (not quite as good as they claim) BLUF: 5.25 hrs. This was with Noice Cancellign ON, DSEE HX on, & Bluetooth focus on Sound Quality vs Connection This may be why my experiences are below other reports where battey usage is right on the mark. The battery readings (on the iOS app anyway) jump in steps: 100%, 70%, 50% and 20%. Both left and right units drain in unison. You can see one unit at 70% and the other change 70% to 50%, but that apparent difference is only shown for 2 mins, and the other unit will drop from 70% to 50% to match. I.e., they ""bump down"" farily close to the same time, but not exactly at same time. I ran with NC on and loud AC unit at work for 3.75 hours before reaching 20% and hearing the first voice prompt to recharge units. Continuing, I achieved 5 1/4 hours of usage before the units gave a second recharge prompt, and then powered themselves off. IV. Have Two Devices? Enjoy ""Hot Swappable"" Bluetooth Connection !!! Hot Swappable BT Connection is a feature that many have missed in reviews. If you plan to connect with multiple devices, this should be important to you. Hot Swappable means you do not have to disconnect from one device (yourself) in order to switch to another device. The earbuds will disconnect from the first device automatically when you connect to a second device. It's fast and reliable! You'll get audio confirmations too: ""Bluetooth disconnected, bluetooth connected."" (This feature works for any device that has ever been connected before. If it's the first time the device has connected, this feature will not work.) A Word on the Blue Blinking Light Thing ... There were some very early on concerns that the blinking blue lights would be annoying at night in comments on you tube - it’s nothing to be concerned about - the lights don’t blink when you’re wearing them - they signal Bluetooth connection and allow you to know when they auto power off if you take them off, and don’t place them in the case. There is an off/on setting to auto power off in 5 mins if they are not being worn, and not in the case. Pros: Outstanding sound signature ! All the detailed items listed above -especially hot swap bluetooth. The touch panels are reliable, ( not my experience with Sennheisers). Cons: Phone quality is good if you’re in a quiet environment; Otherwise, hit and miss - too unreliable at times. No direct volume control from the units themselves (wondering if future firmware will address this) The Sony Connect app (ironically) has to re-connect if you ever switch to another app, blank the screen, or minimize it. The app should be named the Re-Connect app. UPDATE Sept 8, 2019. ANC comparison with overEar ====================================== So I’ve heard how much better over-the-ear headphones are for active noise cancelling. Yesterday, I was passing by a Best Buy, and had these earbuds with me. I wanted to do a head-to-head comparison of these, the WH 1000xm3’s and the Bose 700. I didn’t play any music - just Noise Cancelling comparison. I stayed about 40 mins ... and heard a few different background environments - overhead speaker announcements, conversations of customers, and loud deep base entertainment demos ... I walked away with the following three thoughts: (a) no headphones offer perfect noise cancelling. They all do a fantastic job - but none are perfect. (b) I was disappointed with the over-the-ear headphones not being MUCH MUCH better than these earbuds. If the over-the-ear headphone were better, then it wasn’t by very much at all - it’s not a STARK difference, it’s barely perceivable if at all. (Yeah, I know, I’m going to be accused of being paid by Sony to write this - but this was my experience. I was thinking that if over-the-ear phones were drastically better, I may walk out of the store purchasing the Bose 700 -as those are best for phone calls.) (c) There is absolutely no way in the world that I would buy either the Sony WH 1000xm3, or the Bose 700 over-the-ear headphones - not when these wf 1000xm3’s arepractically keeping up with NC-ing with very little difference, and they’re cheaper, and a lot more convenient. I remain very happy with purchasing these units and my only complaint is phone call quality for the person on the other end. ===== If you found this review helpful, chances are others would too.

Noise cancelling is a fraction (maybe 50% IMO) of the demo Sony over-the-year XM3 model I tried oor the Bose wired version that I am replacing. I used it mostly to listen to podcasts on commuter trains. While the voice still sounds clear, the background train noise is still fairly substantial and the isolation is disappointing, nothing on par to my old Bose (which broke) but certainly better than the $50 Taotronics that I was using as an intermediate gap. On top of that, there are a lesser myraid of connection issues, button not sensitive enough, bluetooth connection with windows, etc. that some other board mentions. All these are minor stuff but the most critical noise cancelling ability is in general a disappointment to me considering this pair sells for $230.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-08-13,Great sound with decent noise canceling,"So I have Sony's newest over ear noise canceling headphone and really love them, except that they are bulky to carry around, mess up my hair in the morning and make my ears sweat in the summer. So when I saw these coming out I rushed to get them. So far I'm only a day in and the sound is great. I've tweaked the settings and found the right size ear piece and now can't be happier with their sound quality. Their size, weird and design are exactly what I wanted. With an additional case I bought on Amazon I can just hook the case to my backpack or pants so don't need to lug them around. Now for noise canceling, like with the over ear you may need to tweak the settings to have a better experience. Some of the defaults let in higher levels or types of sounds you may not want. To be clear though, no matter what setting you use they are not as good as the over ear units for eliminating sounds but are much better than anything else out there in their style. On the train it eliminates the train noise and significantly lowers background chatter. With my music or a book on the outside noise is completely gone. They are not perfect, I wish they were water\sweet proof. I wish they had a volume control. I wish they supported Alexa instead of Google (like the over ear unit).

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-13,Exceptional Noise Cancellation and Sound Quality,"I have numerous noise-cancelling solutions ranging in price from budget to premium, both in earbuds and headphones. The WF-1000XM3s true wireless earbuds are the best amongst the various noise cancelling earbuds I own. It’s important to understand what noise cancelling is and is not. Noise cancelling does not block all ambient noise. It listens for constant background noise (e.g., jet engines, construction, general crowd roar) then issues a counter signal to block out that sound. When I watch You Tubers unbox and test a new noise cancelling product, I often see them switch it on then ask someone in the studio to shout at them, and they then nod understandingly as if this ridiculous test has any bearing on noise-cancelling efficiency. Noise cancelling should also be distinguished from noise isolation, which is what occurs when your ear canal is blocked by a well-seated ear bud tip. That reduction in ambient background noise is caused passively (versus actively) by your ear canal being blocked. When you put your fingers in your ears in anticipation of a loud boom, you are doing the same thing. That said, effective noise cancellation also requires effective noise isolation. The best noise cancellation in the world is meaningless if ambient sound is entering your ear canal around loosely seated noise-cancelling ear tips. I point out these differences because most of my friends and family (and some YouTubers) don’t understand the differences between these two concepts. Now that I have that out of the way, on to the review. In short, the XM3s offer excellent noise cancellation and superb audio quality. The XM3s ship with a very generous number of ear tips. Once I figured out which set offered the best seal and fit within my ear canal to maximize noise isolation, the sound quality was apparent. I despise tinny sounding ear buds. I prefer a deep bass response that is not muddy and doesn’t overwhelm the music. These offer fantastic bass. Sony’s Headphone app offer various profiles, once of which offers a bass boost. Thus far, the bass boost is my favorite. My music is clear, crisp, and has a nice bass emphasis. Call quality is also great. Calls are crystal clear on both ends of the conversation. The noise cancelling is impressive. My favorite noise cancelling headphones are a pair of MW65s. The XM3s offer very comparable noise cancellation at 10% of the size since they are only earbuds. I enjoy being in a noisy environment and cycling from ambient noise to noise cancellation just so I can hear the satisfying “whoosh” of entering a near sound vacuum where the ambient noise is being cancelled out by the XM3’s. The XM3’s have a noise detecting microphone on each earbud. If you choose, you can use the Sony Headphone app to automate the noise cancellation. The app will use the microphones to determine what setting you are in (sitting, running, transport, etc.) and will adjust the noise cancellation automatically. You can further tune it to allow in however much ambient noise you desire. You can even choose for it to isolate and highlight voices so you can hear people who may speak to you. You can also cup your hand over the left earbud to pause everything so you can hear people. I find this very helpful when out and about since I can quickly ask or answer a question without dislodging the earbuds. The XM3s are not waterproof, nor rated for any water resistance as far as I can tell. This is odd since one of the app’s sound profiles is running. Clearly Sony intended these to be used for exercising yet did not make them water or sweat proof. I guess they figured your sweat is unlikely to reach the units themselves since they do sit out a bit from your ear. I use these at my gym so I guess time will tell. The earbuds themselves are bulkier than standard earbuds. Oddly, however, they do not feel heavy at all. I forget they are even there. I also love the charging case. It is magnetized and just sucks the earbuds right into place. It thankfully also uses USB C. The case is kind of bulky, however, and isn’t comfortable in my pant pocket. A purse, backpack, or gym bag is the way to go. My other noise cancelling earbuds are connected with a wire to a unit that rests on the back of my neck (that unit contains the noise cancelling microphones.) The unit on the back of my neck isn’t the end of the world, but if I am moving around a lot (like at the gym) I am constantly having to readjust the neck unit. Being truly wireless, the XM3s are the next step up in convenience and comfort. Overall, these offer great active noise cancelling and sound quality in a smaller footprint than full-size headphones. They are not, however, inexpensive – but at least you’re getting what you pay for. It’s a technological achievement to be able to offer outstanding noise cancellation and audio quality in true wireless earbuds. If you are not put off by the price, I highly recommend them.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-08-14,Underwhelming,"I was so excited about these earbuds because I love my wh-1000xm3's so much. Unfortunately they didn't live up to expectations and I'm returning them. The biggest issue I had with them was comfort. They felt ok at first but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt. I tried all of the included silicone tips and multiple positions but it was always the same. Not sure I can blame the ear buds for that though, as it may have just been a bad fit for my ears. In addition to being uncomfortable, they just didn't feel very secure. Even after ensuring that I had the bud placed all the way into my ear canal with a good seal, they would still wiggle around when I moved and I would have to readjust them every few minutes. I also had an issue the day after I got them where the left ear bud completely died. It wouldn't charge or anything. I found out that this has actually happened to several people and in most cases can be fixed with a hard reset, which worked for me. But I've heard from others that the problem has recurred. Bugs like that are not something you should expect with a price tag like this. Next, the noise canceling. From some of the online reviews it seemed like the noise cancelation was good enough to rival that of the wh-1000xm3's. Not even close. I mean it's still pretty decent for in ear headphones but it's not even in the same stratosphere as the WH's. Besides that, everything else about these was pretty solid. Really good audio quality, fast connectivity, great battery life, classy look. But ultimately I do not believe these ear buds are worth $220. Maybe $150. I've since bought myself a pair of the ""1more stylish true wireless"" ear buds and I much prefer them over the Sony's. Way more comfortable, comparable audio quality and battery life, sweat resistance, and best of all only $100. Jaybird also just released a new pair of true wireless ear buds called ""Vista"" which are apparently fantastic as well so I'd recommend looking into those.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-08-14,I'm not sure why these are getting such negative reviews...,"I'm honestly shocked these are getting bad reviews... EDIT: To those who's left earbud has stopped charging/working. Place the earbud in the case with the right one. Touch and hold the touch sensor for 20 seconds, or untill it starts flashing red. Let go, and it should start taking a charge and reconnect! Syncing was a cinch, between NFC or bluetooth, I'm really struggling to understand how anyone was having issues pairing these with their phones. I have a Note 8 for reference. The range decreases if you switch from quality over connectivity in the Sony app, but if you're working in an office or just around the house with your phone in your pocket, you shouldnt have an issue keeping these set to quality. The sound quality is surprisingly really good! I previously had a paid of Bose quietcomfort, but over the years the wires began to short out, hence the switch. I do feel Bose has these beat for noise cancelling, however if you factor in that these are the first truly wireless earbuds with ANC, these do an amazing job. Plus if you use an ear tip that creates a decent seal, the difference in ANC quality is truly negligible. I've had 0 issues with the left earbud not charging or cutting out or anything. I'm really thinking they may just be a fluke. My only grievances would be the no IP rating, the Sony app itself, no volume controls on the earbuds themselves, and mic quality. The latter three can be fixed with firmware/software updates. And being these just came out not too long ago, I'm willing to bet an update is in the works. Overall these are fantastic.

They are great sounding and the noise canceling is pretty good. I own a pair of Bose QC 35 II headphones and I would say the Sony earbuds sound better to me. However, they are a tad below the QC35 II in terms of noise cancelation. Though they are pretty close and should keep most people happy, especially in such a small, portable form factor. There are many things I like about these wireless earbuds. For one, I like the touch control - left earbuds to adjust noise canceling and right earbuds to play previous/next track. The Sony Connect app has an equalizer to tune the sound to your liking, and various controls to customize your earbuds. The built-in microphone is pretty good. Voice is nice and clear. No problem hearing people speaking to me or hearing me on the other end of the line. The earbuds support google assistant. I don't use it, so I don't know how well it works. The earbuds run for 6 hours on a single charge. I was able to get very close to that. The charging case can recharge the earbuds 3 more times, for a total of 24 hours. The charging case, albeit a little large, is fairly portable and very nice looking. These earbuds are not without issues though. Initially, I couldn't get the left bud to work until I preformed a reset per instructions. Now both buds show up as separate Bluetooth connections on my phone. Secondly, the there is no volume control on the earbuds. You'll have to bust out your phone to adjust the volume. Pretty inconvenient I would say, especially when your music are not normalized to the same level. Thirdly, they are not sweat resistant, so I probably won't use it in the gym. Lastly, the touch control is super sensitive. I found myself inadvertently triggering the touch control while I was re-seating the earbuds in my ears. All in all, these earbuds are great sounding and have good noise cancelation. Despite the issues discussed earlier, I really enjoy them a lot. They are great especially if you're constantly on the move.

If you don't create a good physical seal (like I didn't at first) you still hear the sounds that are going around the noise cancelling. So... STEP 1: Create a complete seal (make sure the tip you choose is big enough) STEP 2: Be amazed how well these suckers work! I was sitting in front of a window air conditioner—a great source for the kind of steady sound that NC headphones eliminate so well—and I could still hear a decent amount of its rumble, even with the noise cancelling turned on, especially in my right ear. Bummer. I was disappointed like a number of other reviewers here. So I started to play with the right earbud, really getting it in there and twisting it upwards as recommended in the instructions. And then...SILENCE. Woah—these things work! As others have said, it's probably 85% - 90% as good as Sony's over ear WH1000M3 headphones, which is a fair tradeoff for me, considering the very useful form factor of these small earbuds. They'll still take away the energy-sapping drone of a jet engine just fine. I have found the foam tips seal off sound a tiny bit better (like 5%), but they take a lot more messing around to get a good seal and they're less comfortable than the silicone ones. So right now, I'm using these with the largest silicone tips, typing in front of an AC on full blast, and it sounds like the equivalent of a small computer fan running across the room. So that's my experience—yours may vary as everyone's ear canals are different. But I'm guessing most anyone (except those with really wide ear canals) can make these things work great as noise-cancelling option that lets you travel light. And as others have noted, these things sound amazing, feel like quality, the app is kinda dumb but useful, the case is biggish but pockatable, the touchpads are touchy, and it's a mild bummer that you can't control the volume directly from the earbuds. Overall, I love these things, even more after I figured out how to make them work.

The controls work well, they surprisingly stay in my ears and they are comfortable. There is one knock for me and that is the battery life seems either a little exaggerated or too optimistic because I’m getting only about 4 hours out of them with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) on but I’m getting much better than that with ANC off. I like the transparency mode for hearing what’s going on around me and the ability for it to figure out what I’m doing and adapt ANC to that is impressive. I wish they had some kind of volume controls on them but it’s not nearly as bothersome as I worried it would be...on a scale of 1-10 concerning how much that bothers me, the answer would be about 1 or 1.5. The earbuds covers are AMAZINGLY comfortable and they provide a very good seal. They also provide a lot of choices for tips. Concerning using these for active activities...I’d hard pass on that because these are not rated to be moisture or waterproof (bummer because at this price point I’d expect that) but careful consideration can keep these going for a long time, I believe. The sound quality is awesome for earbuds. These have punchy, right bass, a firm middle and a very customizable high or low end because of the EQ. The app works well but still isn’t my favorite...but at least it does provide more than just banal settings. The case size is a different shape than I expected (pic shows the case beside a Powerbeats Pro case) and the Sony case is actually more comfortable for me to carry than the other because it is skinnier. Charging is very good and very impressive.

The sound is great, noise cancellation is awesome and these just work consistently and they work well.

It won't be as good as over ear headphones, but still VERY good. Sound quality is decent and the accompanying app gives some EQ that does make a difference. Connectivity is the only quibble.

And other than maybe a little weirdness when pairing both to phone off the bat a few times, haven't had any connectivity issues.

I tried all the tips included with the buds, and the ""spongy"" ones seem to stay in best, but still come out if you're even a little bit active. They're also awful if you plan on wearing them outdoors. The noise cancellation can't handle even the slightest breeze without playing the wind over whatever you're listening to. This can be ""turned off"" and adjusted for wind noise, but has to be done every single time you put the earbuds on; this makes the ability to adjust it basically worthless unless you don't mind opening the app every single time you go outside. On top of this, they lack of any kind of water resistance which means you can't do any outdoor activity without the fear of breaking these very expensive earbuds. On top of the major issues, these buds also use touch-sensitive buttons for media control which make them really frustrating to use. They're super sensitive and easily accidentally activated. I've unpaused my music many times when taking the buds out of my ears. For positives, these buds have a USB-C charging case which is strangely rare among buds available on the market right now so I have to give them points for that. The case is also magnetic so the buds fall into place very well and are super satisfying to place into their case. My only complaints about the case are its size (it's huge) and the lack of simple indication of battery level. I just guess how long it's been since I last charged and plug it in when I think it might be low.

First, the earbuds are very large and heavy, making it difficult to keep them in my ear while I work at my desk. I used the smallest ear tips, but they are still too big for my ears. When I talk, chew, or even make faces, the movement of my jaw, cheeks and ears make the earbuds wiggle out. The longest I can keep them in my ears is 10 minutes WHILE I AM WORKING ON MY AT MY DESK. I also have longer hair which occasionally tug on the earbuds and pull them out. I would never use these anywhere outside due to fear of losing them. The sound quality is just OK. Just OK, but better than most earbuds. The low end/bass is not powerful and I found myself struggling to hear some vocals. The ambient sound is constantly turning on and off when the room fan/air triggers the auto ambient controls. The noise cancelling is not as good as my Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones (wired) and that was just the normal office noise. I'm not even bothering with airplane or outdoor noise. Again, I would not use these on an airplane because they keep falling out (I've seen many Airpods littering airport walkways). I'm glad I got the wired earbuds for travelling. But the thing that really got on my nerves is that they are not compatible with Windows 10. I searched discussion forums, video tutorials and manuals only to discover in buried discussion board that a ""Sony Rep"" promised an update by the end of August 2019 so the earbuds could be used with Windows 10. For nearly $250 I am not wasting any more time waiting on something that may not happen. I plan to use these only at my desk at work and not being able to use it with a Windows PC is a nonstarter. Last night I purchased the Bose Sound Sport Wireless at a local big box electronics store for $179. I paired the earbuds with my Samsung Galaxy immediately without trouble and listened to the that beautiful Bose sound. I paired it with my Windows 10 laptop this morning at work (I had to find a solution on a Bose forum to find the right steps). It paired and it sounds great. It took about 10 minutes from start to finish.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-20,"Great Sound, Good Noice Cancellation, Room for Improvement","3.5 stars, rounded up. I'm coming from the over-ear Sony headphones (the WH1000 something), which have the best noise cancellation out there and an incredibly clear, immersive, and expansive sound stage. These are just a step below in sound quality, but still great. The noise cancellation is good but not great compared to the over-ear headphones. Still, it is night and day compared to Airpods, which of course have no active noise cancellation. The improvement in sound isolation and listening enjoying from having external noise largely cancelled (maybe 75% to 80% of the level of the over-ear headphones) is more than worth the price. FYI, the noise cancellation depends heavily on the earbuds creating a seal. I could not get them to work effectively until I up-sized to the largest tips and performed the little twist after insertion like the instruction video recommends. With past earbuds, I've used middle-sized tips, so it was a surprise that I had to use the largest ones. I did not find the App to be that useful, other than to turn off the adaptive sound control (which does not make a huge difference and requires giving up your location) and turn on the high-definition upscaling (which does noticeably improve the audio). Just set what you want and don't bother with it again. The lack of volume control is an inconvenience. I have not taken out my over-ear headphones or Airpods since getting these. Their size makes them much more convenient than the former for work and travel, and their noise cancellation makes them much better than the latter. UPDATE: Wore these on a 3-hour flight. The noise canceling was good—not great like the over-ear Sony earphones, but good enough to be preferable given the smaller form factor and convenience. However, the battery on the right bud ran out before the end of the flight, while the left bud still had about 20% left.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-08-21,King of Wireless Buds,"I tested the new Sony WF-1000XM3 noise canceling wireless buds for a few weeks by using them in all types of surroundings. I’ll just get this out the way, the sound was far more superior than other wireless buds. The sound and battery life are really a difference maker. The battery lasted about 7-1/2 hours with music and podcast listening. This is on par with some on-ear wireless headphones. Add in the charging case and you can get up to 32 hours' worth of playtime. This is really useful since I work at a desk for 8 hours a day. I'm still adjusting to the adaptive sound control. This is a neat feature in theory, as the buds can tell if you are sitting, standing, running, or riding on a noisy train. The only problem I have is the buds normally are set to standing when I am sitting, then in five minutes the music pauses to change to sitting. I am used of it, and that's nothing a software update can't fix. The Sony noise cancelling wireless buds come jam packed with a host features: Ambient Sound Noise Cancelling USB C Charging Case Dedicated Sony Connect App HD Voice Calling Support Adaptive Sound Control Instant Bluetooth connection As awesome as the Sony buds are, there are a few quirks that I didn’t like so much: The wireless buds are not water resistant. No volume controls on the buds. Touch controls have slow response time. Sony Connect app can be confusing at first usage. The buds overall fit may not be for everyone. May be too expensive for some. Overall Sony did a very good job with the WF-1000XM3 wireless headphones. The Ambient sound feature works just as well as the noise cancellation. With the ambient sound active I can hear people talk around me without the need to take out the buds. I really enjoy the noise cancellation on these pair of buds. The noise cancellation drowns out a good bit of noise, you may notice some degradation in the sound but not much. Music and Podcast sound really good, I have no complaints with clarity, and bass response.

I’ve had products from Beats, Bose, and Apple and nothing even comes close to matching the sound quality of these earbuds. The noise canceling is on par if not slightly better than my first generation Bose QC35’s. The sound stage is incredibly broad with sharp definition for all frequency ranges. I’m no audiophile but even my untrained ear can tell these earbuds are a massive cut above all others in this price range. I simply cannot recommend this product enough. To clarify I’m an iPhone user (iPhone XS running iOS 12.4). At the time of this review I have experienced no problems with the Sony app (which you need to make use of all the features of these bad boys). While these are made to be used with primarily android devices the loss of Siri is not enough of a deterrent for me. If you’re an Apple user and you’re considering the AirPods with the wireless charging case just do yourself a favor and spend the extra $30 for a set of these. I promise you will not be disappointed. These loss of wireless charging is a minor inconvenience for a truly life changing audio experience. AirPods in comparison sound lifeless after spending a session listening to the Sony’s.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-21,What alchemy be this?,"For a few years now, the noise-canceling earbuds of my choice have been the Bose QC20i, which are wired. The noise canceling is excellent, the sound quality... less so. My experience with Bluetooth earbuds has been that sound quality is mediocre, and noise canceling is often very poor. That said, I have been a Sony fan for decades and early reviews of the 1000XM3 were positive, so I thought I'd give these a go. When I first tried them out and played the tracks, from my iPhone X, that I typically use for earbud testing, I was blown away with how freaking GOOD they sounded! Clear, tight bass, unmuddled midrange and crisp treble. I was hearing things in tracks I had not noticed before. And this was with the ""DSEE HX"" sound improvement feature off. Next I tried the noise canceling. Unfortunately, the Sonys arrived just AFTER I returned from a trip with 12-hour flights, but I fired up a white noise machine and had it approximate the sound of a jet airplane in flight. When I activated the canceling, the noise dropped to a bare whisper, at least the equal of the Bose QC20i if not better. By default, the Sonys automatically adjust between noise canceling and ambient sound based on what it thinks you are doing. For the way I use them, I disabled this option and just set it to maximum noise cancellation. These adjustments are done through the Sony Headphones app, but once you set them, they stick. You can also adjust an equalizer in the app if you want and change the function of taps on the buds' control pads. Tapping the left or right bud, once, twice or three times can switch among noise canceling/ambient modes, pause/change tracks, answer/phone calls and more. Tap-and-hold the left bud temporarily switches to ambient so you can hear announcements and the like. Unlike the Bose ambient feature, the Sony made the sound seem natural, if a bit lower in volume. Note that there is no volume control on the earbuds, you'll need to use your device for that. Sony makes a big deal of promoting use of Google Assistant with the 1000XM3, but you can also use Siri and this worked fine. For either, you have to tap and hold the right earbud's pad until the assistant of your choice activates - you can't do a ""Hey Siri"" or ""OK Google"". Phone calls sounded good on both ends. Sony includes four sizes of silicone tips and three sizes of ""comfort"" tips that are a bit stiffer. For me, the silicone tips worked better and, unusually, the small size was best where on most earbuds I take a medium. I found the buds comfortable to wear over long periods, but those looking to wear these during exercise should probably pick something else as they don't claim to be moisture resistant. The earbuds turn on automatically when taken out of the charging case and turn off when returned to the case. If you are playing music, taking one bud out of your ear automatically pauses. You can use just one bud if you want. The buds will run 3-6 hours on a charge, depending on what you're doing, and the case can recharge them three times. A 10-minute charge gets you up to 90 minutes of playtime. The charging case has a USB-C connector - a short A to C cord is included. The case is elegant (black and copper), but I wish Sony had included a soft pouch to keep it in. (I have no doubt third-party pouches will appear.) Is there anything about the 1000XM3 I don't like? I did find myself accidentally tapping the control pads, but I expect that will diminish over time. They do stick out more than the QC20i buds so I would not try sleeping on a plane with these in. I do like that the LEDs stop flashing soon after you put them in your ears. For me, the Sony WF-1000XM3 is a superb set of earbuds and I look forward to using them on my next flight.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These earbuds are OK for NC, but not in the same league as the QC35. They are particularly lacking when it comes to voices, but also have trouble with other types of ambient noise. I've tried them outdoors, office, and on the train. They never really satisfied in any of those environments, but they were useful in the office and on the train. Outdoors I feel they just didn't cut it as they seem very prone to wind noise effects, even in the slightest breeze. I'm not big on their comfort either, but I need to experiment with other size ear buds they provide. With Sony's recent NC headphones being so good I had high hopes for these, but if I had got the chance to try them first I would not have bought them. The User interface is also a mess which doesn't help. I've only had them a week or so, and I'm sure I will use them from time to time, as I can't wear my hat with the QC35, but I'll be watching for more advanced buds if Apple continues to refuse to make AirPods in black. Charger works OK, but manual is a joke. The quick start on the box, is only a quick start for charging and downloading their spy app. When you open the instructions there is a completely different set of quick start instructions (much more useful ones). It seems like they could not make up their mind on who was going to write the quick start guide, so we ended up with 2. There is no information with the earbuds on what their spy app is used for. There is mention of one function of it in the manual, but no mention that the function is part of the app. When you go on-line, many of the help pages are generic and talk about all their headphones together with no indication of which features are supported on which devices. OK so thumbs down on documentation. All my testing was currently done on an iPhone 5SE, as I didn't want to re-pair it if I attached it to my other iPhone or iPad right now. So I think these score 3.5+/5, I gave it 4 stars as there is not much competition.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-22,Almost perfect,"Sony almost defined perfection with these earbuds. They check off nearly all the boxes: Small stylish design for the buds and charger/storage case; decent battery life; and exquisite noise cancellation. The sound quality is among the best I have heard used, with excellent and customizable bass. The mids and highs are equally balanced and clear. I am a real audiophile, and I own just about every pair of high-end earbuds and earphones on the market today. These earbuds easily dominate the current market with two exceptions: 1) noise cancellation; and 2) call clarity. First, the noise cancellation is easily the best for wireless earphones, but it differs from Sony's high-end earphones or other competitor's full earphone (cans). However, in a small form factor some of this is expected. Buds are never going to seal like over-the-ear headphones. The noise cancellation filters out about 90% of background noise, but it is still there. The background noise is most prominent when you are not playing music, so you cannot use these to medicate or tune out background noise; it works best with music to override the remaining background noise. However, one of my favorite features, which I have not found on any other earbud/earphone, is Sony's auto adapt noise cancellation feature. The earbuds listen to outside sound and automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation. For example, the earbuds correctly switched from transit mode while I was on the train to walking when I got off the train. This is a spectacular feature for commuters using different transportation. I had maximum noise cancellation on the train, but when I was in traffic I could hear the cars and nearby noises. The adapt feature works correctly about 98% of the time. The second main area where these earbuds need improvement is their calling feature. The earbuds are unfortunately useless when making a telephone call. While I heard callers loud and clear, people consistently could never hear me – even in quiet rooms. I hope Sony will correct this issue with a firmware update. This lack of telephone clarity prevents these earbuds from being the commuter's ultimate earbuds. Sony did a great job with the phone app, which is rare among even the best audio companies. Often the app is a huge downfall. The app has a variety of custom equalizers, plus the ability to set and customize your own. It expertly controls the features of the earbuds, including the level of noise cancellation and auto adapt function.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2019-08-22,Great fit for my ears -- but that's the only good thing I can come up with.,"These true wireless buds come in a charging battery case featuring a USB-C connector for charging; in case you don't already have USB-C cables handy, the box contains a USB-A to USB-C pigtail. Battery life appears to match the promise of 6 hours play time and total of 24 hours with complementary charging from the case -- comparable to the main competition, Apple's AirPods. The buds are small and are fitted with removable tips, and they come with an assortment of tips of different sizes and types. To wear them you insert them and turn a quarter turn; I find them to be a perfect fit for my ear: they sit comfortably and don't fall no matter what I do, unlike the AirPods which have a hard time staying in my (I assume) oddly shaped ears. Installation, at least on an iPhone, is cumbersome. Not horrible, but a long shot from Apple's incredibly easy one-button process. I assume it's easier using NFC on a Sony phone. At least coming out of the box they enter pairing mode immediately; when I needed to pair them to a new phone I had to google to figure out how to put them in pairing mode -- not obvious. Each bud has one and only one action, triggered by holding the bud by the side and touching the center. The right bud controls play/pause and the left one noise control. Configuration options are limited. Music quality is superb. The buds support AAC, a guarantee of high quality on iOS, AptX for some Android phones, and Sony's own high end codec (if you play music through Sony's app). Unfortunately, this is where the good news end; After a couple of weeks of daily use I have a litany of complaints which make me believe the gushing reviews that have recently popped up in the press have been maybe a little ""sponsored"" by Sony. Problem #1: ANC *sucks*. First, setting up the controls so you can reliably trigger between the various modes using the left control button is amazingly unclear. You often get into a configuration where the bud pings but nothing changes. When you finally turn ANC on, however, you realize it wasn't worth the wait because it is completely ineffective. I fly a lot and it is completely incapable to cancel out engine noise, which is unforgivable considering Sony currently produces the top rated noise cancelling headphones on the market. Problem #2: buds occasionally lose sync, meaning there is a very perceptible delay between the left and right bud. It's unbearable. You can fix it by pausing the music, taking out a bud, putting it back in and restarting the music, but it should never happen. Problem #3: they can't be used for phone calls. The microphone is so bad that when I used them on a call, my friend interrupted me and said literally ""I don't know what you're using but it's awful and I can barely understand you"" -- and I was alone in my house with absolutely no background noise, in ideal conditions. I can only imagine how bad the sound is going to be if you're on the street or in a busy office. Problem #4: controls are cumbersome. You have to hold the sides of the buds and tap. It's easy to miss, and you can also trigger it unvoluntarily when you insert or remove the buds. There's also a smattering of more minor issues that are still aggravating: the voice feedback is sometimes going to a single ear, sometimes both; the case is small enough to fit in a pocket, but it's really massive compared to the diminutive AirPods case. In conclusion: these are earbuds with good audio quality, but they're marred with technical issues that make them impossible to recommend. While it's conceivable most of these issues could be addressed by a firmware update, I doubt fixing the lousy headset microphone performance is one of them. As they are today, I find it impossible to recommend this product.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

For that purpose, its great! Everything becomes really silent. I can concentrate while at work. Also, the audio sound is great. Not much delay, very similar to Apple's earpods. Sound quality is much better than Apple's. For sure. HOWEVER, when it comes to making a bluetooth calls with this Sony WF-1000XM3, it is completely useless. Sound is horrible to the caller. All of my callers will say ""huh? I can't really hear you. What are you saying?"" So I end up disconnecting it and taking my phone (in my case iPhone) which completely defeats the purpose of having a wireless earbuds microphone speakers.... I don't know how SONY decided that this is okay to sell, but it really needs more improvement. For that reason, I gave 3 stars for the sound quality. Oh, another problem is that my WF-1000XM3 does not work with my Windows 10 Laptop. This seems to be pretty common issue as I see many others with same problems. So, if you are looking for simple audio experience with great noise cancellation, this is for you. But if you are planning to make a calls with these, don't buy it.

The Sony spn700s do absolutely nothing compared to these. The NC is not exactly like the over ear XM3s but get shockingly close. It almost feels as if it blocks certain frequencies better than the over ears when using the foam tips that seal the ear canal. Cons: The touch controls aren't as responsive as I'd like them to be.

I was able to pick up someone’s conversation about 20-25 feet away; was odd, yet cool, at the same time - Noise cancellation feature picks up some ambient sounds, such as the whistling of air from air conditioner in a car; wind noise setting hasn’t helped in this case - Not sweat or water proof, which is surprising at this price point - Not aptx Bluetooth, which is also surprising at this price - Using the right earbud touch control pad to pause music ends up shutting off that side. As a result, I have to pull out my phone in order to resume the music ------------------------------------------- I’m definitely not an audiophile when it comes to such products, and I was initially overwhelmed by these earbuds due to its pairing with an app. Coming from cheap $24 Sony wired earbuds to these presented as a learning curve, so I wanted to give it some time before I reviewed. I feel comfortable enough now and believe that I finally have an, so I’ll try and be as clear and detailed for those in a similar position, and in the market. To start off, these are expensive, yes. With a hefty price tag of $228, you can expect the following benefits: noise cancellation, with ambient switch, a charging case that boasts 24 hours of extra charge, and earbuds that claim 90 hours of play time, touch controls on either bud, voice assistance control, adaptive sound control, and ear detection (quick attention) for quick playing. There are far more benefits, but the product description can fill you in on anything that I may have missed. Is this impressive? I vote yes, it is, but how well do they work? Well, considering its price, I’d say it’s a solid 3-3.5 /5 product. Noise cancellation and ambient noise are the main selling point of these earbuds, with the advertisement geared around it as well. Is it industry leading as claimed? Eh... I’m not quite sure. I’ve tested these in several locations: I’ve gone kayaking with them (risky move due to its lack of waterproofing), ringing the doorbell to get the dogs barking, in the car on a road trip, and at a crowded festival. Based off of each situation, I’d say that these can be hit-or-miss. At the food festival I wasn’t able to hear individuals nearby. It did, however, pick up the conversation of people about 20-25 feet away with ambient switched on. It was hilarious, weird, and then annoying. Switching to noise cancellation was a nice treat, and it does work in crowded venues. Now, when it came to using it on a road trip, I had some noise leakage. On ambient, the earbuds picked up the whistling of the A/C wind. It was fairly annoying, so I decided to try noise cancellation. Unfortunately, it did not help at all. The whistling was still prevalent, which was quite the surprise. I tried the “wind setting” in the app and was met with similar results. The charging case, as mentioned earlier, is beautifully designed. It’s simple, eye catching, and effective, albeit delicate when it comes to scratches. It boasts a backup charge of 24 hours, and the top opens and closes with a magnetic latch. A full charge is indicated by an LED indicator (red), with the earbuds also giving off a red glow. Once out of the case, the buds change from red to blue, signifying that they’re in operation. Likewise, the earbuds are aesthetically pleasing, but also finicky when it comes to user control. Each one has touch control options, with the left controlling ambient and noise control, whilst the right allows for pausing, fast forwarding, and rewinding. Unfortunately, none of the buttons allow for volume control, and is done exclusively through the Bluetooth device. Furthermore, I don’t like how sensitive the touch areas are. When I brush my hair behind my ears, any accidental brushing ends up changing the settings or pausing the song. It’s annoying because sometimes I have to pull out of my phone to get the earbuds working again. Hopefully this is a firmware issue, it sometimes not resuming, and I’ll report back if it resolves. I glanced over this earlier, but it’s unfortunate that these are not waterproof earbuds, or sweat proof for that matter. As I do enjoy water activities, such as kayaking, these are not ideal in my situation. I occasionally workout or take the dogs on a run as well, but these are not meant for strenuous activities, so risk of them falling out is high. Walking is fine, but if you’re buying these for workout purposes, perhaps opt for another model. I won’t lie when I say that I was initially thrown off, in a good way, by the packaging. It’s exciting and new, and is clearly built to impress. There are 6 earbud tips that allow one to find their perfect fit, and they feel just as good as the product itself. Unfortunately, while everything is made out of quality material, I can’t say that it’s a good enough reason to justify the price. It suffers from issues here and there, and while some are preference, others are glaring technical problems. Again, I’m curious to see if these are issues that can be fixed through firmware updates. If not, then hopefully it can be improved upon in subsequent productions/models.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-24,UPDATED - Fantastic product!,"Update to review: Have had these a few months now, and the negatives are mounting. First, they are excellent for music playback. But they are useless for cellular phone calls. Not my words, but have had complaints from every person I have tried to talk to using them. Second, as a writer I wear headphones all day at work to keep out unwanted noises and distractions and to focus my mind. Well, they do not lie about the battery life - these are only good for about 3.5 to 4 hours before needing to be recharged. And the '10 minute' quick recharge to get four more hours is questionable at best. Third, while they are light, extended wear does cause some discomfort. I am still happy with them, but I have sent my LG's in for warranty repair. Original review: Very happy with this product. Gave up on the LG Tone HBS-1125 when my second set broke after only 9 months. Performance is actually better than I expected. With the app installed, the sound quality is remarkable. It is also really nice to have an adjustable equalizer, with both presets and programmable options. I did go through the paces of trying each size of earpiece out, and was startled by the extreme differences in both sound and noise canceling performance between them. Operating distance (from phone) is spot on at about 30ft.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-24,Excellent sound but some soreness and software/connectivity issues. Updated review.,"I've only had them a couple days but already (mostly) love them. First off, ear buds will never sound as good as over the ear cups, but they aren't an option for me. Cups give me headaches from the pressure and I'm prone to heat stroke, can't take the added heat/sweat from cups. That said, these come incredibly close and are the best sounding buds I've ever had. Very rich sound covering all ranges. The noise cancelling is really good. You can still hear voices and high notes but even they are muffled. With music or even just white noise at low volume you'll block out everything. I don't mind the look, classier than airpods and fairly sublte (more so than a goofy neckband). They fit snug and never feel like about to fall out. They are also very comfortable while wearing them, I forget they're even there. That said, the moment I take them out I realize just how much pressure they've been putting on my tragus. It downright stings as soon as remove them if wear them for a length of time. Enough so that putting them back in immediately isn't an option, it hurts. That may just be my big ears though. The other cons are the touch controls and connectivity. The touch controls are extremely sensitive and beep at the slightest touch. However, sometimes that's all they do is beep. They don't actually take the intended action like pausing or cycling ANC, just beep to acknowledge your touch. Connectivity leaves me doubting each bud actually connects independently as claimed. The signal is ussually good but I've found that the second bud inserted (tried left first and right first) can have issues. So far noticed the second bud inserted occasionally stuttering. Not a lot, but now and then. Also once so far the second bud inserted just turned off mid song (fully charged). I had to put it back in the case and then back in ear to reconnect. This may be fixable by future software updates. The case feels a little bigger than necessary and wireless charging would have been nice, but not a deal breaker. That said, it still easily fits (male jeans) in a pocket and feels sturdy and lightweight. I'm hoping the functionality issues will be addressed by a software update and they are minor compared to many non updatable cheapo buds. They sound absolutely terrific. So, in the end my only real word of caution besides the price is comfort. You sort of twist them in, so hoping I can find a position that doesn't hurt the tragus of my ear. If you don't have dumbo ears like me and don't mind the high price, go for it, I really want to love these. Update after having them a week - More software issues but better comfort: -I've actually encountered more software issues. They just updated the firmware yesterday which may or may mot be related. Today they suddenly dropped in volume about 50% for no reason and max volume was half what it previously was. I tried putting them back in the case and back in ear and they would not reconnect to my phone. I rebooted my phone and the buds again and regained connectivity but still at half volume and the left bud kept stuttering. I ultimately factory reset the buds and regained volume and connectivity. A pain but I'm still hopefull that as new as this model is Sony just released them before really ready, in beta software, which is what most companies do at this point, and that down the line the software will improve. -I intially found the foam tips a bit more comfortable in my ear canal but was getting real soreness in my tragus (cartilage nub in front of ear). The foam tips are a little less secure feeling so I was drilling them into my ears as deep as I could, rotating them as Sony reccomenfs so the front faces directly forward at a 90 degree angle to your body. I've found that the silicone tips rotated to get them in your canal but not as far, facing downwards a little puts less pressure on the tragus and feels very secury in place. This will vary depending on your ears, but point is I transformed pain to at most mild discomfort after extended use. P.s. I don't normally write such long reviews but for $230 and really high hopes for these, wanted to share real world vs. glowing paid reviews on tech sites. Overall, I do really like these ear buds.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Quickly realized that i was hearing way to much of the noise and pulled out the Bose - immediately experience that magic moment when you push the button and the noise disappears. Even bigger issue is that the connection to the phone is not as good. It wasn't droping very frequently, but enough for me to notice that it is far from stable. Additionally, although a minor inconvenience, but these do not handle the phone notification sounds very well. When an email comes in, one headphone stutters, then the other one. They don't do it simultaneously, which to me was kinda annoying. I understand that someone else may not be as picky, but I'd rather be honest and highlight this - for those who are.

The noise canceling is overall great but not perfect. I have owned a pair of Bose QC1 headphones for over a year and will say the sound quality is superier. Sony provides an app with multiple equilizer settings that i wish my Bose also offered. The only complaint i have so far is the noise canceling. I did not expect it to be as good as over the ear headphones but because its so good and so close to my Bose headphones, it's one thing i can point out as not perfect. I have noticed that some noises actual get magnified when using these. Bugs chirping or large machinery humming seem to be louder when using these. Other than these specific types of noises, the noise canceling is as good as my Bose QC1 headphones. The build quality is overall great. I have one small complaint, the hinge on the case seems flimsy. Im concerned it will break easily with normal use. Outside of that, these have very strong magnets to hold the buds and case lid securely, you wont have to worry about them falling out of the case. Because the magnets are so strong, even if the case lid breaks the earbuds would still be secure in the case. The fit and comfort are also great. They are obviously bigger compared to Apple Airbuds but still very light weight. Sony offers 7 different ear tips so you should be able to find the ones that work best for you. They stay securely in my ears and i have not had to think about them once i start using them. It's actually amazing how Sony fits so much technology in such a small package. Overall these are worth the price. These are way over my expectations and i would recommend these to everyone.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,0,2019-08-27,Very uncomfortable,"Don’t buy these for noise cancelling. I originally Bought these from Best Buy since they were sold out here, tried them out for a few days but ultimately I returned them for a few reasons. First off , they sit way too deep in the ear its ridiculously uncomfortable. Second , the Sony app is probably one of the worst apps out there, it can barley detect and connect to your earbuds, and when it finally does it’s so glitchy. Lastly, in regards to noise canceling , it literally doesn’t cancel anything out, maybe 10% of external noise at best.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-08-27,One of the Best Wireless Buds Out There,"Sony has been in the Audio market for a while (think Walkman) and they know a thing or two about it. Pretty much all major movie and music studios use professional grade Sony headphones for their production purposes. I have owned a bunch of over-the-head Sony headphones as well as In-ear ones and they surely did a good job. When I was presented with an opportunity to use Sony's WF-1000XM3 buds, I didn't hesitate to buy them, because I knew Sony would not disappoint me. First of all, these wireless headphones are pretty comfortable compared to the other brands I own, I would suggest that if you are a new user, please try all the available silicon rubber earbuds provided in the box to fit your ear just right. Pairing these with my phone was also easy, just download the Sony Headphones Connect app and you will be set. Within the app, you will find multiple ways to customize your listening experience. What I like about these headphones is its noise cancelling function that kicks in and automatically detects the environment you are in and adjusts to it: if you are walking or in a noisy transport, it knows exactly what to do. You can also use your select presets or your own custom equalizer to make your music sound even better. I would say the charging case looks really cool and has a nice feel, however it could have been a bit smaller, also the lack of charging it wirelessly is something I would suggest Sony add to its next generation. I would also suggest that Sony include some type of water resistance to the buds as well as a way to turn volume up or down by using the touch pad on the headphones. These are the only improvements I can suggest to make these truly wireless buds even better. I like how these buds reproduce sound, its bass and treble are excellent. Most of all, its battery performance is superb! I went on a camping trip and these buds lasted me on and off for 7 days! I also enjoy using the Google Voice assistant perfectly integrated. All in all, these Sony headphones will be traveling with me a lot, no more dangling cords! With 10 min quick charge for 90 min of play time - one cannot ask for more! I look forward to discover what else Sony has in their pockets for us in the future. These headphones were offered to me at a discounted price for my fair review and testing.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-08-27,Adaptive sound control works great,"These Sony WF-1000XM3 headsets are pretty nice. The adaptive sound controls successfully detected all my movements whether I was standing still or moving around. I was able to set the noise canceling to allow more sounds through the headset as I needed it to be while I was at work and changed the settings to block out more sounds when I was out for walks or I was in noisy environments. I was really impressed with how well the adaptive sound controls worked and they are probably my favorite part of these headsets. In an office environment, they worked great, blocked out all the ambient noises and muffled out a lot of voices as well. When I was out walking, again it blocked out most sounds, except wind noise. Wind noise seemed to be amplified with these on, but I'm guessing the wind was able to enter my ear from a lack of a good seal from the headset since the noise sounded a lot like what I hear when riding a motorcycle and the wind entering the helmet. Sounded a lot like a wind tunnel in my ears. These are a little bulkier and heavier than some of my other wireless bluetooth headsets, but they weren't too bad really, but that might be a reason I had a little issue with the fit. A few times the headset fell out of my ears when I just looked down or if i barely touched it on accident, they would fall out. I almost lost the left side when I looked down over a sink full of water and it fell out of my ear. Luckily i caught it in mid air before it fell into the water. The sound quality from the headsets are pretty good and the sound quality improves a little when you turn on the DSEE setting, although it does drain the batteries faster. With the Adaptive sound controls turned on and the DSEE turned on, i averaged about 3 1/2 hrs of use before they needed to be recharged. With DSEE off and adaptive sound controls on, I was regularly averaging 6 hrs of use before recharging. This headset was a good buy for me and I have no regrets. They have become my go to headset for daily use. :)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-28,Choose the right tips for best results,"Scooped up a pair of these before they went sold out everywhere. I've used them for about a week now. I will say I had to play around finding my perfect eartips to get the best sound quality and noise cancelling results (the Sony app advises you of this, and although it seems like the sort of thing you could brush off, don't). So if you, like me, try them out with the stock tips and are even remotely unimpressed or disappointed, try going through the different tips and cycling through the noise cancelling settings while standing near a noise machine or a fan or something similar. It makes a huge difference and you'll know when you find the ones that work. It really does blow me away the level of noise cancelling they have achieved on wireless earbuds. Excellent build quality and premium feel too, even though I was surprised at how small and lightweight they are given how much larger they appear than a lot of competitors in so many review videos. I was expecting them to really look and feel bulky, but they somehow don't when you're holding them, even though they just are objectively quite bulky in relation to what else is out there. Which brings me to my only complaint--their general shape and design just reminds me a lot of those Bluetooth mics people wore a few years ago for phone calls. Sennheiser and B&O have much cleaner and better designs and sizes, but I do understand Sony had to make room for more stuff and presumably bigger batteries (battery life kills it BTW, much longer than the competition). Anyway, pick yourself up a pair if you come across them or just put an order in so you get them once they're back in stock. I don't write product reviews often but these are really something pretty special and I know how helpful they can be when you're considering buying something like this.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Talking about charge, one downside is that there is no indicator on the charging case that tells you how much charge there is left on the charging case, there is only a red light indicator when you plug it in to charge through USB-C cable and did I say USB-C, finally an industry must when it comes to cables not some propietary Lightning or yesterday's micro USB connections. The form factor of the earbuds is not bad, they tend to stay in my ears with the right sized earbud tips that are included with so many options and different materials to choose from also, they do sometimes feel like they are coming loose after a while, but they have yet to completely pop out of my ears. One thing that is not clear is if they are water resistant, by the looks of the Sony marketing material these are suited for your casual business or just walking outdoors type individual, so do not take them out in the rain and be weary if you sweat a lot during workouts. I think it is time to wrap up this review with the most important aspect of any headphone, the sound. The Sony WF-1000XM3 sound is balanced, the highs, mids and bass are all excellent and you can tweak the equalizer settings using the Sony Headphones app. I like to listen to my music at loud volumes which probably is not the best for your ear health, and one thing I noticed is that these wireless earbuds are not very loud even at the highest setting. So, if you are looking for one of the better premium options of truly wireless earbuds these Sony WF-1000XM3 deserve a buy.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I feel like there could be some more punch, maybe some of that can be added via tuning ... but for an earbud it just .... works ... no earbud cutting off like bose and jabra .... touch pad so you arent jamming it into your ear to click like the Jabra ... and noise cancelling!!

They all have one thing in common: by their very nature, they are heavier and bulkier than wired earbuds. These Sony buds are no different, but unlike others I have tried, they make little attempt to contour the bulk to the shape of a human ear. They have an oblong shape that I, at least, had a hard time getting to stay in my ear (they do come with a set of tips in different sizes, but none of them gave me what I considered a good fit). The sound: This is where Sony can't be beaten. These sound great, with a really nice range for all types of music. I also tried them with an audiobook, and again I have absolutely no complaints. They seem good at blocking out ambient noise, though I guess you'd need to be on a plane for this to be essential. All earbuds give decent noise reduction. Given that I love listening to audiobooks, a lot of the content I choose is mono. Other earbuds I have tried let me remove one bud and continue listening with the remaining one, which is the best of both worlds for outdoor exercising. I don't want to block out traffic sounds if I am walking along the side of the road. When I removed the left bud, they both stopped playing. You need to use both of them or they don't work. Pairing with my iPad was effortless. I just removed them from the case, opened the Settings app, and chose these buds off the bluetooth list. I had no connectivity problems. I will likely save these for traveling, where movement is minimal and noise reduction is needed. For everyday use, just for walking, these will not be my first choice.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I preordered them and have had them for a few weeks now. Have used them around town, and during traveling. I like the noise-canceling technology in general and often use them. I have/had several other products from Sony and Bose. I was really looking forward to a true wireless noise-canceling headphone. Well, they are not great, not horrible. It is important to note that you need an app to get the most out of these headphones. You can control the sound quality and equalizer via the app, but you have to dig into the app to control all of that. Pros: The case/charger is slick. Very well put together. Neat and tidy package. Sound quality is excellent once you dig into the app and adjust the settings to your preferences. Other reviews don't seem to have realized that the app makes these very adjustable. Cons: In the instructions, it says that if noise-canceling does not seem to be working try to seat the unit in your ear more or try other rubber ear-piece. In short, unlike full headphone or in the ear headphones, these are primarily relying on isolation, and not sound wave interference. I have tried to swap out the supplied earpieces with a Comply foam earpiece, and this helped considerably, however fitted with the Comply foam they don't fit in the charger as well. I will continue to try a few other options for the Comply foam to see if I can get a good balance. On an airplane, these do just about nothing. I have the Bose QuietComfort 20 headphones and on a plane, the Bose are superior to Sony. No contest, with the Bose, usually the lowest setting on the plane entertainment system is almost too loud. The app can be confusing. Some of the settings are not clear and in some cases it seems that the headphones revert back to the default setting. I have the most recent version, but once you close the app many of the settings, especially related to noise-canceling seem to revert. Equalizer settings seem to be held. Finally, the tutorial is about how to get them in your ears, not how to use the app or headphone. Very stupid. I'd expect better from Sony. I'm keeping these since they are convenient, and are decent around town. I'll still try different foam earpieces to get better performance. Unfortunately, they are likely not worth the cost.

How much sweat will break these? Biggest con is definitely not being water/sweat resistant. - Range isn't as good as you'd think even on the ""stable connection"" setting. My audio would cut in and out if I was more than two rooms away from my phone. - No volume controls - Some bugs (see below) ******************************************* PROS: - I've dropped these on my vinyl flooring several times so far and it hasn't noticeably damaged them - Although the automatic pausing of media after removing an earbud is standard on most higher range Bluetooth earbuds, I gotta say I just really enjoy this feature. - The noise cancelation setting in terms of just how noise cancelling it is genuinely blew my socks off considering these aren't a closed over the ear headphones. When I turn on noise canceling I feel like I've been yeeted into a vacuum. - I really appreciate the equalizer built into the app. Being able to easily adjust from heavy bass for some media to bright and light for others to the ""dialogue"" setting for podcasts is something I now feel like I can't go without. I've been spoiled by these earbuds. - Charge in their case incredibly quickly - USB-C charging - DSEE HX audio processor (essentially upscales low fi mp3s) - Better audio quality than airpods ******************************************* BUGS: Sometimes the sound on whatever I'm watching will be super quiet, to the point where I can't make out dialogue. More rarely, the sound cuts out completely. I have to put these in their case and take them out again to ""reset"" them and the issue goes away. I'd say I have to do this once every two days on average but I have been almost exclusively using them (unless they die) for over a month for the purpose of reviewing them. I could see this being a problem because although you can turn them off via the app, there's no way to turn them on without the case that I know of - meaning if you encounter this bug you have to take the case with you at all times, which is extremely inconvenient. ******************************************* USING ONE EARBUD: You could use one earbud at a time but please keep in mind you'll lose some functionality. For instance if you use the left earbud alone you won't be able to answer calls, and you'll only be able to control playback or the Google assistant feature if you remap one of those functions to the left earbud (it only lets you remap one function but you'll get both).

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-09-04,Great sound in such a small package,"The Sony WF-1000XM3 earbuds are the first set of earbuds I haven’t had massive issues with. Are they perfect? No, not by any means, but they’re pretty great. TLDR Pros Great sound quality Comfortable Easy setup Great battery life Noise canceling and ambient sound Feature rich application USB C charging case Cons Issues using with a PC Software upgrade is cumbersome No volume control on headphones Full Review What’s in the box? Headphones Headphone carrying/charging case USB C charging cable 7 sets of variously sized earbud inserts Setup & Software The software setup and pairing was very simple. Download Sony’s app from either Google Play or the App Store and follow the on screen prompts. Each headphone will greet you with a message. “Power On, Battery <Level>, Connected” The setup on iOS and Android went smoothly, neither device experienced any problems during the initial configuration. The software allows you to configure various settings for your headphones. This includes the Ambient Sound and Noise Canceling features which accommodate four presets for sitting, walking, running, and public transportation. The equalizer can also be adjusted via the app. The equalizer has 11 presets, including a manual and two custom presets. Other options include Sound Quality Mode. Used to to set either quality or stable connection priority. DSEE HX toggle Change function of left and right headphone touch buttons Automatic Power Off Notifications & Voice Guide Automatic Software Download I’ve experienced two problems. The first was with updating the headphone software. On iOS my updates are failing on software transfer. I’ve tried several troubleshooting measures and I just can't seem to get it to work. I am running the iOS 13.1 beta at the moment so I cannot say this is strictly a problem with the headphones themselves. I was able to successfully update on my Android device running Android 9 (Pie). The second problem was with a Windows 10 PC. I was able to connect to my PC but the audio would not work. There was a software update released to fix this problem, you will need to download and install it via cell phone before the problem is fixed. Comfort Once you get the sizing down, these headphones are extremely comfortable. I wear them most of the day at work and I haven’t experienced any discomfort nor have I experienced a drop. Sound Quality For earbud style headphones, these blew me away. I prefer using the Bright preset and all my music sounds crystal clear. I love the fact that these little headphones are able to produce the amount of bass that they do. Battery Life On a typical day, I’ll use the headphones for 3-4 hours and then place them in the charger for an hour during lunch or during a meeting. I’ll take them back out and use them for another 3-4 hours before placing them back in the charging case for the day. Features The Noise Canceling is pretty good. Once this is activated the volume is very slightly increased and almost all background noise disappears. This is really helpful in an office environment or a noisy home when you’re trying to get work accomplished without distractions. Noise Canceling is one of the stand out features of these headphones. The Ambient Sound feature is extremely useful for hearing your surroundings while listening to music. My wife and I are able to carry out conversations while my headphones are in and my music is going at a low volume. It's a situational feature, but it has its uses. The Touch Controls can be customized based on user preference. By default, the left headphone controls the Noise Canceling, Ambient Sound, and pairing options. The right headphone can be used for music controls. Holding your hand up to the side of a headphone will pause the audio being played. Once your hand has been removed, the audio will play again. This is useful for a quick pause to hear your surroundings. Swapping Bluetooth devices works relatively well. I’ve only experienced minor hiccups occasionally with devices not wanting to relinquish connection. Google Assistant works fairly well. I do not typically use GA, however for testing purposes I decided to use it. GA chirped in each time I initiated it via voice command and directly from my cell phone. No complains for the GA feature! I really wish that volume control was included as a touch feature. Having to change the volume on the device you’re using can be inconvenient at times. This is by far my biggest complaint. Overall I give the Sony WF-1000XM3s 4.8 stars, rounded up to 5.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-09-06,As good as it gets - but not really mind blowing,"I've tested many different active noise canceling (ANC) headphones in the past and currently also own the original over ear Sony MDR-X1000, the in-ear Bose QC20i, and the Jabra Elite Active 65T (passive noise canceling only). I had been looking forward to getting these new true wireless ANC ear buds because I've recently gone from flying several long distance flights overseas to taking more frequent but much shorter business trips that take less than a couple of hours. This change means I no longer check my luggage, so carry-on space is suddenly more precious and my over ear Sonys started to feel too bulky. On the first day of testing them, I was initially really disappointed with their ANC performance. After giving it a couple of days, however, I figured out a way to make them work and now that I've used them for a week, I can give a balanced review. Read on for the details. FIT & COMFORT This was the reason for my initial disappointment. Despite offering seven different ear tips, I simply couldn't find a good seal with any of them. After an hour of frustrating A/B testing with white noise playing loudly from my home stereo system to simulate airplane noise, I could hardly tell when ANC was active and when it wasn't. I then decided to swap out the ear tips with the large one from the Jabra Elite Active 65T, and immediately I noticed a massive improvement in passive noise canceling and overall fit. The difference seems to be that the Jabra ear tips are slightly wider so they naturally block out outside sound more easily than any of the included Sony ear tips. I wasn't very happy with that frankenstein solution though, so I was very close to returning them altogether. The following day I tested it again. This time, after a lot of twisting and pressing, I was finally able to get a decent seal with the Sony ear tips (the largest silicon tips). You have to press the ear buds in quite firmly, I wouldn't say it's painful, but I can't really say it's a comfortable and convenient experience. But it works, after a few seconds of pushing and adjusting. Overall, I'd give fit a 3 out of 5. I was able to test using it during workout and it stays more firmly in my ears than the Jabra - perhaps not very surprising considering how much harder I have to press them in. Sony should offer wider ear tips with the package, or they should take inspiration from Bose, whose ear tips are oval shaped and thus fit more naturally in most people's ears. NOISE CANCELING PERFORMANCE Let's get real. They're not even close to the excellent performance of my Sony over ear cans, but for day to day commuting and the occasional flight, they're ""good enough"". For long haul flights, I'll still bring my large cans, but for shorter trips, the true wireless buds are simply more convenient and means I can bring a smaller carry-on. I think they do a good job of canceling out low frequencies, but in the treble range you notice the biggest difference between these and the over ear cans, where the over ears block out much more. I felt more distracted when there was a public announcement on my flight over to Berlin than I normally do with the over ears. That said, it's still a very noticeable difference if I switch ANC off, so they're definitely making a difference. Just not as dramatic as I'm used to with the over ears. I also compared them between the over five years old Bose QC20i, and I have to say that Bose does an overall better job of canceling out mid and high frequencies. They're about on par with the Sonys on lower frequencies. Perhaps this is an unfair comparison since the Bose comes with a separate unit on the cord and likely has room for more advanced processors and battery, but it's worth noting that despite five years of technological advancement, there are still noticeable compromises associated with true wireless ear buds. Overall, ANC gets a 3/5 for me. It's good for being true wireless ear buds, but they're not really better than the over five year old in-ear technology from Bose QC20i, and it's debatable how much of a difference ANC makes compared to just getting a decent passive noise canceling through a good seal. Personally I do appreciate the cancelation of the low rumbling from the flight and car engines, which can't be achieved through passive noise cancelation, so for me they're worth the added premium. But the ANC is not even close to the latest over ear cans from Sony, so if your highest priority is to cancel out noise, you're better off with their latest over ears WH-X1000M3. SOUND QUALITY They sound really good. Basically the entire frequency range is crisper and clearer compared to the Jabra, which sounds muddier in comparison. When using the EQ in the app, the bass can be cranked up to be really impressive, much stronger than the Jabras, but crucially much clearer and not as ""boomy"". I'd give sound quality a 5/5, about the best I've heard from in ears. This section is short because there really isn't much else to say than: wow! OTHER OBSERVATIONS The case is beautiful - but really big. I hesitate to put it in my front pocket, which is annoying because the whole point for me is to carry them with me all the time. Maybe I'll get used to it, but I already thought the Jabra case was big, and the Sony is almost twice as bulky. When I have a bag with me, they always go into the bag instead. Compared to the Jabra, the Sony is really slow from picking an ear piece up from the case to being able to answer a phone call. With the Jabra, it takes about two seconds, but with the Sony, it takes about ten - and then you still need to manually press the ear bud to answer the call (Jabra does that automatically). This means that in order to be on the safe side, you have to answer the phone call with the phone first, and then ask the caller to wait a few seconds while you connect the headset, which is really annoying. It's clear that Jabra has more experience with creating ear pieces made for phone calls. Call quality is ok, but you tend to hear the other end a bit too clearly, with too much treble, making me want to turn the volume down. The Jabras have a rounder call sound quality that is easier on your ears. I haven't heard more frequent complaints about the audio quality on the receiving end compared to the Jabra so I'd say they're on par there. These ear buds are technically not sweat or water resistant, but I've used them at the gym without any issues. I wouldn't worry about the lack of IPX rating there, but I might hesitate to use these in pouring rain. The touch controls take a bit of time getting used to. I find that I often miss the touch target and other times nothing happens on the first tap. Perhaps this will improve with a future firmware update. OVERALL This is a good buy if you care about sound quality and canceling out noise in a true wireless package. If you do a lot of public transport commuting and have some space in your messenger bag to store the relatively bulky case, they're probably an ideal buy. However, if noise canceling is your top priority, you're better off with over ear cans WH-X1000M3. If portability and water resistance is more important than noise canceling or the best sound quality, you're better off with the Jabra Elite Active 65T. All are great purchases in my opinion.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The biggest problem with a big earbud is that they tend to wiggle out, so you push them back in, but that activates the cryptic button sequences to clobber your music or hang up your phone call. You gotta love the battery capacity and the sound is pretty good - but these are gonna get parked near a workstation and be my third or fourth option. Hard to think of them as portable, let alone mobile. So - I will roll back to the Jabra 65s as my EDC. Maybe try the B&Os next.

The WF-1000XM3 earbuds take sound quality, range, and industry-leading noise cancellation and put it all in one headset with Google Assistant integrated right in. For me, as an Android users, this is a match made in heaven. I have had the pleasure of owning Sony's latest over-the-ear noice cancelling headphones, and these just take that same wonderful experience and make it more portable, comfortable, and easier. The battery life is exceptional for both the buds and the charging case itself, and the USB C charge port makes charging them back up an even faster experience than competing products. Overall, this is the best sounding truly wireless headset I've used, and I've used nearly all of the major competitors' products. Here's the Pro's: - Either-side, single ear operation - Very good bass - Very good noise cancellation - Google Assistant integration built-in - Comfortable fit and light weight - Outstanding battery life - Premium look and feel for the product, its housing, and its packaging - Reasonable price point Here's the Cons: - Had trouble pairing them the first time, but resetting them and repairing fixed it (but it may have been caused by an update to Android that same day). - Not advertised as water- or sweat-resistant in any capacity. I won't use them for working out. - Inner ear silicone really goes deep into the ear, which (grossly enough) tends to accumulate earwax on the silicone near the speaker hole. It will require diligence to keep wax from getting to the speaker over time.

Here are all my opinions in a simplified list. Also I will compare these earphones to its competitors, Airpods and Galaxy Buds Pros: - One of the most important things to me is USB C because it is simply the future. Furthermore I have many cell phones and tech that uses USB C. (Galaxy buds have USB C while Airpods have the lighting port) - Battery life Is some of the best and in my opinion both better than airpods and Galaxy buds. - Noise Cancelling is far by the best I have ever used, I can be sitting right next to a fan which is really loud and once I put the noise cancelling one with music, I can't hear anything. Another thing is that I can press the left bud touch pad and it will silence everything out so I can talk to people or listen to convos. - I am absolutely in love with the rose gold color of the case and earbuds themselves. - Consistent, these earphones connect to a special app, that is just for these earphones and it works great. The app knows what your doing, like exercising or sitting down and it will also monitor your surroundings. With all this information it adjusts the earphones in a way for the most optimal sound! This is a great feature which I have never seen on another pair of earphones ever and I'm a truly Impressed by this technology. Also connection is easy, once the initial set up is done, you can just pull out the earphones and put them in your ears and your good to go. They will connect automatically and everything. - Google assistant is available on these earphones, or at least works with them. - Multiple sets of earbuds which will help determine size and likeness. - USB C cable included and packaging is absoulty fantastic for gifting. - I love the lights and NFC Compaitbily is also pretty cool. Negatives: With everything good there are issues and this item is not an exception! - Unlike the airpods and Galaxy buds, these unfortunately do not support wireless charging. - The charging case for these are huge and compared to the samsung galaxy buds and apple airpods very disappointing. I like wearing Jean's and the charging case bulges out of my pocket. - case scratches easily and I've seen some scratches and dents from a couple of drops. Final Thoughts? Well, out of the airpods and Galaxy buds, These are definitely the best in sound quality and noise cancellation I've ever seen!!! So these buds do have their drawbacks but at the end of the day these are fantastic!! Final Decision: If you can live with the issues that these presents with overall portability, I don't think you'll be disappointed at all. Anyway thanks for reading!

I originally ordered from Amazon but after a month of waiting found them on a lark at a local BBstore. I love almost every thing about these, The case is big but so is the battery life. And no volume control on the buds. I hope a future update will have this changed by firmware update. Hopefully not just a new model. The noise Active noise cancelling is great but when ambient sound is on, it opens the soundstage like wearing open headphones. My problem was the ""tap"" controls"". When first turned on I can tap through the settings of Ambient Sound Control to Off to Noice Cancelling and back. after one round of tapping,, the control stoops working until you turn off the buds by placing them in the case or using the app. Anyone with similar experience- is this buggy firmware or a bad pair? The firmware and app update has changed this for the most part though it still skips a tap on occasion. As far as the lack of volume controls, I don't know if Sony just rushed these out the door as they work so well, especially through the app where control is flawless, but the hardware controls on the buds are severely lacking for this kind of money. Sony's have the best sound in ""true Wireless"" earbuds bar none. Have I tried them all? Most of them above $150. When it came down to just sound, the Sony are most impressive and top all contenders including Sennheiser which I own. The Sennheiser are too boomy in the bass dept for my taste. Don't get me wrong, the Sony have plenty of bass but it's that boom that muddies the mids and highs that are the Achilles heel imho of the Senns.

When I do eventually get them both connected, one or both will often drop connection or get out of sync between left and right. This is super annoying for a $225 purchase.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-09-25,"Amazing headphones, wonderful sound, bizarre name.","I have resisted buying truly wireless headphones since they started popping up - I've been afraid I'd lose one or that I wouldn't like it or that I was playing into the trend of abandoning headphone jacks. Those fears remain, but it's hard to give them much credence after using these headphones. I do a lot of work in coffee shops, and whenever the noise level gets too high, I can pop these things in and perform a sort of aural disappearing act. I'm amazed at the noise canceling - it really works well, though, of course, it's not perfect - it can't eliminate 100% of surrounding sounds, but it comes closer than I would have thought possible. There a lot of settings for audio quality and even the degree to which you want to cancel noises. There is one weird thing about noise canceling in headphones that I did not anticipate: phone calls are a bizarre experience. I can hear my caller, but can barely hear myself. In a public space, I find this off-putting because I have no idea how loud I'm speaking. Setup could not be simpler. The first time, I barely tried -- it seemed as if when my phone came near the headphones, they just connected. This is because these phones are designed to work with Google Assistant. I tell people that Google Assistant lives in one of the headphone speakers, but obviously that's not true (right?) The second time I had to set it up after wiping my phone was almost as easy -- it just had to connect to bluetooth and the phone and the headset seemed to take care of the rest. Having Google Assistant in an ear is genius. I can just tap it and it will read me my notifications. I have not run out of battery power once (though, admittedly, I only use them in limited bursts). There are two downsides and one oddity to these headphones: 1. It's perhaps a minor point, but what on earth is with the name? I have zero clue what these are called. I'm going to put it here (WF-1000XM3) but that required me to go to the product name and copy and paste it. I don't know what Sony was thinking here. How do you tell someone to go get these if you can't tell them what they're called? 2. The price. Holy moly, that's a spicy meatball. I appreciate it that Sony and Amazon provided these to me to review, but the price of these headphones seems prohibitive. So it's hard for me to really assess the value for the money; having said that, they are, without a doubt, the best headphones I've used. 3. They make random noises that don't make sense. Google Assistant helpfully pipes up with instruction about announcements and the like, and that's great, but every so often there is a chime for which there is zero explanation. I can't find it in the instructions or the manual. After some googling, I found a Reddit discussion where they explained it was the headphones automatically changing the noise canceling strength. Which seems to be about right because when I switch it to manual, the random gonging stops. I wish this were clearer, perhaps on the app? I love these things so much. If you can spare the cost, you should definitely get them.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sadly won't keep :(","I've recently started moving away from corded earphones and started experimenting with truly wireless ones since the technology over the last year has improved so much. So i was excited to receive the Sony WF-1000XM3 but will ultimately be returning them. Pro's: - The sound quality is excellent. **Like really really good** I would put these in the category with some of the best IEM's i own. Large soundstage, warm sounding that brings out a lot of detail in the music i've been listening to. - The noise cancelling works well and the adaptive mode is good in adapting to your environment (it knows when you are walking outside and adjusts the sound to make sure you can hear traffic etc.) - Quality of build. The case feels like it could take a lot of punches and i wouldn't feel worried about it being knocked around a lot. The earbuds themselves don't feel cheap and seem to use premium materials. Con's: - Mic quality: I don't understand why Sony would release a pair of earbuds where the mic quality is so so terrible. Out in the wind and on a call? Don't expect the other side to hear you. In a quiet room? it will sound like you are talking on a speaker placed about 10ft away from you. 1/10 - Connection: I've not had issues with the connection whilst listening to music but transitioning to a call meant the earbuds started doing some funky stuff. For example, i'm connected to someone on facetime audio on an iphone and it sounds likes the right and left earbud is throwing the sound back and forth to each other. Much cracking, much distortion means i had to disconnect them all together. The charging case: It's huge. Like humongously big. Another bulge in my pocket.

Both Sony (with their own chip) and Monster (apple's H1 chip from new AirPods) work wonderfully well. Sound stage: A very subjective attribute to test. Sony felt open and bright and yet with a near flat frequency response - excellent, really. In comparison, Powerbeats Pro felt a little bass-heavy but still absolutely a joy to listen. Bose SoundSport Free seems a little ""closed"" in comparison, but a very fun experience. Jabra Elite Sport was very similar to Sony overall which was definitely surprising. Functions: Apple and Sony are the only two with touch controls without volume control so they're definitely going to appeal to those who hate buttons. PowerBeats Pro has easy press buttons with also come with volume control and thus come in as the close second. Bose and Jabra have terrible controls so they fall in the last place. Jabra and Bose also do not support single-ear listening function. Apple, Sony, and PowerBeats Pro do. Call quality: PowerBeats and Jabra beat others in call quality. Apple, Bose, and Sony are similar to each other so they come in as a close second place. Overall, Sony's latest take on wireless earbuds in 2019 will infuse awe-inspiring audio details into untrained ears making them fall in love with new genres they used to shy away from.

My commute is usually 3 hours each day on both bus and light rail, so noise-canceling is important to me. My need for noise-canceling started with a new job that requires me to commute to the downtown area of a large city. To pass the time away, I started to listen to podcasts and stream sports radio on my commute. After a few days, I noticed that the volume was at maximum for me to hear through the wired earbuds that came with my mobile phone. That is a concern because I don't normally have the volume at maximum and I would like to keep my ears safe from any damage. To that extent, I looked for noise-canceling headphones that were not the kind that you put over your head - they are too bulky and messes with your hair. I settled for a leading brand that was considered at the time the best available. I used that every day for 4 years and despite the wires attached to the mobile phone, I was happy because with the noise-canceling turned on, the volume was set to about 50% and I can hear clearly. The wired aspect of it was tolerated because of the noise-canceling. Forward 4 years and my trusty headphone is now on its last legs. Technology has moved on and there are now a multitude of Bluetooth enabled earbuds available but few are noise -canceling and none that could compete against good old trusty. Until I discover this one. Wow. This is exactly what I'm looking for for my commute. Noise-canceling on par (if not better - the volume setting is at 40% instead of 50% so I hope that's going to help with keeping my ears safe) than my old headphone and wireless. No more wires to mess around with and to get in the way. Love the Sony as the replacement! From my use case, I don't listen to music but the Sony's performance on the music front far exceeds the previous headphone. Using the Sony for phone calls seem to be on par - which is to say it is just okay. Let's just say that people noticed that I was using a headset and kind of tinny and mechanical. This is as opposed to the headphone I own that is made by a certain fruit company - when used for a phone call, it was clear and sounded natural. However, the fruit company's headphones are not noise-canceling and certainly not even close to Sony in acoustic performance. I am very happy about my purchase and the Sony headphone will be my ""daily driver"" going forward.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The noise cancelling works well and they sound good but they have some major issues. They will shut off essentially whenever they want. The app for them has an option to disable auto shutoff which is good. Unfortunately it doesn't do anything and if I pause my music to talk to someone IRL for a few minutes, one or both of them will turn off. Connection quality varies wildly and will have distortion/interference occasionally, especially during phone calls. Shutting them off with the app sometimes causes one to go into a perpetual loop of announcing ""powering down"" or something over and over. It did this for minutes before I put them both back into the case to 'reset' them. That seems to be the solution to most problems actually, put them back in their case for a moment and try again. Hopefully an update will work these issues out soon, but for now they are disappointing.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I tried the reset trick they have on their support page and no luck. The headphones sound quality and comfort is great but it doesn't help me if they won't charge. *********** Original Review: I gotta say I love these headphones so far. The noise cancelling isn't much but in a crowded office building it makes all the difference when your'e trying to focus on a project.

Too many issues right now with stability of software/firmware.,"UPDATE as of 10/28/19 I have decided to return these since I am nearing the return window and Sony has not addressed any of the issues I outlined in my review. I also started experiencing a new issue where the left and right buds would be slightly out of sync. The audio on one side ""echos"" the other side and it will do this until I turn them off and on again. ***Original review below*** I've been waiting to pick these up for a while now. They've been sold out everywhere and finally I picked them up from Amazon. However I have been very disappointed so far in my experience. 1. Mobile app - Needs some work. About 1 in 4 times the app can't connect to the earphones. They are paired, connected, and playing audio through the phone but the app says the earphones are not found. Since you need the app to configure things like ambient sound and touch controls, it needs to be more reliable. 2. Connection drop/ear bud ""Crashing"" - At least once a day I've experienced one of the buds stop playing audio and get stuck playing a buzzing sound. It gets stuck in this state until I put it in the case and reconnect to the phone. 3. Connection speed - the buds take a long time to reconnect when removing from the case. Most of my other buds connect instantly or within 5 seconds. I've experienced close to 30 seconds with these sony ear buds, sometimes they connect in under 5 seconds but its not consistent. 4. Call quality - I've never been able to conduct a phone call with these. Every time I use them the other person complains about the audio and I have to switch to handset mode. 5. Phone audio handling - about 50% of the time I can't answer or place a call with these ear buds as the audio device. When I try to switch to them for a call they disconnect and I have to continue that using the handset. If I ever do get a successful connection see #4 above. I have tried these with an iPhone 11 and a Google Pixel 2. Both have all of these issues so I am looking at the earbuds as the common denominator. I read on multiple forums that Sony released firmware 1.3.0 recently but pulled it due to some of these issues. However, my pair came with 1.3.0 already installed so I didn't have the option to opt out of this flawed firmware version. I hope that an update is released soon or I will be returning these.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-10-08,Great but Not Perfect,"I was eager to try these Sony earbuds as using my old wired headphones while traveling is inconvenient. On first impression, the magnetic battery case and multiple sized ear buds were impressive. It's a very easy set up - you download the Sony app, make sure the Bluetooth on your phone is activated and then you connect. Comfort: I find the earbuds to be very comfortable . Everyone can find their right fit with the multiple sized soft earbuds that the product comes with. Although they look a little bulky at first, once you put them in, you hardly know they are there. Noise Cancelling: this is the main reason I was so eager to try these earbuds. Sony usually has very good noise cancelling features on their headphones. I found this function to be quite good on these earbuds. It effectively tuned out the sound of the subway on my commute to/from work. I really like the fact that I can adjust the amount of noise cancellation depending on my situation - truly customizable and a great feature. Battery life: I seem to have a bit of problem with my left earbud as the battery seems to drain faster than my right earbud (will have to test some more). I've used the earbuds to listen to music during my commute to and from work in NYC and have used them for a few days, charging only with the battery case. I noticed that the app doesn't indicate how much of a percentage battery is left on each ear bud. On my first day using these, I had the battery indicator on my left earbud go from 100% to 0% and then shut off. I had to look up instructions on how to reset it and then it was fine. Touch controls: I was not that thrilled with the placement of the touch sensors as I would accidentally touch the sensors when adjusting my earbuds. I think single tap/touch on the sensors should be eliminated to prevent accidental touches. It should require minimum of 2 taps or a swipe to activate. One major improvement I think they can potentially make is adding volume control to the earbuds. When I'm on a call at home, I may not necessarily have my phone/computer near me. I walk around the apartment with the earbuds on and sometimes I need to adjust the volume and always need to go back to find my device to adjust. Sound: the other parties on my phone calls sounded crisp and clear. My music sounds great with these earbuds as well and with the customization on the app, you can control the equalizer and save 2 custom profiles. Final thoughts: Well done Sony.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-10-09,"Best earbuds on the market, with a couple of tweaks","I am convinced that these are the best earbuds that are on the market right now, with a couple of modifications. I have compared these against the Jabra Elites as well as Bose Soundsport Frees and these win hands down. I also have a large collection of over ear headphones, and the sound quality from these are easily on par, if not better. Here is a subjective list of pros/cons: Pros: sound quality, noise isolation, noise cancellation, passthrough quality, touch controls, battery/quick-charging Cons: stock tips/fit, microphone quality, lack of multipoint (NFC workaround) Sound Quality : First off, the sound quality is amazing on these, but you need to play around with the equalizer. I had the most success by setting the equalizer to ""mellow"" and then adjusting from there. The reason for this is because the treble and highs on these are fairly harsh out of the box. Music with loud vocals or high hats, etc. are EAR PIERCING without modification. Toning down the high ends significantly gives are more flat sound. The funny thing is that I found the opposite to be true for the WH-1000XM3s (headphone version of these earbuds). Another benefit is due to their isolation/noise canceling properties, you barely have to turn the volume above 50% to drown out ambient noise. This lends itself to much cleaner sounds and lower distortion. Noise Isolation/Cancellation: For the Sonys, I found the noise isolation to be significantly better than any other headphones that I have tried. They offer both silicone and soft foam tips out of the box, both of which successfully isolate outside noise. However, they didn't offer the best fit, but I will touch on that later. As far as noise canceling goes, these are comparable, but not as foolproof as the over the ear version. Things like loud talking, water faucets, crickets chirping, are not drowned out as easily as other sounds. Things like fans, hums, etc. will disappear almost completely. What they lack in NC, they make up for in noise isolation. A dash of increased volume helps drown out any other noises. Passthrough Quality: Compared to the Jabra Elites, the passthrough quality is far superior. By default, the left earbud controls ambient/noise cancelling controls, and a long press and hold on the left earbud allows passthrough of outside sounds. The sound quality is very natural, with almost no hiss or hum. The Jabras on the other hand sound like an old tape deck with lots of hiss in the background and had a much sharper tone. Battery/Quick-Charging: Any reasonable person will have no issue with battery on these. I have worn them for multiple hours at a time and the battery has not even dipped below 70%. Toss them in the case for a quick charge and you are back on the go. Touch Controls: I am a huge fan of touch controls as they don't involve you pushing the earbuds any further into your ears, which I don't find that comfortable to begin with, coming from the comfort of Bose ""stayhear"" tips. The left earbud cycles through ambient/noise cancelling modes and also allows for passthrough. The right earbud handles play, pause, skip/previous track. For phone calls, it's two double taps to answer, and two double taps to end. To enter pairing mode for a second device, press the touch sensors on both the left and right units for about 7 seconds. You can swap the controls among the earbuds as well as change it to google assistant or no effect. The only thing missing here is volume control. I get around this on my Apple Watch so it's not a huge deal breaker for me. Fit: I have never been that big of a fan of earbuds, but had success in the past with Bose due to their ""stayhear"" wing tips. Unfortunately, you can't put similar tips on these as they would no longer fit in the charging case. That being said, the Bose tips don't offer much noise isolation. I have small ear canals and even with the smallest tips, these would eventually fall out after light jostling, chewing, walking, etc. To get around this, I bought some Comply tips that also fit the Sony WF-1000x (Comply TrueGrip Pro Memory Foam Earphone Tips for Jabra Elite Sport, Master & Dynamic MW07, RHA TrueConnect, Sony WF-1000x, Sony WF-SP700N - Secure Fit Tips with SweatGuard) and now these are fantastic! They have a great fit and won't fall out. I can barely hear myself typing at my computer with the volume hovering around 50-60%. Microphone Quality: For calls, the incoming audio is great, but I have had many people tell me that I sound robotic or static-y. I've had others tell me that I sound fine. It seems to vary based on the environment, but I am still testing. On the plus side, call sound comes out of both earbuds to give you stereo sound, something that the Bose Soundsport Frees do not offer. Lack of Multipoint (NFC workaround): Coming from Bose, the lack of multipoint was my biggest gripe. If you don't know what multipoint is, it allows you to not only pair to multiple devices, but to also connect to multiple devices (usually two) at the same time. You can play music from one source, say your phone, and then you can start playing music from another source, maybe your laptop, and the transition is seamless. You don't have to disconnect/connect to switch audio sources. This is not true for the Sonys. On the bright side you do have a couple of options. If you have an Android phone, you can hot swap by tapping the NFC logo on the earbud case. From Sony (on Android) ""If you touch an NFC-compatible smartphone to the charging case while the headset is connected to another Bluetooth device, you can switch the connection to the smartphone (One-touch connection switching). However, the connection cannot be switched when talking on a headset connected to a Bluetooth compatible mobile phone. When an NFC-compatible smartphone is connected to the headset, if the smartphone is touched by another NFC-compatible Bluetooth device (headset or speaker), the smartphone is disconnected from the headset and connected to the Bluetooth device."" If you have an iPhone, you can setup a shortcut that will easily get you to your bluetooth menu when you tap the case and then you are just one tap away. The shortcut is as follows: When NFC tag detected > URL - prefs:root=Bluetooth > Safari - Open URL. Using these approaches in tandem with the earbuds being hot swappable means that you do not have to disconnect/reconnect each time, as long as you have previously been paired with that device. You also get audio alerts saying ""bluetooth disconnected, bluetooth connected"" although it would be nice if it told you which device was being disconnected/connected on the audio prompt. Please rate this review as HELPFUL if you found any of the information of use! !",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2019-10-09,Great...when they work properly,"First, the positives: Excellent sound quality. I bought these to replace a pair of Jabra Elite 65t earbuds. There's a noticeable step up in sound quality, and I would not consider myself an audiophile. Noise cancellation is amazing, especially considering that these are earbuds. Now, the negatives: Insufferably bad connectivity issues if trying to use with two devices. If you plan to only ever use these with one device, then you might be fine. But I like to use my bluetooth earbuds and headphones with my phone and laptop, and for a device that costs this much, it should work way better. My Jabras and Bose bluetooth headphones both have no trouble maintaining a connection to BOTH devices simultaneously. Both sets (especially the Jabras) cost less than these Sony earbuds. The Sony earbuds can't be connected to two devices simultaneously. But even worse, they can't maintain a connection to the my computer if my phone is around (which obviously is always). I connect to the earbuds with my computer only to have it forcibly disconnect a few seconds later and reconnect to my phone. Sometimes, one earbud will stay connected to the computer while the other connects to the phone. The only workaround is completely unpair my phone and repair later, but I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this will be fixed in a future firmware update, or maybe they'll even add support for being connected to more than one device at once, but right now it's very frustrating to use with more than one device. Otherwise, the fit for these is a little less secure that other bluetooth earbuds I've owned, but only in that I feel them wiggle a bit if I turn my head suddenly. I haven't had them fall out.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I received them early August when they were released. They lasted about an hour before the left earbud died and would not recharge. I returned them to Amazon and waited for six weeks for them to come back in stock. I tried them out again and committed to using them for a trip to Europe. After using them for 30 minutes on the plane I regretted my decision. I played with the app on my phone for an hour to try to get them to work. Bottom line, the noise cancelling is a joke and they have no low end. Changing the equaliser bar of 400 is a waste of time. I don't think these can reproduce a frequency below 1500. And the noise cancelling is inferior to anything I have compared it with. I have been using noise cancelling headphones for over twenty years, these are a step back from anything else I compared them with including the bose quietcomfort 20s and the 35s. I really wanted these to work. But they only lasted about 4 hours before they died. I fly across the Atlantic and the US on a regular basis, I need six or more hours, four hours is not enough.

With the different size ear inserts that come with them for different size ear canals you can barely tell you have them in your ear. They are comfortable and the size of them are not bulky at all. The noise cancelling is amazing. I used these to mow my lawn to test out what level of noise cancelling they have. I actually could only tell my mower was running by the vibration in the handle.

For years, I've used my trusty Bose QC20s, so I have excited to test out this Sony model to see if their noise cancelling can perform at a comparable level. First, the noise cancellation abilities are pretty good. Not ""great,"" but ""pretty good."" My QC20s appear to rely less on a physical seal and more on active noise cancelling than the Sony pair, and they appear to perform slightly better in that department, but they are still decent. I mowed the lawn with them, and it drowned out the noise pretty well. I also enjoy that each earbud can be customized for controls (unlike other earbuds where both must be the same). Finally, the audio performance is top-touch, and they deliver some of the best soundstage that I have seen in this space. However, there are a couple of drawbacks. First (and most importantly), the fit of the earbuds is not ideal for me. Even trying multiple tips did not really improve this, and they become uncomfortable to wear after some time for me. I'll admit that I usually have trouble with earbuds, so only a minority of them fit me ""well,"" but still, that is a consideration. Also, they are large. They don't really fit ""flush"" to the ear like other brands, and they look kind of silly as they resemble more of a Bluetooth headset look than flush earbuds.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2019-10-18,"They sound great, when they hold a proper connection","I want to preface this review with the very possibility that the issues I'm experiencing are likely only affecting iPhone users. There are many threads on reddit about BT connectivity issues specifically with the WF-1000XM3s, but AFAICT all with iPhone devices. The sound, when it works, is very good. However, when paired with my iPhone (which is 90% of the time), the audio will often sound muffled for about 5 seconds or so, and then return back to normal. This happens multiple times per track, and it happens no matter where I am (taking public transit, walking, sitting at home, sitting at my workplace office, it's all the same). Before Sony replies to this review by saying to set the Sound Quality Mode to ""Priority on Stable Connection"", yes, I've done that already. I believe the connection is weak and the bitrate is constantly switching between a lower quality mode and the highest quality mode, in hopes that the connection itself doesn't break. I think this might be something the iPhone controls, but I don't seem to experience this with my other earphones, leading me to think the iPhone end of the BT connection is fine, but the Sony end of connection is not. This has been happening to me on both iOS 12.4 (a stable, pre-iOS 13 version of iOS), and on iOS 13.1.2. I'll give it one more chance on iOS 13.1.3 (just released) before I throw in the towel. Note, I don't seem to experience this in-and-out-of-muffling with my MacBook. However, I bought these primarily for my daily commute, so this doesn't help me all that much. The active noise cancellation does not work very well with wind noise. On both the ""Noise Cancelling"" and the ""Wind Noise Reduction"" modes, I can hear a lot of wind noise. Other sounds do seem to be suppressed with ANC, but the amount of audible wind noise is almost a deal breaker.

New set works great.","This will be a two part review as the first pair I received was defective. Brand new, sealed and charged by my as described in the directions. The left ear bud would not turn on, charge, connect or reset according to the directions. I looked up all the videos on what the issue could be having them less than one day and returned them to Amazon. Obviously, I'm not happy. The will be the second review when I get the replacement: TBD... UPDATE: 2 days later. Amazon immediately sent a replacement. The new set of Sony WF-1000XM3 charged, and both ear buds worked as described. They paired with my iPhone X (fully updated IOS software) with no issue. They then showed up in the Sony Headphone App. The App shows the charge each ear bud has and lets you set all the controls. Its spars and constantly sends notifications for no reason, but a welcomed option to use or tweak the sound. The sound musically is super clean. Base is solid and I've had no drop outs or issues. The sound level is a little on the low end for me, but I have always blared music in my headphones, so its probably find for almost everyone else. Ear buds fit in ear (read the directions on how to insert them, yes there is a correct way) and do not slip or pop out. I have done 3 mile runs with these and had zero issue of sweat or the buds even moving in my ear. They stay in place. That said, I've had in the ear headphones for years, so I'm used to the feeling. So far they're a great set.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-10-18,ANC and Sound Quality is Okay,"Your not going to get true ANC unless they are over the ear. With this being said, I hesitated to purchase these but I did anyway to try them out. I have the WHXM3's for daily use and the Sennheiser MTW's for active use (gym, etc.). I wanted to give these a shot to see if the ANC was equal to its big brother and if the sound quality was better than the Sennheisers. The ANC is not equal to its big brother the WHXM3's and it shouldn't be. Your never going to get the seal like over the ear headphones although it is decent. However with the Sennheiser MTW's + Comply Foam tips, I felt the NC was a lot better than the WFXM3's. I could hear just a little less with the Sennys + Comply tips. I then put on the Comply tips on the WFXM3's and that honestly didn't help either. As for the sound quality between the WFXM3's and the Sennys, I definitely enjoy the Senny's better especially paired with the Comply tips. The tight seal of the Comply tips just enhances the bass better with the Senny's. The sound stage of the Senny's sound wider. Neither the Sennys or the WFXM3's are going to match the NC of the WHXM3's but they aren't supposed to. Another plus with the Sennys, they are splash proof and rated to be used at the gym while the Sony's are not. Taking the Sony's back tomorrow.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-10-18,"The best, but not perfect.","So I'll start off by saying that hands down these are the best truly wireless earbuds I have owned. Now for the price they absolutely should be, but in my opinion the noise cancelation makes them more than worth it. Sound: Quality wise there is not another pair of buds on the market that come close to this. The lows are low and don't get ""muddy"", highs are crisp and voices are clear even in complex songs. The huge selection of ear tips lets you find a perfect fit which helps to isolate these more and improve sound further. Fit: I've owned a lot of wireless earbuds and none of them fit like these do. Others seem to get loose when I wear them, but thanks to the shape and ear tip choices they fit more snuggly and naturally. They are supremely comfortable to wear and do not feel like they will slip out. Build: They're fine construction wise. For the price I wish there was aluminum on the outer part of the buds, but to be fair that could have impacted wear by adding extra weight. The biggest thing is no water/sweat resistance. I haven't had any problem at the gym, but it's a concern. Software: So there are some amazing feature here for wireless earbuds. First of course is Sony including the same noise canceling chip from their flagship OTE headphones. You don't get quite the same isolation, but it's mind blowing how good it is on something so small. The touch controls are sensitive as well. None of this would matter without a great app and interface to use all of these features. The Sony app is phenomenal. The EQ settings and different settings for noise canceling (staying, walking, running, transit) make it useful for any situation. Bugs/issues So I've only encountered a few. The biggest by far is that sometimes the earbuds just don't recognize they've been taken out of their charging case when only one is removed. This is problematic since I use this for hands free calls in the car. I'm sure it's a simple software fix so I'm not overly worried. My second issue is that you can not adjust volume with the touch controls and they only can perform one function. Finally the case stains so easily. I have the silver ones and just from being in my pocket (I work indoors at a cellphone store) it's gotten dirty because of the soft touch plastic used. Conclusion: These are phenomenal headphones. They have some issues that I am confident will be remedied with software, but if you want the best this is it.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Installing the Sony Connect app was painless and enabled me to customize the adaptive sound control; enable headphones to pause when I take out a headphone (Super convenient!) The initial process to connect the headset to my phone was easy, though when I wanted to pair them to my laptop a few weeks later, I had a bit of trouble. The directions are not self-explanatory; and the directions in the help section online simply told me to, “ Pair them” but without the technical instructions. I dug deeper in the help guide, and under “Pairing Cannot Be Done” found the following: “When you pair a second or subsequent device, put the headset in both ears, then hold your fingers to the touch sensors on both the left and right units for about 7 seconds to enter pairing mode.” Voila! Success. Though I would find the recharging case to be too large for pockets, I find it very convenient to carry and find in my purse. The recharging case is remarkable, by the way. When I know I’m going into a meeting, I put them in the case, and I’ve almost never run out of battery. The sound quality is excellent, and the noise-cancelling is top-notch, and a feature you don’t often find on truly wireless headsets. I have enjoyed both music (perfect for both classical and rock; and my ebooks and podcasts are crystal clear.) I do find that sometimes the activity detector will get confused, and it will spontaneously change to ambient or pass-through mode. But I think it is still a very useful feature, to have the headphones automatically change its levels when it deems necessary. The choice of eartips is nice, but almost overwhelming.. though I’d rather have the variety than not have them fit! Do try a few to find your most comfortable situation.

LEDs indicate charging status and the materials that construct the case are pleasant to handle. However, it can be difficult to fit the earbuds case in smaller pockets due to the size. Setup: The earbuds have you download the app for setup and configuration. The setup process was quick; only requiring a few taps. Comfort: The earbuds come with a variety of tip options including silicone & silicone/foam hybrids across several sizes; I find the hybrid option to be best. The weight of the earbuds is not an issue unless I wear them for many hours consecutively, and even then discomfort is minimal. Features: The active noise cancellation (ANC) performs well for earbuds, especially while traveling. The iOS app allows you to configure the ANC based off the situation you are using them for (Adaptive Sound Control) however I ended up turning this off as I found it to auto-adjust at inappropriate times. The app sometimes states earbuds are not paired, despite my phone being connected with sound outputting to the earbuds. Otherwise, the app has a wide range of features and is easy to navigate. The earbuds have touch controls which I found frustrating. While the ability to have touch controls is useful, the earbuds are small which makes inadvertent touches common, so I disabled this feature. Battery life: I didn’t test them long enough to see the total play time, but I found that after several hours they remained more than 50% charged. When I was ready to take a break, I would pop them back into the case and they would actively recharge until I was ready to use them again. Sound quality: These do a great job of making music sound crisp & clear. My only complaint is that for bass-heavy music, the bass levels are not as loud as I’d like even with the EQ adjusted. However, every other instance sounds great. Phone calls also sounded clear however I have been told that I was not being heard well by the other party occasionally. Final thoughts: The WF-1000XM3s are a great set of earbuds have many features I want in an audio product. The sound quality is great, the app has a variety of features & the battery life is phenomenal. My only complaints are: app glitches (fixed with future updates? ), a lack of any water resistance (not great for working out), the finicky touch controls, and the mic sometimes causes others to not hear me well.

I was trying to replace my aging Bose QC20s with active noise cancelling. Finally, with update 1.3, these ear buds have gained windows 10 support. While there are some current issues with the rollout for this update, any new earbuds should have the 1.3 update as mine did. Pairing with my surface pro is easy, and you just need to press both ear bud buttons for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode. I bought a cheap USB Bluetooth adapter for my desktop, and they work flawlessly there too. Signal is strong, sound quality is incredible, and I can walk a good 15-20 feet away without any break in the signal from either laptop or desktop. Connectivity with my phone is also very good, though at times there are split second breaks between one or both earbuds. This is usually when there is a lot of nearby interference, but this is a rare issue and doesn't really bother me much. Hot swapping between phone and windows computer could be a little more seamless, but holding down the buttons for 7 seconds and then reconnecting the desired device isn't a huge deal when you consider all these buds have to offer.

The fit is comfortable, and I don't really get ear fatigue after several hours. They stay snug even with head movements. One thing I will say is that you have to make sure the seal is good.

Sony is a long time industry leader audio industry so I had high expectations for these, and they did not disappoint. The earbuds come in a nice premium package which includes the earbuds, charging case, USB-C cable, and a variety of ear tips. They feel comfortable and secure in the ear canal and I haven't once been worried about them falling out. The battery case is a little on the large size, but can still be pocketed. The earbuds satisfyingly snap into the case and are held in securely with strong magnets. The case is NFC enabled, so pairing them to my device was as simple as touching the case to my phone. These earbuds to an excellent job with noise cancellation so I feel immersed in my music even in noisy areas. The Sony Headphones app has a setting to dynamically adjust the amount of noise canceling applied based on the type of environment you are in. If it detects you are in a quiet environment it scales back the noise canceling to allow more ambient sound through. If you prefer to adjust it manually, or just leave the noise canceling on at all times that is an option as well. The equalizer settings in the app can be tweaked and adjusted freely to your liking, and you can have a much or as little bass as you want. They also support quick access to the Google Assistant on Android phones, which was a pleasant surprise for me since I use the assistant regularly. The battery life on these is amazing. They will last for around 6 hours on a full charge, and if you should get low on power the storage case will charge them for up to another 18 hours. These should easily last you all day without having to worry about needing an outlet.

I really love the Quick attention mode and wearing detection, as I can converse without the hassle of interrupting the speaker by touching the ear buds to stop music, this feature worked flawlessly. The biggest plus is the noise cancelling technology ...others ""say"" they cancel noise but in reality they do a spotty job, NOT these Sony earbuds they worked perfectly every time including in a call center I visited (really needed it too).

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-10-24,Ambient sound is great and works better than competitors.,"I've had the chance to review the Sony wireless noise canceling earbuds for the past 2 weeks here is my honest review on this item. 1st of all the thing that you notice about these earbuds is the case it's huge and shaped just like Sony's styling should be wary priesteen very elegant however it has a bulk to it now I try to find out why so much bulk so I was wondering does it have wireless charging on the case gathers no does it have any extra features the answers know how about the battery know it's comparable to other battery cases however the lighting effect that the front case gives is out of some kind of scifi movie looks beautiful I think the beauty of the case justifies and lets me go past how about how big it is. now on To the earbuds/earpods (I like the latter) the Sony WF 1000 XM3 is a mouthful to say but Sony has got something here with its ambient sound That the Competition just doesn't Have correctly in the bag as of yet. Again Sony is one of the originators of putting sound in our ears so I think it justifies the fact that Sony should be very good at trying to give us the best features when it comes to hearing anything that Comes from their devices and it goes to show with these sony earpods. The app once downloaded to the device on your phone it has many features that you can play around with to perfect that sound Sony does a very good job of giving you choices through the app and the app works seamlessly and it's very easy to connect the ear pods with the app. I received about 3 hours with the ambient sound on which worked flawlessly with no issues had no issues flipped true the options and see no lag I felt like they have this ambient sound mode the best so far with all the ear pods I've tried so far Charging it was a breeze also USB C is what the charging case uses I wish it had wireless charging it would have been a great feature then these ear pods would have been my choice, sadly they don't have wireless charging so I have to worry about carrying on around a wire with me everywhere I go. The case does say state 18 hours of recharge I was unable to test out the full 18 hours but I did charge twice and it gave my ear pods another 10 hours before I had to recharge the case and there are parts over all it's a great fit and finish it's what you would expect in sound quality for Sony and it's what other Designers of earpods should strive if they want to make something with this quality of sound.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-10-25,I wish they fit,"I was so excited when I received my Sony WF-1000XM3 Noise Canceling Earbuds. I'd been researching over the ear noise canceling headphones, but was hesitant due to their size. I was hoping these would be my unicorn. They sound amazing, but I unfortunately can't use them. Although they come with ear tips in a variety of sizes, I couldn't find the right fit. I thought I'd fitted them correctly, but was mistaken. I know I put them in my ears properly. I even double checked by watching an instructional video. I'm remodeling my bath, so I figured that this was a great opportunity to try them out. I popped them in my ears and got to work. At first everything was fine. Then I swung the sledgehammer. The left earbud flew out. I tried many times, with a variety of ear tip configurations, but I was not able to get them to fit securely. I then decided to try them without doing any physical activity. The sound and noise canceling are excellent. While listening to my music I received a phone call. I asked the caller if the sound quality was tinny and she said it sounded just fine. I like everything about these earbuds. Except the fit. They sound awesome, the phone call quality was good, the noise canceling feature worked well. The charging case fits in my purse nicely. I wanted to love these so badly. I tried on my husband's new earbuds that he purchased from a major brand that also manufactures phones. They fit wonderfully. But the sound was terrible. I think the sound of the Sony earbuds spoiled me! If they fit you, I recommend these earbuds. I haven't given up yet.

You need an app, you need to adjust from that app and turn stuff on, turn other stuff off,... If you don’t set them up for you they will do things that you don’t want them to do like turn off or dump noise cancellation. Battery life is off.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-10-28,Probably the Best Earbuds you can Buy right now,"These earbuds exceeded my expectations in design, function, and extra features. I knew coming from Sony they would undoubtedly have great sound, but I was skeptical as to just how good the Active Noise Cancelling could be. I knew they had customizable touch control, but I didn’t know just how useful that would be and have been blown away by the Google Assistant integration. First, lets talk sound. These Sony Earbuds are everything you’d expect in higher end earbuds and more. The Sound quality is excellent right out of the box. Whether listening to audiobooks or music or watching a movie, you get the high quality sound you would expect from Sony. But they didn’t stop there – Sony gives you an app that allows you to fine tune the sound to your own personal taste including a 5 Point Equalizer with several presets and several custom memory slots as well as a separate Clear Bass optimizer. I was super excited about these earbuds because I’m not a huge fan of over ear headphones – I wore them on flights because I wanted the ANC, but the thought of accomplishing the same thing with just earbuds was a great proposition. And Sony did not disappoint. These little buds do an amazing job of cancelling out ambient noise. If the Bose over-the-ear cancel out about 95% of the sound, I would say these earbuds cancel out about 85% of the sound, which is an amazing accomplishment for something so tiny. And again, Sony doesn’t just give you and on/off switch for ANC – they built in a lot of functionality so that you can have full ANC or you can adjust it to allow more or less ambient noise to pass through depending on your situation. There is also a tap and hold function that will turn it off as long as your pressing on the left earbud so you can talk to someone (it also pauses whatever your listening to or watching) and then once you let go your media starts playing again and ANC turns back on – brilliant! Also, you can set it so that removing an earbud from your ear automatically pauses your media as well. Having Google Assistant build into these buds is great! You can give any voice command you want Google to handle which of course is anything from making a call or sending a text to opening an app or skipping tracks. Sony really though through everything with these earbuds. They didn’t just put out some of the best sounding earbuds with the most amazing active noise cancellation you could imagine in such a small package – they though through all the little things to give you every feature you could possibly want in wireless earbuds.

I hoped that they were able to fix the connection issues with the ear buds. I believe I have had more issues with the earbuds than I do with the over the ear headphones. I am using apple platforms. The connection seems to differ each time I use them. There are times I put them in & they connect right away. Others I have to manually go to the Bluetooth menu & select the device. I have only been able to get them to work with a phone call one time.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-10-28,"Simple setup, reliable, long battery life, top notch sound quality","I am aware that not every person's bluetooth experiences will be the same, and whenever 'truly wireless' earbuds come into play, sometimes headaches are involved. So far? That is not the case with my pair of Sony WF-1000XM3. Pairing over NFC (and then re-pairing 'manually' just to do it) were both a breeze and worked the first time. The Android app that manages the settings does seem necessary, but that is quite OK with me. I haven't tried pairing these earbuds with anything other than my Sony Xperia 1 phone. The touch controls seem to work so far, at least as long as my own hair is not in the way of the touch surface, and I follow the suggestion from the manual that I grip the sides of the earbud with thumb & middle finger, before tapping with my index finger. (It is simpler to do than it is to write it out!) I briefly tried the different ear tips, and maybe someday I will try the foam ones again, but the rubber tips seem to let me put them in my ears more quickly & comfortably, especially on days when I have to take them out multiple times. As for the weight, I admit I was skeptical, but after wearing them around town, don't worry, they're not going to fall out, and they don't seem heavy or fatigue my ears. And while I didn't jog around with them in, I did tramp all over the place, hopping up flights of stairs, rushing to get in subway cars, that sort of thing. In fact, their small size is almost a little bit of a negative (I suppose?) -- multiple people have tried to talk to me not realizing I am wearing something that specifically is blocking me from hearing their speech; they can't see them, and I can't hear them! Although perhaps that's the point of these, so long as you have noise-canceling enabled, instead of the ambient sound control turned up. Which, by the way, is pretty good. Not hearing-aid levels of sound transmission, but not bad at all! It'll do! The battery life is supposed to be six hours with NC on, and eight without. I have yet to test that; I haven't had them playing music or audiobooks or what have you for that long without taking them out and putting them in the case. I do appreciate the case for keeping (magnetic!) track of them as much as for a charge top-up. Not really hardly any complaints about these at alll, except when I first unboxed them, I had to look for the NFC point on the headset -- it is on neither earbud, it is on the charging case. Specifically, seems to be on the front right above the charging indicator light, under the front lip of the lid. The little white logo is not visible unless you open the lid first. I didn't see it at first. So there you go! Unabashed five stars! I intend to use these every day until they just totally fail to take a charge. I hope that won't be for a few years!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2019-10-28,Glitchy with Windows 10. Microphone voice call quality is poor.,"Update to this review: Sony released version 2.0.2 of the firmware for the WF-1000XM3 earbuds a few days ago. This allows me to pair the headphones with Windows 10, but they still have problems: Glitchy Audio on Windows 10: When listening to music on the WF-1000XM3 earbuds, I hear intermittent glitches in the audio. These glitches are similar in sound to the skips in a record. These glitches come at random times, but are occurring at a frequncy of aproxximately every 30 seconds to a minute, though sometimes more frequently than that. I'm sure that the problem isn't the computer, because when I switch to listening through my other earbuds (a pair of Jabra Elite 65t units), the music is glitch-free regardless of which playback source I'm using. I'm also sure that the problem isn't wireless connectivity, because I'm sitting within three feet of the computer. When paired to my iPhone, there are fewer issues (less frequent glitches) but there are still some glitches occasionally. Unable to pair successfully to two devices at once: When I pair the WF-1000XM3 earbuds to both Windows 10 and to my iPhone at the same time, I'm not able to use them correctly. They do not connect seamlessly with both devices. My expectation is that I can listen to audio on the computer, and then if a phone call comes on the iPhone, then it it should switch automatically to the call on the iPhone. This does not work. I can either connect actively to one device or the other. Whereas the Jabra Elite 65t's do both at the same time, problem-free. Microphone quality is still very poor: Same as in my prior review (below) - When making a call to another person through, for example, Skype, the sound of my voice into the microphones is poor. Failure to respond to touch commands: These WF-1000XM3 use touch-sensitive pads which do things like initiate pairing, stop/start playback, and activate noise canceling. When I try to press the pads to do these things, it does not always work. It's weird because they respond with a beep noise when I touch them, but then the command is not issued. So I know the headphones registered that I pressed them, because I hear the beep, but they just don't do the thing they were supposed to do. Example: Press right earbud to pause playback. Expected: Beep sound followed by the playback pausing. Actual: Beep sound, but playback doesn't pause. Another example: Press and hold both earbuds for 7 seconds to initiate pairing. Expected Beep sound followed by a voice prompt ""Bluetooth Pairing"". Actual: Beep sound but no voice prompt saying ""Bluetooth Pairing"" and no pairing was initiated. Summary: Good points still exist for these headphones, covered in my older review below, but do not buy these headphones if you intend to connect them to a Windows computer, or if you intend to use them for voice calls. -------------------------------------------------------------- Original review before firmware version 1.3.7: Problem 1: These WF-1000XM3 earbuds are in dire need of a firmware update, because they have connectivity problems with Windows 10 computers. Initially when I got these, I was able to connect to the computer with both voice communications (Skype meetings and such) as well as connecting with high quality stereo music. However now, it no longer works with the stereo music, and now it only connects with low-quality mono voice call quality. Stereo music does not work at all on the computer (though it still works on my iPhone). Problem 2: Sony has abandoned firmware updates for these. At the time of this writing, the WF-1000XM3 earbuds are at firmware version 1.2.3, and Sony made a firmware update to 1.3.0 which was supposed to solve the Windows 10 stereo audio connectivity problem. However you cannot get this update! When you attempt to make a firmware update by following the instructions on the Sony web site, nothing happens, it does not initiate the update. If you look closely at the Sony web site screen there is a message in small print: ""We apologize for the inconvenience, but this software update has been temporarily suspended. We are working on the issue and will release a new update as soon as possible. (09-24-2019)"". That message has been there on the web site since over a month ago. I'm still waiting, and I predict I'll be waiting forever. Problem 3: The microphone quality of any voice calls you make with the WF-1000XM3 is very poor. When I join a Skype meeting using my computer, the sound of my voice is too quiet, with very low quality, and frequently drops out below the noise floor. Basically, I'm unintelligible unless I shout. Also I cannot control the gain on the earbuds' microphone to turn it up so that my voice is louder to prevent dropouts. I don't know if this is fixed in firmware updates, since I cannot get firmware updates (as described above). By comparison, I also own a pair of Jabra Elite 65T wireless earbuds, and their voice call quality is fantastic (though those don't have active noise cancellation). Good points: The active noise cancellation is nice. Despite the other problems, I can still use these earbuds in my noisy open-office area to reduce the environmental sounds and listen to music, as long as I pair them to something that isn't Windows 10. The stereo music sound quality is good (when it can connect and it works). I found the music to be full and rich when it works. Note: I am pretty sure that these only support the older Bluetooth music protocols, I don't think they support the APTX music protocol, so don't expect them to have low latency at the same time as high quality. The way that these earbuds slip into their charging case is nice, they have little magnets which snick them into position and it feels really good. I tested the battery life, and these do last the advertised 5 hours with noise cancellation turned on (a bit longer, actually, when new). They also quick-charge from the charging case nicely, going from zero to 70% charged in a surprisingly short time. So if you want to use them for an entire day at work, or on a long airplane flight, you should do OK if you pop them back into their charging case any time that you get up from your seat. Conclusion: Don't buy these WF-1000XM3 earbuds if you intend to use them to make voice calls or Skype meetings, since your voice going out to the other people will be terrible. If you want these earbuds for other reasons, such as the noise cancellation, then check to see if Sony has fixed their firmware update problems first.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-10-28,Escape the world with Sony's Wireless Earbuds,"I have really enjoyed using the Sony WF-1000XM3. The feature that sets these headphones apart is the Headphones Connect app. The app gives you the power to customize your audio experience to your liking. First, it provides a nice interface to all the features of headphones. Customization includes: button action assignment per headphone, ambient noise level control, noise cancelling, selection and modification of several equalizer presets, and two custom presets. I spent a lot of time on a custom preset to get the sound I liked and was able to pump up the bass for deep rich sound. The headphone's audio quality is excellent with a great dynamic range. Paired with the noise canceling, you can really escape into your own little world with your music. The ambient noise control even changes dynamically based on whether you are sitting, walking, running, or in transit. These features all work very well together to again create such a rich and deep aural experience. Pairing the headphones to your device is as easy as taking the headphones out of the charging case and finding the headphones on your device's Bluetooth list. I love the fact that the headphones pause automatically when you remove them from your ears. Another plus for the headphones is the multiple ear tips included with the package. This allows you to change the fitting for your ear to insure a snug fit which in turn provides an enhanced noise canceling experience. This insures you have the best fit and the best experience possible. I have been very impressed with these headphones and will enjoy them for years to come. A few nitpicks here: Headphones are not waterproof. I'm not sure how they'd hold up if you are into a heavy exercise session and you generate a lot of sweat. Second, there is no volume control on the headphones themselves. Yes , not a real big deal but it would be nice if it was provided without changing the volume on the device. And finally, the tap commands on the headphones are not always accurate, especially when changing songs. Sometimes it thinks I tapped more or less times than I actually did, causing undesired results. Overall, the experience is great and I'd recommend these headphones to someone who needs wireless headphones and wants a great audio experience customized to their liking.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-10-29,Great once you get the right fit!,"These headphones are great, once you’ve figured them out. There is a bit of trial and error with trying to figure out which ear piece fits best with your ears. It isn’t always the same size that works for both ears. However, once you figure out the sizing they are well worth the effort. I took my Sony Earbubs out for a quick 4 mile run to test them out and they didn’t budge an inch. I like that I could set them to block out the wind, but I could still hear cars coming before I could see them. Next I tried them out at my desk to see how the true Noise Cancelling feature worked. This is where the trial and error with the ear pieces really came into play. I thought that I had the right fit with my right ear, but I could still hear my officemate on his phone. After trying a couple of other sizes I found the ear piece that was just right and WOW! I couldn’t even hear myself typing on my computer. They blocked out everything so completely that it wasn’t till my officemate stood next to me and tapped me on the shoulder that I even knew that he had been trying to talk to me for several minutes. All in all I highly recommend these earbubs for everything from desk work to running and plan to continue putting them through their paces. I took off one star because of the trial and error and the picture directions that seem like they are trying to make it really easy to understand but really words would’ve been better!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-10-29,(Nearly) Perfect Headphones,"I've used these headphones every day since I received them. I wear them when I'm on my daily walks, at my desk at work (one, they operate independently) and at home whether relaxing or doing chores. Here are my observations so far: Pros: - Excellent sound for this price range. - Above average features - in app EQ, Adaptive Sound Control, Noise cancelling - Excellent Comfort - for me the most comfortable in ear headphones I own with several sizes and types of tips included - Aesthetics - this is highly subjective but to me these look both unique and attractive. They seem very high quality. I love the ""silver"" color, which to be honest looks more like ""champagne"" to me. - Excellent battery life Cons: - Everyone lists this it seems but it's kind of a big deal. No volume control on the headphones makes these less convenient to use than competitive choices. - Though the sound is very good, not having aptx HD or Sony's own LDAC seems a miss in an otherwise excellent product. - Though a minor quibble I wish when you override the adaptive sound control by tapping your left earbud that it would hold that until the next time you connect. Unfortunately if you change activity (sitting down after walking) it reverts back to the adaptive control and reverses whatever you selected. I thought about turning adaptive control off but I do like how it functions otherwise. The sound quality of these is the best of any earbuds I own and I own a few well-known brands. The sound is highly adjustable. If you don't like the way they sound I urge you to make adjustments to the EQ and Clear Bass. Once adjusted the highs are crisp without being harsh, the bass is strong without being overpowering and you can hear each individual instrument and the nuances in the singer's voice. These headphones rival many more expensive over-ear headphones while being more portable and more comfortable. The noise cancelling is also very close to as good (not quite) as over-ear headphones that have this feature. I have used the noise canceling outside and in an airplane and it's very good, easily eliminating 70% of ambient sound. Given how portable and light these are, that's incredible!

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-10-30,"Great Audio, terrible battery life","I've owned many truly wireless earbuds in the past few years and was really looking forward to these when it was announced because of the noise cancelling feature and the indicated battery life. I've been using these earbuds for 2 months and they definitely live up to their hype on sound quality and noise cancelling. I travel frequently and used the wh-1000xm3 but found them to be too bulky when I'm trying to sleep. The wf-1000xm3 solved that. It offers almost the same noise cancelling quality as the wh in a smaller package that's less obstructive. The biggest selling point to me was the advertised 6hr of battery life when noise cancelling is turned on. Unless they are counting that you use 1 earbud that switch to the other one when the first earbud runs out of battery, these earbuds do not come close to the advertised 6hrs. I could only get 3hrs out of them which is terrible. Around 2 hrs in, you will get a prompt that the battery is running low. The earbuds then turn off around 3 hrs in. They both turn off around the same time. I guess it is too good to be true to hope for a 6hr noise cancelling headphone at this point. Another issue I have is the switching of the audio modes. Tapping the left bud allows you to switch between noise cancelling, ambient sound, and normal mode. This switching is really buggy. Sometimes it won't switch and I have to remove the earbud and then put it back into my ear again for it to start working properly. There are currently not many options when it comes to truly wireless noise cancelling earbuds so I am not going to bash these earbuds too hard. The sound quality is great and the noise cancelling works well in the plane. I still have to carry around an extra pair of earbuds whenever the battery runs out in these ones. I hope the next iteration will offer better battery life.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Pros: The sound is very impressive for an earbud. The noise cancellation is also very impressive. I always judge the quality of noise cancellation based on how it sounds on an airplane since that’s when it matters to me most and on an 8 hour flight, I was very satisfied. The engine noise and crying babies were almost nonexistent. I also like the ambient sound option when you need to hear people talk. Cons: The ease of connectivity with an iPhone is a real issue for me. I found myself fiddling with disconnecting and reconnecting several times a day which I found very frustrating. Maybe it’s better for android users but for iPhone it is a pain. I found myself just going back to my AirPods for everyday use and using these when I really wanted some good sound quality. Honestly the connectivity was a big enough problem that now that they announced the AirPod Pros with active noise cancellation, I will be returning them.

I settled on the WF-1000XM3 after reading reviews; they looked to be of good quality and the price seemed reasonable compared to similar products. I've had them for about a month now, and so far, so good! The default size fit my ear nicely, but I like that they come with 3 different sizes (in two different materials) to try. Setup was easy, and sound quality is great. The noise-cancelling feature is pretty decent as well, though you really have to screw these things into your ears for it to work properly - and even then, some movements/noises seem to throw it off from time to time. Battery life is great as well - the case does a good job of keeping them ready to roll. I've recharged them 2-3 times since I got them, and I probably only needed to do so once. My complaints are few: it'd be nice if you could customize the touch actions of each earpiece (via the accompanying app) a bit more, and the app's ability to switch the noise-cancelling function automatically is a little unpredictable - to the point that I'd recommend just disabling it in some environments, and manually changing it when needed.

I would have stayed with the Sony headphones but I was not impressed the the non-EQ tweaked sound quality. It was good but not good enough for the price. That noise cancelling was a joke as well. There was almost no difference with it on and off. The NC/ANC button didn't do anything. It would just beep and occasionally it would have a voice prompt that would say Active Noise Control on/off. Most of the time it just beeped. PROS: - Better sound quality than others I have tried. - Fit well and stayed put pretty well. - Light and comfortable. - NFC pairing - I wish more companies did this. - Auto pause feature when you take one out is nice. CONS: - Sound quality was lacking for the price. - ANC/NC button functionality was very inconsistent. - Noice cancellation did almost nothing. - Case is on the large side.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

There was a recent firmware update which has greatly improved bluetooth connectivity. In addition, the recent firmware update now shows the battery life of the charging case. The only drawback at this point is the lack of any IP ratings for sweat which has prevented me from using them at the gym.

It didn’t hurt anymore and more importantly, the noise cancellation was far more effective! My test was with a hair dryer at full blast. While it doesn’t completely eliminate it, the noise level is dramatically reduced, more like fan noise. Another cause of initial woes was the touch controls.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-11-11,Almost perfect...,"To put my review into perspective, I own a Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless (to compare to true wireless) as well as a Sony WH-1000XM2 (to compare to noise cancelling). Comparing these Sonys to the Sennheisers (MTW). 1) Battery life. The Sonys are FAR superior to the MTW. I have yet to run into battery issues with the Sonys. They are awesome! The MTW's main weak point is the battery life. They stink. Power runs down as they sit in the case. In 3 days, they are dead. 2) Sound quality. This is more subjective. If I could sum it up simply, Sonys are really precise, analytical, and dare I say, without too much character. Yes, the sound is good, but it isn't warm... perhaps a tad bright. MTWs are wonderful... I didn't think I was a fan of the Sennheiser sound profile, but I guess I am. 3) Fit and comfort. I have Comply tips on the MTWs, and using the included foam tips on Sonys. I have fit issues with the Sonys. I feel that they don't go deep enough, so getting a proper seal to get proper bass is hard. It takes a lot of fiddling. Once in, they are comfortable. MTW are great, but they do hurt my ear pinnas after a while. 4) Noise cancelling. Now I am comparing these Sonys to the Sony XM2. I haven't found that the nose cancelling in these Sonys to be that impressive. Maybe it is related to the fit I just mentioned. Overall impressions. I really like these. Solid feeling case and magnetic capture of the earphones are simply wonderful. The MTW case has a wobbly lid. That said, there are some things I wish these had. I wish the case had wireless charging. I wish I could change the volume using touch. If anyone has suggestions on a compatible Complys, I would love to hear (no pun intended) them.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

With that ""upgrade"" it's been an amazing experience with these pair of earbuds. The active noise reduction and audio pass-through both work wonderfully considering the size of the earbuds. I can easily forget that I'm wearing them, partly thanks to the memory foam ear tips, but the shape and weight of the buds are still amazing. However, I wish the performance of these earbuds could be more stable/reliable. During walking, connection between either earbud might get disconnected and I would not hear sound from one of them. I experience this quite more often with some other earbuds so I can tolerate that. But recently, after updating to the latest firmware, I have experienced 3 times, in a day, where the left bud would suddenly play a sharp ""pop"" sound and go silent and then restart (I would hear the battery 100% announcement again) in a couple seconds. These happened during a train ride and a walk. This reminds me that before the update, either earbud would still randomly shutdown, just without the ""pop"" and the restart.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Even the rose bronze colored cover on the charging case exuded class.⁣ - The in-ear pieces themselves, while large, fit beautifully and neither felt heavy nor over-sized.⁣ - The charging case itself was much larger than I was expecting, due to the ability to provide 24hrs of playback charging, and I would have taken a case that was 20-30% smaller at a sacrifice of 6-8hrs.⁣ - The red charging LED was noticeable yet understated. Pairing & Interface⁣ - Pairing was fairly simple once I installed the 'Sony | Headphone Connect' app. I could not pair via the normal method I was used to.⁣ - Customization via the app was very detailed. There are four environmental/activity profiles that you can set different noise cancelling levels for. I did enjoy how as the slider moved an image of people, cars, and buildings would transition from 100% transparent to completely solid, giving you a visual representation of the noise cancelling setting.⁣ - Answering calls and changing tracks was simple and effortless. ⁣ - I am very disappointed that there is no volume control on the ear phones, especially as I had planned on using them for activities that generally do not allow easy access to my phone.⁣ Audio:⁣ - I have owned about six (6) pairs of wireless in-ear headphones and without a doubt, these are the BEST sounding ones I have ever used. The bass response and power are unreal. I set the equalizer on the app to 'Excited' and it raise all levels a little and made the treble a little brighter, which really made these headphones shine.⁣ - The noise cancelling was quite impressive. I ran a miter saw a few times while noise cancelling was turned off and then slowly moved to full cancellation and I was amazed at how well it suppressed the saw noise. At full cancellation I could barely hear the motor spin up.⁣ - Every now and then where people on a call state that they cannot hear me. I switch to my phone I come through clearly.

As a result, cannot be used in a rigorous movement without the risk of dropping out (fast jog and more). Besides that, to use the touch controls for pause, play, transparency mode, etc, you have to ""tap"" the side but really you have to A) be accurate with your touch; the button isn't ber intuitively designed, B) press the tap sensor but as a result, you are directly mashing the earbud into your ears which is very discomforting. The pause/play and button responsiveness is also comparatively slow. For example, to switch noise-canceling mode, you tap the side controls and wait a solid second. It doesn't seem like much but it really gets annoying. On the iPhone, the app is mostly useless. Lastly, this is probably an iPhone thing but it's connectivity kind of sucks.

I've been looking for decent replacements for my Westone W40 (~$499) and W30 ($349) for some time. These have a wide range of tips which allow me to jam them in my ears, providing noise reduction (elimination), but not noise cancelling. Over the past year, shoving smaller tips too far in gives me vertigo, so that's part of the reason I bought the Sony's. These were to replace AirPods, which, although I love, don't block sound out on airplanes and in noisy offices (unless I crack up the volume). Note - I solved for fitment issues with the AirPods by using third-party silicone wraps (found on Amazon). Ultimately I returned them after a day. Why? I could not get a good seal in my ears - tried all tips (soft/rubber and the soft/foamy ones). I tried twisting and moving around in my ears (the ear canal angle is weird), and also attempted reversing (R>L and L>R). Good - Smaller and lighter than I thought (only seen one other person with these, on a train) - The sound stages worked pretty well - they were different enough and didn't ""assume"" Rock/Pop/etc. sounds like you want - they use actual ""moods"" - Sound _is_ excellent, when I pressed them close to my ears. Ample bass and treble, and more clear separation of L/R channels than any other wireless headphones - Charging case isn't as large or annoying as some reviews note. Similar build quality to Apple, but the rubbery/matte finish attracts fingerprints Bad (other than sound/seal) - I hate having to use an app to control headphones - and it didn't work a lot (see: screenshot) - The touch buttons are WAY too sensitive, and did stuff when I simply adjusted them on my ears - Ear gels all felt similar in size, which is odd - They regularly disconnected - even in ""maintain connection"" mode (I'm spoiled by AirPods) - Can't tell exactly what AptX actually does (on/off) - Volume for some music (iPhone/Apple Music) was really low Other notes - not all the time - Initial connection was somewhat of a nightmare - took 5 attempts (15-20 minutes) - Software update took 35 minutes because it kept stalling/failing. One of them had charge level drop below a certain point, so I had to charge and start over.

The design of these earbuds are very nice, they look sleek, the case is a little large but very nice. The sound quality is very, very good. They are one of the best earbud/headphone audio quality devices I have heard in the last 2 years. (Note-not all ears are created equal, earbuds for me, tend to have a difficult fit) I use earbuds when I work out, running on the treadmill, stair climbers, lifting weights. Earbuds need to stay in the ear and not fall out and get damaged in the machine accidentally. Unfortunately, the design of these Sony earbuds, they don’t stay in my ears very well when I am active. I realized this and decided to limit the use to travel or office use. In office use, I would want to be able to take calls without taking these earbuds out, since they have a microphone, I want to keep them in and take my calls. The folks on the calls said I sounded like a robot talking, very digitized. I also noticed on calls that the playback I was hearing would pause occasionally then start playing back like chipmunks until the call was caught up. This happened more than once for me. So I cannot use these earbuds for calls. I traveled with these earbuds to Orlando. So I thought this would be a good test, being on a plane. The noise-canceling really doesn’t cancel out that much background noise. They almost immerse you with more sound that you want to hear to compensate for the background noise. I don’t know if just having super high volume is how I want my noise-canceling to work. From a travelers perspective, on a plane, I can’t see how these can compete with an over the ear noise canceling set of headphones. Overall, if I reach down to my bag, an earbud falls out, if I take a call, I need to disconnect Bluetooth to disconnect the earbuds, or want to change the volume, I have to pull out my phone, the cost versus benefit is not where I need these to be at this point. UPDATE: Since the firmware update, noise cancellation has improved. I will travel with my over the ear solution.

I highly recommend these earbuds for their size, convenience, noise cancellation and sound quality. FORM FACTOR These earbuds do no sport any hooks or molding for wearing around the ear; they worn directly in the ear, and are light enough to be worn for long periods of time without any discomfort. Included are several sizes and material tips, to accommodate various ear sizes and shapes. The touch sensitive buttons are responsive and easy to use without have to feel around or search for. The charging case is very portable and allows for safe keeping and charging of the earbuds when not in use. SETUP/SOFTWARE Installing the accompanying app on my phone was easy; pairing and setting up the headphones was quick and painless. The app affords a lot of various configuration, notably being able to set up location-based adaptive sound control scenarios, such as walking/commuting/staying which allow for various levels of noise cancellation and external voice focus. I was able to effectively use this in various activities without having to pull out the phone to change settings. The application also allows for personal custom equalizer settings. I just noticed a setting in the app for 360 Reality audio, which is new, I'm glad they are continually adding new features. SOUND The noise cancellation is on par with the leading noise cancellation headsets, I think having a good seal within the ear they may even have a slight edge in keeping sound out. Train and plane rides are more comfortable due to the the cancellation, it is not overbearing like some of the other headsets. The customizable EQ in the app allows me to tailor the sound as I see fit, as well as a welcome bass boost. BATTERY LIFE I was able to use the earbuds for about 5-6 hours straight with cancellation on, charging with the included case took about 1.5 hours to full. Upon removing the earbuds from the case and putting them in your ears, a voice prompt will tell you approx how much battery life is left.

Also worth mentioning are the Ambient Sound modes which, in my point of view, got even better. The sound quality is top-notch and they fit well into my ear canals.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-11-20,Huge disappointment.,"Lots of reviews on YouTube hype these up to be the absolute best wireless earphones have to offer (or among the best). So I thought heck, why not try them out and upgrade from my Airpods/Galaxy Buds (both of which I own for different purposes). My experience is very mixed on these, they have their good and bad points. Sound: They sound quite nice, a full, rich sound that my previous earphones fail to reach. I do wish they had just a bit more bass. I turned the Clear Bass meter all the way up and noticed only a slight difference and I really wanted to feel the thump and rumble from certain songs but it left much to be desired. Much more suited for genres like rock. Fit: Fit differs from person to person, but for me these fit alright. No matter what tips I used, I could never get them to a perfect point that felt satisfying. They always felt a little loose, and found myself always pushing them back in every so often. Not the worst fit in the world but worth noting. Battery Life: The battery life I thought was pretty good. On a certain day I used them quite literally nonstop for a couple hours, and they were still at 50% without a charge in between, which I think would fit most people's timeframes. Noise Cancellation: The NC was serviceable, not amazing by any means but it was there and it worked. Without music it does an okay job but with music, even at mid volume you don't hear anything around you, which is nice. Connection: This is truly where it all falls apart. None of the established reviewers talk about this, but holy f@#k the connection for these is abysmal, and I know it's not my Galaxy Note 10+ cause all my other earphones don't have connectivity issues with it. Just pairing these was a pain, and that's not even getting into the terrible Sony app to control these. An update was required when I first turned them on, but halfway through they would disconnect randomly, without reason. Literally the phone and the earphones would be on the table next to each other, still and without movement, and I must've had to restart the update process 5 times which took like half an hour just to get them going. After that, it was a true crapshoot whether they would choose to connect or not. Often only one would connect, dispite both being put in the case and taken out at the same time. The range once connected is good but what does that matter when they can't connect in the first place? A true disappointment, and a frustrating product to review. If they had no connection issues, a fit more like the Galaxy Buds and a bit more thump like the Apple Airpods, they would've been the perfect set of true wireless earphones.

I cannot stress this enough, these are easily one of the best ear buds for commuters of any kind. The active noice cancellation is not a gimmick here. Definetly works very well.

I'd previously owned a pair of AirPods, and the Sony WH1000-XM2 (what a name!) over ear headphones. First, the good. They've got decent sound quality, they look good and they feel rugged and well made. There's no brittle or easily breakable part on it, unlike the Sony over-ear headphones that always crack on the headband. But the downsides make this hard to recommend. The battery life is inconsistent, and each earbud seems to run out of battery power at different stages. In my case, the left one will run out of juice as much as an hour before the one on the right. Secondly, the alerts and noises are irritating and loud. The low battery alert in particular is so grating that you'll find yourself trying to avoid getting near the 'BEEP – low battery please recharge headset'. Sony still hasn't updated the firmware on these to allow pairing to multiple devices, so to switch between devices involves disconnecting and reconnecting every time. Why can't these hold a connection to multiple like the Bose headphones? In addition, there seems to be a bug where immediately after connecting to an audio source, the headphones will play at maximum volume before syncing to the correct paired volume of the device.

Well wait no longer as these ear buds rock! 🎶🎶🎶 The pure sound and rich bass that these ear buds is amazing and truly my favorite feature. The sound is so incredible and blows the air pods I have away. The noise cancelling feature is my next favorite thing. If you put these bad boys in and turn on the music I promise you won't hear anything but the music. Truly Noise cancelling. The app also has great features that allow you to adjust sounds any way you like them. Now let me tell you about charging. I can use these continuously for 8 hours on a single charge and when I put it back in the charging case it will charge back up and I can use them again. What's crazy is I can't even tell you how many times this case has charged my buds without charging the case. Simply amazing! The cell phone quality is just as amazing as the music as you can out both in and block out any sound. Another cool feature is the auto-shutoff when you take a bud out of your ear. If you need stop the music just take one out and it automatically pauses the music. Put it back in and you can pick up from where you left off. The technology of these air buds is second to none as it is now my daily tool for all things music and phone related. Don't waist your time looking for other air buds or headphones as you the only ones you need are the Sony WF -1000XM3’s. Bring back the Sony Revolution by picking up a pair and putting them in your ear while rocking out to your favorite jam! 🤘🤘🤘🤘 long live the,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The presentation is stunning, with great design on both the earbuds themselves and the case as a whole. The controls are very well thought out and super easy to use, I just wish that there was an option that would allow you to change the volume. The charge is superb and lasts forever, not to mention that it recharges relatively quickly. On a separate note, the modes are very helpful and the quality is incredible! The depth of sound is so good that I found myself discovering new things in songs that I had been listening to for years, whether it be surprise instrumental or vocal snippets of audio. The noise cancellation works flawlessly, surprisingly so even at a relatively low volume. The best part is that these earbuds are made for everyone, since the amount of ear tips that come with the packaging have every size you could ever possibly need and there are two types to choose from (just make sure to space out the wear time because prolonged wear can cause sore ears).

I did a lot of research before making up my mind on these and I am not disappointed. I did not want AirPods (since I find them uncomfortable and only fair in quality) and I must say these are about 10 times better than the competition. The sound quality is fantastic and the numerous nub sizes pretty much guarantee they'll fit comfortably in any size ear. I don't use them for more than about an hour at a time so battery life has never been a problem. It was unclear whether or not they would wirelessly charge in the case, but they DO. The only reason I give them four instead of five stars is because the noise cancelation is only fair. I found it didn't quite live up to the hype and I don't need great noise cancelation anyways so I'm satisfied with them. Also, the Bluetooth connection will randomly disconnect and reconnect on occasion though it only interrupts the music for a second with a ding in the ear and doesn't prove to be much of an issue in my opinion. I find that the problem decreases over time. All the controls work well and I've had nothing but success with them so far.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-24,Extraordinarily Good,"The build quality, audio performance, and comfort on these earbuds is top-notch, with only a couple of minor quibbles. -=PAIRING=- Pairing with a bluetooth phone is nearly instantaneous, and the earbuds have no trouble maintaining their connection. On a Windows 10 PC, that's another story. The default Windows 10 drivers may not recognize this as an audio headset, and you may need a firmware update from Sony's site to get them to work at all. On a Razer 15 (2018) laptop, the pairing was constantly problematic. I have faith these kinks will be ironed out, but - as it stands - your mileage may vary. If PC connection is your primary usage scenario, I recommend the Jabra 65t's, unless noise cancellation is your top priority. These are Bluetooth 5.0, so they can handle two simultaneous connections. -=AUDIO QUALITY=- The WF-1000XM3's excel here. Highs are crisp and clear, mids are well defined, and the bass has a rich quality that is as good as I can expect from earbuds. The microphone has a tinny quality on the other end, but is otherwise serviceable. If you plan on talking all the time, look at the Jabra's instead. -=NOISE CANCELLATION=- The noise cancellation is nothing short of astonishing, if you take the time to get a good fit and seal. Rarely do ""noise cancelling"" earbuds live up to the claim. These are the exception. -=COMFORT=- The WF-1000MX3's come with seven different eartip options to ensure the best seal and fit. The earbuds themselves are lightweight and well-designed, and it's easy to forget that they are in there. -=BATTERY LIFE=- I have yet to successfully kill them before popping them back into the case. I see no reason to argue with the claim of 5 hours+. -=OVERALL=- If you're using these as noise cancelling earbuds for a phone, these are the top of the line. If you also want to pair to a PC, or plan on making a lot of calls, you may want to consider the Jabra 65t's instead. With those caveats, the audio performance - and especially the noise cancellation - is stellar.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The noise cancellation and ambient sound settings are also great features that can be managed from the headphones app. The app is useful for setting how each earbud will work in terms of controls and activating or deactivating noise cancellation, etc... The range of use prior to experiencing a break in connection from the connected device is pretty lengthy. I can walk from one room into another without losing connection. Charging is pretty fast. I would like to see them last longer from a full charge when on standby. I've noticed if I place one in my ear for calls, I may take one or two calls and within an hour to hour and a half I get an alert to charge it. Longer standby time when not in active use would be great. I wasn't able to connect them to my computer or other devices that didn't have access to the app. Which resulted in the need to use other devices that were more universal connectivity options. Overall, great wireless earphones for sound experience and calls. The charging case maintains a charge for many days which I like and provides the ability to charge one and use another if needed. Recharging the case is also pretty fast which is good when in a crunch. I also found that they can be connected to two devices at once which I love!!

Very bad quality microphone.,"This is probably a very good headset for hearing music, but I had to return them and they are useless for me. I would expect that expensive headset, which inlcudes a microphone, to have the Microphone actually works and to be able to have phone calls with it. But after a few phone calls that the other side could not hear me or understand me (including Sony support :) ), I understood that there is a problem here. I started with Sony's support, which they said that I have to download the mobile App and to use it to upgrade the Firmware. I explicitly asked them whether they expect it to improve the situation or they are just 'gaining time' with me (I don't want to waste my time on this). They said that upgrading the Firmware will improve the situation. I did, and no improvement. Then I looked at Sony communities and understand that this is the product by nature, I am not the only one with a problematic microphone. Actually probably all these Sony earbuds have a 'non working' (well) microphone. So I decided to invest time and write this review, hopefully to save you from making this kind of mistakes.

I enjoy looking at them and showing them off. I wasn't especially impressed with the noise cancelling abilities, but that might be because I'm so used to my Bose noise cancelling headphones (which I've been using for years). The thing about my over-ears, though, is that they're bulky so that is one of the reasons I was super excited for these small earphones from Sony. So, because of the convenience of these new in-ear headphones, I suspect that these will be with me on most trips. Audio quality is good. There is a nice balance although a little mid-range heavy. With some tweaking, it is possible to bring some bass and treble forward but doing nothing to the default settings still produces clear, pleasant sound. I do love the fact that they can adapt to the environment I’m in, which is a feature you can easily turn off if you don't like it. Battery life is one of the most important things to me and these did not disappoint. It will depend on how you use them, but I have gotten close to their advertised life so far, and the case holds another 3 full charges. Ultimately, I'm very happy with these.

I’m not usually a fan of wireless headphones, but I decided to give them a shot since everyone told me they are very convenient. I picked these based on several reviews from tech/audio publications. From what I experienced, these head phones have good accurate sound, base was not overpowering but still present. However I found that it always sounds a bit muffled and not as “there” as other good wired headphones present themselves. I also found the noise canceling to be mostly a gimmick, even when I changed the earbud size to get the best seal in my ear. Microphone quality was okay, could be better but also could be far worse.

However, two issues caused me to return these earbuds. First, the noise cancelling is at best mediocre. I tried all of the included tips as well as my own Dekoni foam tips which created the best seal and the noise cancelling still was not nearly as good as my older Bose QC-20 and QC-30s which don’t even require such a tight ear canal seal. For a better example, when washing dishes, the running water is much more audible on the Sony’s than on my older Bose ear buds. The other major flaw is that the right earbud would sometimes just stop playing sound, often if I pushed the play/pause “too quickly” (never happened on other headphones I’ve owned). The QC20/30s are still the best I have experienced. The QC 20s, though, are wired, something which I am trying to avoid in 2020, and the QC30s had a major decline in quality, i.e. basically started falling apart after a few months of use.

There is no way around it in my iPhone settings, nor can you start listening with the earbuds off your ears because the music is automatically paused as soon as you do that.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-12-03,Solid Earbuds (My New Favs),"Overall these are my favorite earbuds. They are also my first pair of noise-canceling earbuds. I've had a bunch of cheap-o in-ear buds and the Sony WH-1000 series. I've been very impressed with the noise-canceling features and the sound of the earbuds. The app is actually great and is able to determine different scenes and adjust the noise-canceling accordingly. I am very particular so I was pleased with the amount of customization in the headphone app. In the app you can change controls and what the headphones do when you tap them. The app also lets you change the eq levels and adjust the bass and treble. The battery life has exceeded my needs and combined with the charging case and regular charging I haven't reached a dead battery yet with some solid use. I'm glad it utilizes USB-C so it can age well and charger with the rest of my newer tech devices (minus my iphone) Call quality is pretty good on the WF-1000x M3s. I'm able to take/end calls with the touch and sound captured by the mic is pretty good. Given the distance from the bud to your mouth it does capture come ambient sounds and is not superior to talking directly into the handset which put the mic closer to your mouth but it's great for hands-free. I prefer talking on calls using one earbud so I can still carry-on conversations in person and I'm happy these buds can accommodate that. I like the look of the case. I ordered the black version and sometimes it's hard to find all black earbud cases so the bronze/rose gold accent makes them a lot easier to spot and add some elegance to the case. There are a bunch of nibs included to customize to your size. I tried all the nibs and the ones that were on the buds out of the box ended up being the ones that fit me best. My wish for the m4 is that the headphones get louder. It's plenty loud enough for me when using two earbuds but when I only use one I wish it was louder. Also, I wish the headphones were better at connecting to multiple devices. Currently, you can only connect to one device at a time and if it's connected to my phone I have to go into setting and disconnect before I can connect to another device. All in all, these are some solid great-sounding earbuds.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

To have a seamless transition you have to double tap the left ear bud, I found the double tap rate to be very variable The sound quality of the out going audio on phone calls was not awful, sound from the call is very good. i had to revert to a single AirPod to be heard on many calls after being told that I could not be heard.

Once I figured it out and was able to adjust and change settings, I was able to fully understand my user error. I have taken these on my daily walks, mowing the lawn, at work, and on airplane flights and they perform flawlessly. I love these and do not intend to set them aside for no reason. I highly recommended this product. I have been using the earbuds 100% every day since I received them. Their sound and quality are superb and they are overall excellent performers. The case and earbuds both seem very sturdy and high tech. I do have a few minors sometimes annoying quirks: once in a while I hear ""dings"" on my earbuds. I have been checking to see if there are any kind of notifications that create these ""dings"" but have not been able to figure it out. Also, sometimes I am not too clear between the different modes when I am exercising or static and I find myself switching from one to another. I think these are more user issues since I have not really read any tutorials, and these are high tech earbud in my opinion. I plan on going through the tutorial so that I can fully take advantage of all the nice features these have. I also have to figure out how to enable google assistant so that I can take advantage of it. The minor quirk I have about the design is that although it comes with 3 or 4 ear tips, I do not find a big enough one for my ears and I am constantly re-inserting them, so they don't fall off.

The multiple sets of earbuds provided should provide a good fit for just about everyone. I am getting about six hours of use per charge, which is more than enough for most listening sessions.

It's very convenient charge the earbuds in the case, and I have never run into a situation where the earbuds and the charging case were both out of battery.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-09,High Fidelity Speakers in a compact earbud size,"1) A true noise cancelling headphone packed into a compact earbud size. These earbuds are an audiophile's dream come true. When you put these on and activate noise cancellation you are totally immersed in the sound you are listening to. With just the touch of a finger you can hear somebody speaking to you and when you take your finger away the blissful sound of music returns with no background noise. 2) Adaptive sound control is a great feature and the app allows for fine tuning for greater control. Whether you are walking, running, doing yard work, a passenger in an automobile, on a train, or flying; the adaptive sound control can sense what you are currently doing and will allow more or less noise cancelling as needed. It is also active and switches modes automatically as needed if you have this feature turned on in the app. 3) The size of the earbuds are a little bit bulkier than average. They do fit well within the ear and there is not much of an issue of having them fall out as long as they are inserted properly. They do come with several different sizes of gel like ear pieces, and then the conventional style pieces to choose from. 4) They work with Google Assistant, Siri, and thanks to the latest firmware update Alexa has been added. 5) Sound quality coming from these little guys is just truly amazing. I don't think anything will ever beat a true quality set of over the ears. However, if you are a music buff, or just enjoy quality sound and want to travel, these are for you. The frequency response of these speakers is breath taking. Listening to soprano tracks of Whitney Houston voice capable of 5 octaves is a great testament to what the highs and mids can do for these speakers. As for the bass, I have NEVER heard such punching full deep sound from such a compact device. You won't find another pair of earbuds that sound this good as of right now. 6) Battery life is great, I can play them all afternoon and still have a charge left. Toss them in the case and they are ready to go at 100% again in no time. The case can recharge the earbuds about 6 times without a recharge. Now thanks to the latest firmware you can tell how much battery level is left in the case via the app. 7) With the latest firmware Sony has also added volume touch volume control. While the price may be a little higher, the quality of this product certainly makes up for it two fold! Certainly a must have for any techy or music lover.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I always wanted some wireless noise-canceling earbuds and nothing came close until the Sony WF-1000XM3. The set-up process is little complex and needs a little work. With Bluetooth and the app, is supposes to assist with the connection process and ability to provide a stable connection. The sound quality is awesome. The app provides an opportunity for you rotate through all kinds of different genres, from pop, R&B, to rap. Combine with noise cancelling feature, it provides an excellent out of the box experience. The design of Sony WF-1000XM3 is nice and with all the custom ear tips, you can get a perfect fit for your ear. I use different size for each ear to get a tight fit. With the good fit, it can cut out ambient sound effectively. The battery life is all day without active noise canceling and with noise canceling you will get about six hours. With the battery charging case, you can three addition charge for up to 32 hours of play time. If you every forgot to charge your battery, a quick 10-minute charge will give you up to 90 minutes of play time for a great workout.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-09,"Great headphones, a little slow with Bluetooth connection","Let me start my review with what i think is my biggest tip to using these earbuds properly. Make sure to try all the included tips to make sure you have the right one. I thought the ones ithat were of the style i normally use on different earbuds were the right ones for me, but i was completely wrong. The differences between the wrong tips and the right ones are like night and day. I typically use these while out and about, listen to music, audiobooks and make phone calls. I like the fit, and have not had any problems with them falling out of my ear once i had the correct tips on and learned the proper way to twist them on. Sound quality is excellent as is voice quality to the phone i use. I did recently upgrade my phone and had to pair them to the new phone using the Bluetooth settings on my phone rather than with the app, but after i figured out using the app to pair wasnt going to happen, the pairing process went smooth. Noise cancelling on these worked outstandingly well. Flew on a 32 hour flight recently and they were comfortable and quiet for most of the flight. I did charge the case in the seat charger, so i missed an excellent opportunity to check total battery life, but i just didnt want to be without them when i wanted them. These are not waterproof, but when i buy something i intend to use it how i want to and if it doesnt hold up, ill move onto something else. I was in southeast asia during monsoon season, and i would wear these out and around doing nothing special to keep them dry other than what i do to keep my head dry...used and umbrella. I also go to the gym once a day and usually spend an hour on the treadmill. And im a sweater hehe. Even just out and about in tropical climates i sweat a lot. But have had no issues with these as far as i use them still going strong. So overall these are the best sounding of the six different brands i have, their charge lasts for several days of my use. Their noise cancelling is great and they do everything i ask them to do better than any of the others i have tried. So much so, that these are now a part of my every day carry gear.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-12-09,Sony Knows Sound,In this particular moment in time mobile phone companies have deemed the headphone jack to be an unnecessary feature. So naturally the current electronics landscape is full of options. I received a pair of Sony’s latest true wireless earphones the WF-1000XM3 at a discount for my honest evaluation. Packaging Once you open the box you are greeted by a card which gives you pairing instructions in three simple steps. I had no issues pairing the earphones with both android and iOS devices. You are given 6 additional sets of earphone tips so finding the proper size for you is simple this helps you to get a proper seal that helps to b lock some of the ambient noise around you. The inclusion of USB-C at least for me is much appreciated thus cutting down on my need to carry multiple charging cables. The Design With the included sets of eartips I was able to easily find the right tips to get a perfect seal. I did find the lack of an IP rating and wireless charging to be a strike a against what is thus far an excellent earphone. The price point in which Sony sells the WF-1000XM3 other competitors fit those features in. Battery Battery life for the earphones are excellent 8hrs without noise cancelling 6hrs with noise cancelling on . Having the case fully charged can give you over 24hrs worth of use which is plenty for me. In my use I found these estimates to be mostly accurate. Noise Cancelling I did manage to use the noise cancelling in a couple different circumstances and must say that it managed to drown out background noise effectively. Bluetooth Now with other first generation bluetooth earphones I have owned in the past from other manufactures were prone to constant disconnects. I must say I have not experienced this at all with the WF-1000XM3. Sound Quality Music The Sony WF-1000XM3 does an excellent job of reproducing music through the different music streaming services that I use. The earphones offer an engaging and refined sound that allows me to listen to music for extended times when I am out and about. The Sony connect offers a few different equalizer settings allowing anyone to tailor the sound more to there liking. Sound Quality Calls When it comes to speaking to someone during a call using the earphones the quality is just ok. The other party has trouble making out what I am saying at times if there is a lot of background noise around me such as by a train station or bus station. With the exception of the lack of IP rating and wireless charging the Sony WF-1000XM3 is easy to recommend but Sony should offer these in the next generation if they want to keep up with their competition.,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These are stylish and come with a great app which allows you to tweak settings and equalizer settings for use with every sound source you're using - a huge plus. But ultimately, the noise cancelling was just mediocre and they have VERY weak bass compared to Beats and the volume doesn't really go that loud.

I consider these the best sounding wireless earbuds out right now and listening to music was the primary reason I got them so I won't comment on call quality since I really haven't used them for that. - The noise cancelling out of the box seemed non-existent until I changed the earbud covers. Sony sends several sets of both silicone and foam types. I use the largest silicone ones and instantly the noise cancelling starting working like you would expect the Bose ones to in store. Definitely try the others and find the proper fit! - Immediately out of the box, these sounded awesome! I messed around with the equalizer and suddenly they didn't. I prefer bass heavy sounds (think Beats, not Bose) and quickly realized what I had did. First off, I use Android and already used a custom equalizer which was why they sounded so great when I first used them. I proceeded to mess with the the equalizer in the Sony app and figured out it wasn't for me. Changing the equalizer provides very ""clean"" sound changes and you can also add or remove ""clean bass"". I realized clean bass wasn't for me as I preferred (dirty?) original bass. I also noticed the volume quit increasing after my phones ""Safe limit"" when the Sony equalizer on. I ended up just turning off the equalizer and voila, my music was back to sounding amazing like when I first turned them on. Those that prefer the ""balanced"" sound of Bose or Apple will likely enjoy the equalizer but I just didn't like how any of it's options changed the music. - The voice assistants seem to work well. I chose Google assistant over the others and it's quick and easy to use. - USB C charging thank goodness! - With the high quality options turned on and the active noise cancelling, i'm averaging around 4 hours of play time. These recharge really quick as well so I have no issue with battery life. Also, the cases battery capacity seems to just keep going. Overall, highly recommend. I also own Galaxy buds, older Sony earphones, and the Jabra 65s (tested a few others including Airpods, Bose, and Beats Pro) and the sound quality and active noise cancelling with these Sony's are unmatched.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

PROS: * Noise cancelling is amazing for ear-buds. I used them on New York subways and have no trouble listening to quiet music * The sound is amazing -- much better than other noise cancelling headphone such as my QC35 and Airpods Pros. Nice to be able to set different EQs and even create custom ones. * Battery life is superb * I love the adaptive sound control, i.e., you can set the earphones to one of 3 different modes (Ambient Sound amplified and ANC off, just ANC off, or ANC on) depending on whether you are stationary, running, walking, or moving in a vehicle or mass transit. * For me (your mileage may vary) the buds fits snugly and comfortably in my ear. * If you hold you hand over your left ear, ambience sound comes through (good for hearing subway announcements, etc). * I like how you can configure each earbuds touch control using the headphone app to set the level of noise cancellation, pause/play, access Siri/Alexa. Newest upgrade just added VOLUME CONTROL. * The case is very stylish and holds a lot of juice for multiple charges. * New software automatically disconnects from old device when you connect to new device so switching is a breeze. * Firmware updates are pretty easy (although you have to set the earphone not to turn off when you remove them if you don't want to have to wear them during the update which can take 20 minutes sometimes). CONS: * Sony did not give any kind of water-resistant certification which means if you get water-damage you are SOL. Not a problem for me as I wear cheapo sports buds in the gym and my jacket has a hood. But something to consider. * Headphone app does not always connect right away even though headphones are clearly connected. * The firmware corrupted once -- easy fix to reset the headphones, but I had to Google it to find out how. * If you set the left earphone to control volume, covering the left ear to let in ambient sound no longer works and it merely reduces the volume instead. For me not a big deal as I prefer to remove the right bud when I want to hear an announcement or if someone starts talking to me. * Case is bigger than AirPod case, but no biggee for me. * No functionality to find earbuds if misplaced (I think new AirPod pros have this). This is a ""nice to have"" rather than a real con. Overall, I am happy with my WF-1000mhx bud and I only use by BOSE during a long flight, in bed, or when I want to double it as earmuffs on a cold day. :)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony is clearly focused on aesthetics these look great, and they finally fixed the battery issues and added a charge case like Jabra and Apple, which is kinda of a must have for budds now. The second gen was horrible at battery life. The noice canceling is the best in its class and I have tried them all, Jabra #2. Sound is great. But for me, the deal breaker is how bad the Bluetooth is. You may not have this issue, but for me I have a old unlimited plan so I have Bluetooth but Bluetooth sharing is disabled by carrier. But Sony doesn’t account for this. So I have to manually connect the budds every time I take them out of the case, instead of connecting automatically. It sometimes does, but that’s rare. Sometimes connection just drops and you cannot connect, and see a temp device name in your Bluetooth settings. Phone calls are almost always dropped right off the bat. These issues have made these budds unbearable so I would not recommend, maybe gen 4.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-12-12,The best true wireless audio in an almost perfect package,"First off let me start by saying that the audio quality these true wireless earbuds put out is unmatched. While you may get slightly more bass out of a certain competitor, the overall range and rich sound quality truly outshines the rest while the bass remains very solid and doesn't distort the audio in the slightest. These earbuds also have DSEE HX which makes a HUGE difference when listening to compressed audio. The noise cancelling is perfect and the ambient sound allows enough hearing through but is easily negated if the volume is up at a medium level. One of the coolest features is once they are drained, being able to get a solid hour and a half or so of listening time off a quick 10 minute charge! Adaptive hearing works pretty flawlessly as you transition from sitting to walking to driving, and I seem to get a solid 4 hours of battery life on high volume, although the battery will last longer at lower volumes. It comes with 6 different ear piece fittings so I was easily able to find the right size and the case is magnetic as to keep them from falling out easily. My only complaint with these headphones is when attempting to answer or make phone calls, people cannot hear me very well, so I end up always taking my earbuds out and completing the call on my actual phone. If you're looking to use these with high priority on call clarity, these may not be the best fit for you. However if you are focused on finding a true wireless earbud with top notch sound quality, I think you can look no further.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The sound seems average but is definitely better than your cheaper typical earbuds. I think they could sound better though. 2. The noise canceling is cool and so is the wind noise reduction and the various ambient levels. They truly do work but I can still hear people with NC on but it's not bad at all. 3. The batter is great but I think that a single bud get about 5 hours usually. And the case last for about 3 days of constant use from 6am to 4pm. Also if you shake your head very fast and hard about 4 times they will fall out. And lastly the touch controls are awesome. Just wish you could mess with the volume instead of telling Google to do it or manually. Overall these are great but are over priced haha. But thats just how it is. And that's my opinion.,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-12-12,Great headphones!,"To start, I am very satisfied with these earbuds. However, there are a few things that prevent them from a 5 star rating. Im sure these issues could be fixed w/future updates, which is a good thing. Sound: This is where these really shine, the noise cancelling is superb. Once you enable the full noise cancelling effect, you are locked in! Full bass, crisp highs, no distortion from what I can tell. Comfort: It is imperative you spend some time messing with the different earbud tips or else you wont get the proper sound or fit. At first I was using the incorrect size and was not impressed with comfort, sound or fitment. But once I messed with the different bud sizes, it was like night and day. Battery/pairing : I havent run into any issues even running them almost at full volume, plus the case doubles as a charger so thats pretty sweet. Pairing is super easy, just open the case and youre almost instantly connected. Features/app: This is where the buds get dinged a little. So the recommended app is kinda limiting I think and needs a little work. The auto-noise cancelling feature is a bit gimmickey and doesnt always work nearly as it should. I find that just turning the feature off and manually adjusting the amount of noise cancelling needed. Touch controls are a bit hit and miss. Registering touch isnt always on point. Water/sweat resistance is another big deal for me. I primarily use these at the gym and not having water/sweat resistance is a bit stressful. I like the Google Assistant feature and it works surprisingly well so thats a plus. Switching songs can be frustrating sometimes bc of touch sensitivity. Overall these are bad ass and I would recommend them. Small firmware/software tweaks can address all but the water resistance issue.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-12,Great sound + noise cancellation in a true wireless earbud form factor,"I have been using these for a couple of weeks and have been very pleasantly satisfied with their audio performance. Full bass without being overpowering and warm sounding with pretty good soundstage. Battery life is not a problem but if you do run low a 10 min quick charge gives you 90 more minutes of playtime. They come with a wide selection of ear tips including silicone and memory foam which are pretty comfortable and allow for pretty good passive isolation. You are able to toggle between noise cancellation on/off and ambient sounds. When using the app you can select automatic adjustment which seems to do very well-when you are walking you might want to know what is going on around you, but if you are commuting on train/subway noise cancellation makes it possible to listen to your music/videos at a lower sound level. Noise cancellation works great for subway/train. I did try them on an airplane ride as well and they get rid of a lot of the droning sounds but are not quite as effective as the Sony over the ear noise cancelling headphones (WH series), however I prefer the compact portability of the earbuds. As far as any drawbacks, pairing/switching with iOS was a little problem but seems to have been fixed with a firmware update. The case, though stylish in Black with Copper metallic accents, is a little on the bulkier side compared to other wireless earbuds. Also they do stick out of the ears a little more than some other earbuds, and the fronts do seem to catch the wind and cause some noise if it's windy out so perhaps not the best for jogging/running (also not waterproof). However, the touch sensitive circular surface for controls is flat and easy to delineate. Over all I am very happy with my Sony WF-1000XM3 ear buds.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-12-13,"Amazing battery life, amazing sound","Spoiler alert, I really like these headphones. These were sold out for a long time and I see why. Having never used AirPods I can’t compare them but I know from previous interactions with the headphones design and shape that they’d fall out regularly. Which is why I guess the pro version seems to have addressed this. But back to the products in hand. They had been recommended to me by the same friend who had used the over ear WH-1000XM3’s hmmm and loved them. Like their over ear older brother they’re light and sleek looking. I needed something low profile to work out in and just take up less space. The over ear counter part is at times sometimes too impractical for working out but the WF-1000XM3’s small shape and light weight design are great for training. I did a head shake test and the headphones stayed very secure. As such I trust them for working out. I will say that on an Airplane I would opt for the over the ear WF-1000XM3 for noise cancellation. The other thing is that because they are larger and therefore more visible people tend to ‘get the message’ that you do not wish to be disturbed, unlike when using the in ear headphones. I have used other wireless earbuds. While the case that they came with was smaller it didn’t hold nearly as much battery life. In the time that I have been using them over the past month, it has been rare for the headphones to not be fully charged when I’ve pulled them out of the case. The case (though sometimes a little bulky) and the headphones are also much better looking and the headphones are more comfortable to wear. As you would expect most of there is an app which helps you to connect to your smartphone. You can do a lot to customize the settings and like with the over head version, the automatic mode helped to set audio levels with minimal effort from me. Couple things to note here. As a busy man I often don’t get to read manuals and watch tutorials on new gear that I get. So I expect things to work straight out of the box. These did but that brings me to my second point. I haven’t taken time to work out the things like how to change the track or the volume but do know how to pause and play music, which is enough for me to enjoy the experience. I don’t like that when adjusting to different sound environments the headphones stop playing music. It can be quite jarring when listening to something. I also don’t like the size of the case as sometimes it doesn’t fit in to pockets discreetly. I do like that the headphones seem to know when I take them out of my ears and when I return them to my ears. This is simple and effective. Sound quality is amazing with note bass and depth than I would expect from something so small. The app gives many options for changing the way the music sounds with a range of presets. Noise cancellation is much better than I would expect for in ear headphones and again I was pleasantly surprised by just how well the noise was handled. Altogether a great product. Worth investing in.

It will keep crashing out when user starts the app. Only when notifications is disabled for it under general->notifications then the app will start. It took me hours to figure this out, otherwise the app wouldn't start and we need this app to get this to work and after spending so much time with it, the connectin keeps dropping. Frustration doesn't even begin to describe it! Edit: Finally figured out the issue of constant disconnection, if your house has anything that is using the ancient bluetooth 2.0, it will interfere with the 1000XM3's connection and cause it to drop constantly. I had a USB bluetooth 2.0 adapter connected to my PC and when my PC is switched off, all connection issues stopped. So, if you exeperience constant disconnections at home, move outside 20-30metres and if all turns out well, then it sure is something that interferes with it. I disabled bluetooth on my PC and there has not been any disconnection since. I would now rate this a 4.0 due to the above-mentioned app issue.

This type of sound signature is not for me--would be extremely fatiguing to listen to because I would constantly feel like I am missing frequencies and exacerbated by an over-emphasized low-end. To my ears, the Sabbat E12 is 10x better with a far expanded sound stage and still has a very present, good bass. Even the Airpods Pro has more balanced sound and real ANC. But if you like this sound signature make sure to try all the ear tips, the large foam ones fit best for me and had the best seal. Separately, I also tested the Airpods Pro for a while now. Previously, the ANC really bothered me--gave me some nauseating cabin-pressure feeling, but I've grown accustomed to it, it makes a world of difference in noisy environments, and it is much less fatiguing now. It really is the best all-rounder and obviously the clear winner, regardless, if you have an iPhone. I do make a lot of phone calls, however, and the Airpods 2 are still hands down the best for phone calls so I keep that by my desk at all times so I can easily multi-task and pull up stuff on the computer during a call. With Airpods Pro, the recipient often cannot hear me clearly, even indoors, let alone if outdoors and noisy/windy. I bought the the WF-1000XM3 on sale but I'm returning it tomorrow. What a waste of time. Sabbat E12 - for daily walk Airpods Pro - in the pocket for daily use Airpods 2 - at the desk and on-the-go if I'm expecting an important call",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-16,Best sounding earbuds I’ve ever had!,"these are great and I love them, but they’re not perfect. Pros: These are the best sound quality earbuds I’ve ever owned. Mixed with the Sony app they have a lot of adjustability when it comes to the sound signature which is great. The noise cancelling is good but not spectacular. Do not expect the same level of noise cancelling as the over the ear headphones, but that being said they do the job well and the ambient settings are nice but overkill. An on or off setting would be fine like with the airpods pro, I don’t need 10 ambient settings. Other than that these fit wonderfully in my ears and they include foam tips which I much prefer to the silicon. Phone calls work well and the microphone pics up my voice well. Cons: So here’s the thing, there are some cons. While they do fit in my ears well they do stick out a bit so when I wear my winter hat they dig into my ears a bit. Also I’ve been having intermittent connection issues, I don’t know if this is because I have an iPhone but it’s worth noting. If you are an Apple user the iPods pro are much more intuitive for you’re phone and a lot easier. They have an on/off ambient noise setting and are much more portable and streamlined in the ear. That brings me to my next point the case. Airpods definitely have an advantage here as the case is much smaller and more portable. I usually carry a bag so this isn’t an issue but it’s something to think about if you’re using these as daily driver earbuds. Also I would not use these in the gym, they do have a coating but I wouldn’t push the limits for a pair this expensive. Get some jbird vista’s, they’re completely sweat and waterproof. Summery: These are great if you value great sound quality, customization, and noise cancelling earbuds. These are a perfect cheaper alternative to the over the ear headphones by Sony and work very well as daily drivers if you don’t mind the case size. That being said, If I’m not carrying a bag I’m going to grab my airpods pro but with my bag I would definitely take these especially if I need good quality audio (I’m a professional singer).",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The earbuds are heavy, look massive in the ear, look like a hearing aid, doesn’t fit your ears well and to top it all off, the features that they touted, don’t work that well. The pause audio feature when you remove one earbud sometimes works and when one is out of the ear the music starts playing for no reason. There’s just so much going on with the sony headphones app, in this case too much choice isn’t good. It basically dictates to you what it thinks is best with all of this ‘advanced tech’ when all you need are simple on and off options and an EQ. Sound quality is good but I’m sure you could choose Bose, Beats, B&O, JBL etc and get the same quality so i don’t think you should be buying these purely for sound because you can get the same from nearly 15 other earbuds.

The call voice quality was so utterly horrific it's hard to describe, it's hard to even believe, it's that bad. When talking on the phone sometimes your voice is too quiet, and sometimes normal volume, randomly. Your voice sometimes sounds bad and robotic but in a way that is terrible but tolerable, but that is as good as it ever gets, it never gets better and it often gets worse. I've had people frequently say that the sound quality was so bad they can't even bear it. Sometimes it sounds like a drunken robot doing a revenge version of Darth Vadar at robot karaoke night.

I bought the first mdr1000x's when they first went head to head with bose's qc35's so getting these or their newer over the ear noise canceling headphones. These fit my work usage much better. When buying these I already knew of the flaw of not being able to adjust volume from the ear buds themselves. I decided it wasn't enough of a drawback and I can happily say it's not bad. If anything while I'm at work I don't adjust volume much unless I know I don't need to talk to people. Now Sony did end up pushing an update that introduced the ability to adjust volume from either the left or right ear buds, but that is at the cost of sacrificing one of the more (in my opinion) more critical features. In order to enable volume adjustment you have to give up the ability to change the noise canceling mode/press and hold for ambient sound or the ability to skip or replay tracks. I find myself using the aforementioned features much more than adjusting volume. If the volume adjust methods were worked into one of the other options better I'd give these a full 5 stars. Other than this they're great. Battery life with any form of noise canceling on will drain the battery faster but the charging case is amazing at giving these buds with enough charge to use them in a short amount of time. The taking one bud out feature to pause music can be spotty at times (having my finger accidentally touch the sensor on the ear bud will give a false positive that they are back in my ear, and my music or the video I'm watching will begin playing til I take my finger off. The case isn't too large and fits nicely in my pocket. The ear tips they sent with them are generous and have allowed me to fine tune how comfortablr these are in my ears. The ambient noise feature is amazing for allowing me to listen to my coworkers and music at the same time.

This is according to Sony the msnufacture. My experience has been they wont stay in my ears. They are hard to locate when they drop in the grass.

Like some other reviewers (those having given very few stars) I completely agree that you should NOT buy these earbuds if you're looking for noise cancellation as one of your primary goals in this product. I've tried absolutely all the buds (2 types and 3 sizes for each), deep and not so deep into my ear canal, dragging on my ear while pushing them in (as some Sony instructions suggest), and nothing had any effect other than minor noise reduction with the noise cancelling on (fully, i.e. ambient sounds switched off). I also tried the 3 nodes (active NC, Ambient sound, everything off) and in terms of ambient noises around me in different environments (e.g. hum of a shopping center, hum of a street, etc.), there was almost no perceptible difference between these 3 nodes. Finally, I then did 2 comparisons in the same noise environment (shopping center): a) tried my JBL Free regular earbuds, and the Sony product and the JBL one both provided a rather similar amount of noise reduction (mostly stemming from you partly blocking the noise physically since you have a physical earbud in your ear). But noise reduction by both of them was rather minimal; b) tried putting on interchangeably the on-ear noise cancelling headphones (Sony and Bose) and the Sony NC earbuds. It's there that I really saw that any really notable noise cancelling that you (finally) get is from the on-ear NC headphones. From both of my tests above, Sony's MF-1000XM3 product is all marketing and advertising with almost no real effect of the noise cancelling kind. Another negative for me is the battery - after about 2 hours of use the system told me that the battery is very low and I need to recharge... The only positive with these earbuds is good music sound in the NC mode. But to really experience it (aiming to reduce the environmental ambient noise) you have to increase the volume almost up to the maximum (which the NC earbuds should be meant to help avoid!). So, bottom line is - do NOT waste your money on these earbuds if you're looking for any really notable noise cancellation! P.S.

I live in NY and wanted something that had noise cancelling, was wireless and not bulky. I was initially going to get the WH-1000XM3's but then Sony came out with these earbuds using similar noise cancellation technology, so I gave it a go. I am SOOOOOO glad that I did. For reference, I was previously using the Beats X headphones and really liked them. Battery life was great, quick charging, but they died on me after a year. I went shopping around for other options. I tried the Bose Soundsport Wireless headphones, they were comfortable, but the sound was not good in my opinion. For Bose Headphones I expected much more, I then went on to the Powerbeats Pros, and those dug into my ear like no other. They were super uncomfortable, didn't offer noise cancellation and didn't pass the train listening test for me. I didn't bother with AirPods because the regular Apple earbuds never fit my ears, and the sound quality never impressed me. I returned the Bose & Powerbeats Pros, and luckily a friend sent an article about the Sony WF-1000XM3 coming out I think a month later. I pre-ordered them from Amazon and honestly won't go back to another brand. Sony did a phenomenal job with these earbuds. I don't get any fatigue from wearing these and honestly forget that I am after a while. They stay in my ear without any issues, even when I'm in the gym on the treadmill. The battery lasts the six hours as advertised and the charging case charges it very quickly. I maybe charge the case 2-3/week at max. The sound is incredibly remarkable, especially for the form factor. The adaptive sound control, ambient sound control, customization of both, as well as the EQ customization is such a welcome change. There are presets for EQ, but you can also change them based on your preferences. I love bass, and adjusted accordingly, and these earbuds deliver without any problems whatsoever. Sony has been continuously updating the earbuds via the app, and allow you to change the controls on the touchpads on either earbud and I love it. Coming from Beats X to these absolute stunners was what I didn't know I was missing in headphones. If you're looking for noise cancelling earbuds, with great customization, that don't break the bank, these are the ones you NEED to get.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

For the absolute best combination of sound and noise cancellation I recommend you go with the excellent, excellent over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3 (which I also own.) To me the problem with over-ear headphones is they make a groove on my long-ish hair (POC problems) and I don't want to walk around the office with jacked up hair. Aside from blocking out regular office noise, sound is the most important thing to me, and these are the best-sounding pair of earphones I have ever owned. Sounds are amazingly clear, they pack a decent amount of bass, and instruments just come alive while you're listening. The case is sleek-looking and the earpieces snap in with a satisfying magnetic click.

Primarily listen to music but need for phone use throughout the day. Now to the good stuff- the size is perfect, small enough to not feel like you're putting on old school bluetooth headphones but not too small that they get lost when juggling your stuff around. The design/comfort is great for long duration, and plenty of different ear tip options come packaged and after-market options exist depending on how picky you are. Now the big selling point that I neglected to really weigh heavily until I used them; the noise cancelling features on these are impressive, and more impressive considering these are ear buds and not over the ear. The mics on each side allow you to ""throttle"" the amount of incoming noise, and even have it ""voice focused"" so you can listen to music while in a public setting and still hear people around you. No more days of people waving at you while you are doing heads down work at your desk. And with a simple push on the left side, you can give it a ""complete pass through"" for any quick conversations or if you need to hear an announcement and quickly resume listening. The full noise cancelling is impressive. Any consistent background noise; fans, trains, rushing air, traffic drone in the city - will be eliminated. Any ""spikes"" will still come through as expected, but wow. Really impressive tech. Now the sound - I am always seeking a good low end from my listening devices and these DELIVER. If you crave a ""full sound"" for instrumental music, these give you a complete sound rather than a distinct left/right. I cannot praise the range of sound enough when comparing to your standard wired buds with phones or the mid-tier samsung wireless BT earbuds. They are far better than anything you get pre-packaged with your device. Connectivity - this is the only hurdle I've had so far. My one older laptop had a little trouble but after seeking an updated driver, was resolved. Connectivity appears to be impacted on my older Galaxy phone/on a busy train/Optimize quality over connectivity - BUT if I selected within the Sony app ""Optimize for connectivity"" it was resolved, and I could not pick up on any difference in my quality of sound. When you get them, just run through your devices and be sure your computer drivers are up to speed. Carrying case is small enough, and gets you through ""days"" from my initial testing. I have yet to really drain them but appears to be on point with the ratings.

This lowers system noise and gives you cleaner audio. You can assign a tripple click shortcut to the on/off button on the iPhone X to switch between black and white and color. One more tweak is if you are connected to wifi, separate the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands on your router and connect only to the 5ghz band. This lowers system noise and gives cleaner audio.

I have owned a lot of true wireless earbuds, including every generation of the Airpods and the previous generation of these Sony earbuds. I got a good deal on these, but I had to return them for several reasons: 1) They will not stay in my ears. I have always had issues with earbuds that have tips that ""seal"" in your ears. Airpods actually work great for me because they just sit in my ears, but anything that has a rubber tip that squishes in works its way out while I'm wearing it. It's annoying and frustrating. The difference is, the previous generation had little tips that rested against the inside fold of your ear. Wingtips, if you will. These do not have those, so the only thing holding them in is your ear canal's ability to grip them. With that, they would never stay in my ears. I tried every single tip size and they all just kept popping out. 2) Noise cancelling: All of the reviewers seem to be praising this. These have been declared the best noise cancelling ear buds on the market. I'm hear to tell you that, for me, that was not the case. The Airpods Pro did a much better job. That could be because these things wouldn't stay in my ears, but even right after twisting them in, the noise canceling was pretty weak. Definitely not what I was expecting. 3) They are huge and the case is huge. It's really good quality and I like how they magnetize. It's much better than the previous generation, but it's a big thing to carry around in your pocket and the earbuds themselves are pretty large. Lastly, Sony please learn to name things. No one is talking about your WF-1000XM3 earbuds because no one knows what that is, even people who own them. Learn to name and learn to market. You want people to get excited and talk about your products? Name them so that people can remember what they're called.

I won't go into detail about the sound, plenty of other reviewers have done so. these are some of the best sounding wireless earbuds on the market. Bass is solid, highs are crisp, things do sound good. The noise cancellation is excellent, perfect for an office environment. Not quite as great on a plane or such as the gold standard Bose cans, but for in-ear headphones I've yet to find something that beats them. And the battery life is as good as you can get at the moment, with plenty of reserve in the case and a quick recharge. Unfortunately, the experience of using them is just too wonky to recommend. Using with the latest iPhone 11 Pro, the Bluetooth connection itself is mostly stable, stuttering occasionally in crowded urban environments but nothing too bad. However, the Bluetooth functionality is all over the place. Sometimes upon placing a call, the headphones just disconnect and don't attempt to reconnect. The software that comes with the headphones is clunky, and often fails to connect to the headphones. Updates take several attempts, and notifications for the updates come through days after you've updated the software (often in the middle of the night). The control surfaces (in place of buttons) on the buds themselves are not well-designed, requiring a hard tap that only occasionally registers, making double-taps impossible and sending a resonating thud through your ears when you try to use them. Call quality, as others have noted, is pretty terrible when it works at all. Even in a quiet room callers tell me I sound muffled, and when outside or even in a noisier office environment I can't be heard by the other party. These are unfortunately not useful for phone calls at this time, despite several software updates promising to ""improve call quality"". All in all these are frustrating- they do the job well when they do the job, but too consistently they simply do not.

I could not find a set of tips that came with the Sonys that would give me the bass they are capable of. I found that the AWADUO for Sony WF-1000XM3 Silicone Eartips worked best for me. Good fit and really good bass response. But, fit is highly dependent on the shape of your ear canals. So, try the Sony tips first then if they don't work find something else. As with any ear buds, a tight fit is essential for good bass. I also tried the Comply Isolation Plus Memory Foam Earphone Tips. Good fit but I just did not like the way they felt in my ears. Now for the negative: the touch controls on the Sony ear buds are a real pain in the rear. When trying to adjust the position of them in my ears, I would always turn them off or change the sound processing by accident. Thankfully, the touch controls can be turned off with the Sony app. So, I am happy with my purchase and am looking forward to many hours of wireless listening.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Of course, with sweating the ear pads can get destroyed in a month so decided to get and extra pair of cheap wireless earbuds for treadmill use so got he Sony's Wi-Xb400 which are cheap but very well rated here on Amazon. Well, as soon I put the Xb400s ON I almost got sick of how horrible those things sound. Lot of bass but nothing else. I was so spoiled by the WH-1000XM3 that I felt that most likely I wouldn't ever being able to use another headphones or earbuds. Well after looking to some reviews, and even that the WF-1000XM3 are not IPX rated but a lot of people use them for workout, I decided to purchase a pair last night via Amazon Fresh and got them delivered this morning. As soon I put these things ON, a big smile came back to my face. I had to tweak a bit the EQ settings to match the sound of the WH-1000XM3 but now they sound so good that I don't know which pair I like the best.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-01-22,First Time Experiencing Wireless Earbuds,"To start off, no I am not being paid to write this review. On the contrary, I have never owned a pair of wireless earbuds prior to getting these. I have always used earbuds you have to plug in. This means the experience you are reading right now is raw, first time wireless earbuds experience. What drew me to choose these earbuds was their noise cancelation feature that seemed to stand out among other well-known wireless earbuds and the touch sensor capabilities. Thankfully, it was good I bought the earbuds when I did (Started using them December 23rd) because there were some bad reviews on certain features in the past. Those problems had all been addressed by the time I got them. To get to the point, do I like them? Of course! They are amazing and I am always in a state of wonder with how cool this technology is and how well it works. I have been using them every day at work in a call center environment. Perfect testing grounds for measuring the full capability of the earbuds. Let's start with the negatives because I certainly know the flaws having used them for a month. First off, I struggled finding the right earbud size. Some would say it's a positive that the box comes with several types of earbud sizes which it is. However, I was frustrated because I didnt know how to know which one fits best XD So, it really just came down to me having to try every single size to see what fit best. The earbuds are a little on the heavy side (not too much) because of the touch sensor part. So, choosing the right earbud size is vital. Once I got the right fit, things were much better. Second problem I had was the learning curve that came with using the app in conjunction with the earbuds. All I have to say is the sooner you get the hang of using the app the sooner you will enjoy using the earbuds, experiencing all the features to the fullest. Examples of some frustrations came with understanding how ambient sound mode works, figuring out whether I wanted the auto noise atmosphere change feature to be on, and understanding how voice assistance works in conjunction with the touch sensors. Ambient sound mode allows you to control how much you let voices from around you filter in through the earbuds. The app let's you set your preference with an adjustable bar ranging 1 to 10. 10 means your letting pretty much all voices from around you come in through the earbuds. 1 means very very little voices will be let through. With that knowledge on my belt, I noticed the feature of auto noise atmosphere change. Something was really bothering me as I walked around with the earbuds when I would hear a beeping noise and suddenly the sound changed. It was a delayed change of sound. What this feature does is adjust the noise level based on where you are so if you are in a very noisy place, it will automatically switch to a quieter sound mode so you can hear your music. If you are in a quiet area, it will balance out so you can hear voices around you while still being able to hear your music. It's kind of weird, but an interesting feature. I do not like this feature. Why? Even when you select the option to have no delay when switching between noise environments, it is still delayed. You can turn off the beep if you want to that signals when the sound is switching to adjust to the noise atmosphere you're in. But I recommend not using this feature. Lastly, I had to figure out how to use voice assistant in conjunction with the touch sensors. I dont like Google Assistant and prefer using Amazon Alexa. I selected Alexa as my voice assistant and then my phone prompted me to select Alexa as a just once or always for this app. I selected Always which was a mistake. Before I can tell you why it was a mistake, you need to understand the touch sensors and how they work. The touch sensors are super cool and I use them frequently. The left earbud I have set to function as switching between noise canceling, ambient sound mode, and ambient sound mode off. It's as easy as tapping the sensor one time to switch between each one. If you have a co-worker come up to you suddenly and your music is playing making it so you cant hear them, all you have to do is hold your finger down on the left sensor to activate quick attention mode which forces your music to the background and instantly allows you to hear your co-worker speaking to you. Now, you have to keep holding your finger down to keep this activated and it does not pause your music just so you know. On the right earbud, I use the app to choose what I want it to function as whether it be voice assistant, Amazon Alexa, playback controls, or volume controls. There are several options to choose from and I like the variety. My favorites to use are playback controls and Alexa. Playback controls are wonderful. When you have this set to your right earbud, one tap pauses the music, two taps go to the next song on your playlist, and three taps make the song repeat. So, if one of your favorite songs comes on and you want to hear it again, tap the right sensor 3 times before the song ends to make it repeat. What's weird is the app tells you 3 taps goes to the previous song, but this is false. I tested it and all it does is cause the song you are listening to currently to start back at the beginning. Then, you can hold your finger down on the right earbud to activate voice assistant. Now, this is where I get frustrated with voice assistant. When I have playback control set to the right earbud, I do not want to have to manually touch my phone to lower the volume if my music is too loud. You would think the voice assistant could easily help by holding your finger down on the right earbud and telling Alexa to lower the volume. It's not that easy. If Alexa is your voice assistant, your phone screen must be unlocked to use it (only applicable to when you have playback control set to the earbud). Well, that's not very hands free now is it? To get around this, you could just set the right earbud to Amzon Alexa. When you do this, all you do is tap the right earbud one time and say Alexa followed by whatever you want her to do for you: increase or decrease volume, set reminders, tell you the weather, traffic update, flash briefing, etc. You can still do all these things when you use Alexa when the earbud is set to playback controls but your phone screen must be unlocked in order for the commands to get through. That wraps up all the negatives. I mentioned some positives in there, so here are some final takeaways. As of right now, I have found a comfortable routine at work when using the earbuds. The left earbud is set to control switching between noise canceling, ambient sound mode, and ambient sound mode off. I utilize quick attention mode when needed. On the right earbud, I always keep it set to playback controls. I accepted the drawback of having to unlock my screen to use Alexa because I only use her once every morning when I want to hear my flash briefing. When I'm finished listening to my flash briefing, I'll turn on my google play songs on shuffle and utilize the playback controls as needed. When I'm on break or lunch, I put the earbuds back into their charging case. The charging case is phenomenal btw. It holds up to its claim of maintaining a lasting charge. The app even tells you how much charge is left in the case so you know when it's time to plug it in. The charging speed is not a concern at all and nothing for you to worry about. The earbuds charge quickly like nobodies business, fantastic. By the time I get back from my break or lunch, the earbuds are fully charged. When you take the earbuds off, it automatically pauses the music. When you put them back on, it automatically connects to bluetooth but you have to press play again to get your music going. That's why I keep playback controls set to the right earbud so I can quickly start my music back up after returning from break. When putting the earbuds back on, it tells you the current charge level like fully charged or 50%, 75%, etc. Currently, I'm having to learn to utilize the quick attention mode more often and trusting it. Several times have I taken the earbuds out of my ears to hear a co-worker talk to me only to realize after our conversation that I should have used quick attention mode. By far, my favorite feature of these earbuds is the noise cancelation. I have noise cancelation mode on 90% of the time at work. It does not get rid of every single noise around you so you hear nothing but your music. That's not what it is intended to do so dont expect it to do that. Rather, it extremely muffles the noises of things around you. So much so to the point where the noisy chatter of the call center is transformed into a muffled background sound almost, akin to Charlie Brown and how the grown ups talk. I had a coworker walk up to me, didnt see her coming, and I turned to look at her only to realize her mouth was moving and she was talking to me. I had no clue she had started talking to me because noise canceling mode was on. That is amazing. Would I recommend these to you, a friend, coworker, or family member? Most definitely. They are always looking to update their app which is one of the great things about it. They listen to our complaints and update the earbuds accordingly. For example, just last week, they released an update to improve sound quality when taking phone calls using the earbuds so the caller can hear you better. Before I got the earbuds, there had been complaints about volume control among other things. They added this feature. There were complaints about not knowing the charge level of the case. They added the ability to see how much charge is left for your case in the app. So point of the matter is that it's an ever changing product that can improve itself with new features and updates to fix any issues. (I forgot to mention why it was bad for me to select Always when choosing Alex as the voice assistant. I had mentioned you have to unlock the screen to use Alexa when the earbud is set to playback control function. I wanted to test other voice assistants to see if they require the screen to be unlocked like Google Asistant for example. Because I slected Always for using Alexa as the voice assistant, I couldn't find my way back to undo that setting. I have a Galaxy S10 and googled how to change this setting but couldn't find out how to do it) It's a great buy! Lots of fun to use and very practical in a work environment.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-22,The best true wireless Bluetooth earbuds at this price range,"After owning or trying out several of the newest wireless earbuds, including those made by Shure, Klipsch, Jabra, Sennheiser, and Master & Dynamic, I had to crown these the winner, by a long shot, for multiple reasons: 1. The battery life exceeded the 6 hours during my testing, but I wasn't using the noise cancelling feature the whole time - perhaps it's rated for 6 hours with NC on? Nonetheless, I got almost 6 hours before it even warned me that the battery was at 20 percent, and after that I proceeded to use them for a total of over 7 hours! 2. The noise cancelling is probably the best I've seen so far in true wireless earbuds. I'd say it legitimately blocks ambient noise to the point where you can't even hear it, which is a first for me. 3. The fit and finish actually goes hand-in-hand with the noise cancelling feature - with 7 different sets of tips, you will get the perfect fit for your ear, assuring the best sound quality and noise cancelling. 4. The sound quality and clarity blew me away. I've never been a huge proponent of Bluetooth to begin with for this reason. The sound is every bit as good as units twice its price, and absolutely crushes everything else in its price range. I recently had the misfortune of trying on the AirPod Pro earbuds, and I can safely say that the Sony definitively tramples them in every category. They are so comfortable and sound so good, I've found myself wearing them at home, where I could easily switch to something much more intricate and expensive, but I just love the full, rich sound of these earbuds! It's as if the music is happening inside your head, on a whole new level. I can't recommend these enough - they really exceeded my expectations by so much - I'm a Sennheiser fanboy mostly, but I know what's good when I hear it, and these little earbuds truly deliver. I know 200+ is a lot to spend on anything, but if you can afford them, you will not be disappointed!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-24,This is the way,"Skip to the bottom for the basic review I've had these since Black Friday 2019. I purchased them at Best buy so I'm not a verified purchaser here but I wanted to help write a decent review here to help out. I love these things. I was going to purchase the 1000xm3's (the headphone version of these) but decided against it because I'm an earbuds kind of person. The batter life is amazing sometimes I go days without chearging the case and hardly ever use the earbuds until the point I get a batter warning. They last and charge very quickly. The design feels larger than the galaxy buds I had previously, definitely can't use these as much when I work cause I move so much but if I do end up needing to move fast I have no problems with them falling out anyway. Not designed for working out but can handle their own when needed. Sound quality A1 the best I've ever heard and have currently. The equilizer in the app gives so much customization control. They go everywhere with me no matter what and even with the large case it's still easy and doable no matter the outfit or occasion. The copper will show scratching and scuffs fairly easy but I don't care battle scares just show how well theyve handled being carried everyday the past 3 months With every update the software gets better and the perks just increase with added volume control now and improved call quality these things just keep getting better over time. Sony listens and improves what people want improved. The noise cancelation is the best you'll have in a true wireless form. Just be sure to insert the bud correctly and you'll hear and feel the difference. When I first bought these I was putting them in wrong and it was kind of painful to have them in for long periods of time but once I went through the manual finally I got it down and now I have zero issues. I find these to be the best true wireless earbuds on the market right now with the sound quality of senhaissers the batter life of the dumb airpods and the best noise cancelation in a very compact form.

The voice assist does not mention the device it is connected to which is extremely annoying as I have to find out where it is connected to. 2. The noise cancelation is decent. I use the bart and it drowned the noise quite a bit 3. The fit is horrible. It relies on you inserting them deep into the ear canal as the headphones are bulky and will fall off otherwise. This means that after an hour of train ride my ears were hurting quite a bit. I tried all the ear tips they provide and they all ended up hurting my ears after a few minutes of usage. YMMV. 4. The app is decent as long as it is connected. As there is NO MULTIPOINT connectivity it is useless once I switch devices. Returning them back for a full refund.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-30,Madre Mía—the Legends are True!,"All I can say is that I, like the many reviewers who have already posted, are thoroughly impressed with these new noise-canceling earbuds from Sony. Let’s start with the easiest. These things are visually gorgeous. The charging box in which they sit reminds us of the Sony of “yore” (is Sony seeing somewhat of a Renaissance these days? It sure seems so). The black and rose gold color combination is stunning, and the functionality of the charging box matches it. The individual earbuds fit perfectly in their holding spots inside the case, and are magnetically pulled and held into place. A USB 3 (thank you, Sony!) connects the charging case to the power source. The earbuds and the case are simultaneously charged if both are low, or only the earbuds are charged if the case is charged, or if you are using the case apart from a power source to charge the earbuds. Great design. Next, the comfort of the earbuds themselves is exceptional. I was highly skeptical that they would be either comfortable or stable in the ear, but I am happy to report that they are both comfortable AND easily stay in place. Of course, getting good sound depends very heavily on putting the correct size of the ear caps on the earbuds, so make this choice carefully. If you do not have the proper size on ANY earbuds, they will generally sound terrible. Again, Sony did well here by providing three sizes of two material types of buds so that you can get the perfect fit. Bluetooth connection is accomplished by a touch sensor on the right and left earbuds. You simply touch each simultaneously and the headphones go into connection mode. I had no trouble getting them connected to my phone. Both blue and red lights on the buds and on the charger signal charging, pairing, and connection. (It is advised to quickly look over the included blue-and-white instruction sheet to see the sequence of steps for each of these operations.) Sounds quality is very good. The headphones will not produce pounding bass, but with the right equalization settings, the correctly-sized earbuds, etc. Little practice, the sound is very pleasing. The signature is more-or-less flat throughout the range, with a drop in the lower end of low bass. However, there is still plenty of mid-range bass, and I find the speakers quite pleasant in the manner in which they accurately and clearly reduce the music. This part of any headphones is a highly personalized factor, but I can’t imagine anyone would be disappointed unless they are looking for something that turns out massive amounts of bass at all times. Finally, noise reduction. I don’t claim to be an expert, but I’ve been using Sony noise reduction systems for nearly 20 years on a variety of models with different headphones with great satisfaction (and before most people were even interested in noise reduction). There is absolutely no question that the noise reduction on these earbuds is beyond exceptional: it's almost unbelievable how well they work. As many people point out, they will not remove all voice noise (but will reduce it), but it’s the other noises—airplanes, fans, generators, cars, etc.—that these just handle with aplomb. To be honest, I did not expect them to be any better than my last Sony noise reduction sets, but they certainly are, no kidding. You have to hear them to believe them. This is a five-star item in nearly every respect. As people find out about them, they will become more and more popular.

After a day of listening and testing features, I can say that the WFs are inferior to the over-ears in every way except portability, ease of use during workouts and overall intrusiveness, as you might expect. That said, the WFs sound great, and anyone coming from a pair of low quality headphones/earbuds will love the sound and build quality. They are also far smaller than I'd expected. Noise canceling is not as complete as the over-ears but still damn good. I highly recommend having the companion app installed on your phone so you can make sure the settings are tuned to your liking. Connectivity is good but not perfect. On my 2015 Macbook pro I had some occasional stuttering, and the earbuds disconnected altogether from my iPhone 8 when I rejected a phone call. I have not had a chance to test in dense city. Battery life with noise canceling clocked in at exactly 4.5 hours, just as many others had tested. Perfect for a day at work (just pop them in to charge during lunch) or commuting, but not great for something like a long-haul flight. Overall, if you're looking for earbuds to compliment your noise canceling cans, these are fantastic, especially for the price. But if you're trying to decide between the WH model and the WF model and don't need the compactness of earbuds, opt for the over-ears.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2020-02-13,Great Sound But Certain Features Missing,"Edit Feb 27: Reducing rating to 2 stars. Connectivity reduce to 2/5 stars from 5/5 stars. I've experienced stuttering with the connection on multiple occasions. It's extremely frustrating and makes listening to anything unbearable. Added a rating for call quality, 1/5. If you're getting these to use to use for calls think again. It's really bad. Overall I'm very impressed with these. I'll keep it simple Sound = 5/5 The sound is excellent. Once you get a good seal with these (for me one of the sets of ear tips works great) the sound is rich and the bass is great. The headphones allow you to change the sound in the app based on what you want to emphasize (treble, bass, vocals, etc.). Battery = 5/5 The battery lasts quite a while for this style of earbud. So relative to this the battery is top tier. Comfort = 4/5 I usually have trouble with headphones and comfort. I will say these aren't the ultimate image of comfort I would have. I do notice that I have them in after a long time. My ears will bother me slightly, but it's not terrible. One of the better earbuds I've tried. Weight - 5/5 Weight is light enough that you don't notice them when you're moving around. Case - 3/5 The case is pretty sleek looking. I like that there's a magnet to help guide the earbuds into the case. The biggest downside is it's pretty big, so if you're keeping it in your pocket it might be annoying. I personally either use them at work or leave the case in my car if I know I'll be wearing them wherever I'm at. Call Quality - 1/5 The call quality is awful for anybody I talk to. Lots of background noise on the other end. Connectivity -2/5 Updated to 2/5. See edit at the top. Features 2/5: This is where I think these headphones fall short big time. I'll list the negatives. -You can't be paired to more than one device at a time, which is really annoying. JLab devices can do this, so it's disappointing a high end product like this can't. -This means that you can't access the sony phone app if you're connected to a PC, which is extremely annoying for me since they're mostly connected to my laptop. This means you can't check battery of the case or buds unless you disconnect from your PC to your phone and back. -There is no PC app (kind of falls into the last complaint), which is also really annoying, especially for someone like me. This means you can't even check the battery life without repairing them to your phone and opening the app. - You can't see the case battery unless you put an earbud in and take it out. I assume this is because the case itself doesn't have bluetooth. When you put an earbud in and take it out, it must save the last reading of the case battery life. Kind of annoying, but not the end of the world. -The touch features on the earbuds could be better. They only handle a single tap to action ratio. I'd love to be able to program double tap on both of them to program two more features. Overall I'll end up keeping them, because of the sound quality, comfort, and effectiveness of the ANC. But I hope they release a PC app and some of the other features I mentioned. I'd give them 3.5/5 if I could, but 4 I think is more fair than a 3.

I travel fairly often, but have never had a desire to carry a big case of over the ear ANC headphones in my backpack. For the past several years, I've been using the Phiaton BT220 NC headphones for noise cancelling. Good price, compact, wireless (sort of), and did a good job with noise cancellation. The only problem I had was they had a rather present hiss (across 2 pairs), so it detracted from the audio quality, which was ok at best. So I decided to look for an upgrade, and enter the Sony true wireless. The Bad (yes, the bad first, for a reason): The case is a bit bulky compared to other true wireless. Best performance requires the Sony App. They come with several pairs of ear tips, but for the most part they were all pretty sub-par. Comfort was not terrible, but they let in a TON of ambient noise. So much so that when airborne, I could barely tell noise cancellation was working. On a recent trip, I finally had a little extra time to pick up a set of Comply isolating tips. The difference was night and day! The only problem is the Comply tips I got were more of a universal style and don't stay mounted very well (in fact they stuck in the ear when I pulled the ear buds out and I had to dig them out). Waiting for them to get a size specific to the Sony posts. The Good Once you get a good set of tips, the noise cancellation is amazing. With the good tips, I would put it on par or better than any ANC ear bud, and quite a few over the ear models. Excellent sound quality with pretty good response across the spectrum (for ear buds), and with the Sony App, you can tweak them to your liking. Battery life is pretty solid of ANC true wireless. You can quick charge 10 minutes in the case and get another hour or so out of them. Case is good for 3 full charges. Comfort wise, jury is still out as I've only had up to 3 hour flights so far. Overall, these are turning out to be pretty great. Like most true wireless ANC earbuds, you're not going to get a 9 hour international flight on a single charge. But they charge up pretty quickly, so you can take a break to give yourself more time. Sound quality is excellent and noise cancelling is nearly unparalleled. Sony just needs to work with a company like Comply to develop some quality tips to include (and be available aftermarket) and these would be near perfection.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

You will, however, still be able to hear most sounds around you with the NC on. It's not perfect NC, I would describe it more as noise dampening. The cool thing with these is the Ambient Sound feature, which let's sound pass through the speakers so you can hear your surroundings better while still listening to music. Useful for jogging or other scenarios where you need to hear what's going on around you. I do wish they could have stretched the battery life to 8 hours, though. I think it's somewheere around 5.5 hours with NC on? You can recharge it pretty quickly with the case, but it's a bit annoying. Putting them in your ear is kind of wierd, basically you put them in vertically and then twist them to get them to ""lock"" into place. It just feels odd to me and it doesn't really stay in place. Sound quality is top notch. Even though the noise cancelling isn't the best, with NC on you can drown out all outside noises without having to turn the volume up super loud.

I also wanted something more compact than my Sony WH1000XM2 headphones. The 1000XM2's have gone on every flight with me and worked flawlessly for the past two or so years. They even worked at silencing and unhappy two year old during a VERY long 10 hour flight. Too bad they couldn't keep the kid from wanting to climb on me like I was a tree... Style / design is great. It's nice that there are multiple ways to fit these in each ear - except for mine. I must have the tiniest ear canals of any man because I could not get these earbuds to fit no matter how hard I tried. My wife tells me I don't listen to her, but I doubt that is because of any physical limitations. I could get them to stay in my ears, but if I shook my head hard they would have come flying out. What this means is that the noise cancelling was non-existent for me. The sound quality was only okay as well. I did a side by side comparison between these earbuds and my Sony headphones. I played the same series of songs at the same volume on my stereo speakers to compare the noise cancelling. I did the same with the t.v. to simulate background chatter. I then played two different songs on my iPhone to check the sound quality against the other. Using Sony's app, I kept the equalizer on the same custom setting. On every level, except packability in a carry on bag, the headphones beat the buds hands down. As I mentioned, I really wanted to like these, but no matter how hard I tried (without going to a hearing aid clinic and getting them custom fitted to each ear), I just could get these to fit.

I also use the following Sound effect: Tube Amp Pro (I enjoy the simulated soft timbre of a tube amplify opposed to the standard sound provided from the content being played, it helps the lower tones sounds have a bit more ""oomph"" The AKG N200's are a really tough act to follow as they're referred to as ""Reference"" earphones, and essentially what that means is that they don't have any manufacturer provided Equalization or Sound profile applied to them. They're meant to have a flat sound curve that attempts to represent the content in it's truest form and are seen as excellent assets for the use of Mixing sound. The main weak points I'm left wanting is a stronger presence in it's base for when I listen to EDM, but the sound stage is marvelous, clarity is amazing (Clearly defined highs, Mids, and Lows, without having the lows distort the highs). The bluetooth connection could also be better, but unfortunately it's a product of their time being limited to Bluetooth 4.1 rather than the current standard of Bluetooth 5.0. They're also a set of wired bluetooth earbuds opposed to TWS, with a standard 3 button remote (Volume Up, Action Button, Volume Down) WF-1000MX3-------- Initial impressions: Opening the box, the presentation was great, Earphones were separated from the charging case with a wide array of ear tips to make sure you get the proper seal for the best possible quality of sound. User Experience through Sony Connect: Pairing with my phone did take a couple of attempts, I downloaded the Sony connect software and attempted to use the NFC pairing (just for use of it's novelty, but it failed to pair) Went with the standard bluetooth pairing method and the Sony Connect software immediately recognized the TWS Airbuds, +1 point for ease of use. Sony connect software seemed pretty function filled, and thankfully as soon Sony connect interfaced with the Earbuds and saw that there was an active internet connect, it prompted for a firmware update, which adds further usability to be able to change the functionality of the touch buttons (it adds the software update to allow volume control - ABSOLUTELY NEEDED Function). With the software, you get your basic controls, and get to view the individual power of each earbud along with the last recorded power level of the charging case that updates when the earbuds connect to your device. The power levels do jump around in vague percentages (i.e. 100% -> 70% ->50% -> needs to be charged) so at least it provided some update, but not the most accurate.) Here you also get the ability to control your noise cancelling and cycle through the following settings (Noise Cancelling -> Ambient ->Ambient Control -> Noise Cancelling again) And you also get to change the options of allowing the headset to guestimate your current activity and turn on what would be the programs best option for your current activity (If it detects that you're walking it will turn on Ambient to provide spacial awareness of your surrounds, if you're sitting it'll turn on Noise Cancelling, etc.) Personally, I prefer my hardware doing what I want it to do when I want it, so I turned this option off. You also get a pretty cool equalizer option with some useful presets, my preset mainly resided within the ""Excited"" option, Speech (Listening to podcasts, youtube presentations, Audible, etc.) or custom, which was simply the ""Excited"" with the Bass option turned all the way up. A fun integration of the application where it provides playback control of whatever media you're currently using, and a Volume control. Interesting Note*** I found in trying to keep the maximum sound output for the earbuds, that I turned off ""Absolute Voulme"" for my phone, and this volume slider provided the earbuds their individual volume, and then the phone volume became the Master Volume. I did this to not have to deal with HUGE upsteps in volume control when the device synchronized the earbud volume with the master device volume. Next option was choosing your priority for connection, if you want to prioritize the best sound quality vs. a stable connection. There are several other options available the main option of note is the ability to change the functionality of both the Left touch button and the right touch button. This was great, but disappointing at the same time. It gives the options to cycle through controlling the following: Ambient sound control, Playback controls, Volume Controls, Google Assistant, None Assigned) So if you want to operate within those parameters, it's great! One set of functions per parameters set, and your off... It's disappointing if you wish to create your own custom commands for the different control types (I.e. Single Press, Double Press, Triple Press, Long Press) It felt like a lost opportunity for consumers who want to pack more usability into their controls... maybe some day it may be updated through firmware updates, who knows! Sound Quality: I found the sound to be rather lack luster regarding the quality of sound, at least regarding all of the high level of praise that has been given to these TWS earbuds. I went through, created the individual adaptive sound profile for the hardware, enabled the same advanced option for the Tube Amp Pro and listened to the flat equalizer settings for the device. As expected the through put of sound was very flat. There is a definite increase in the vibrancy depending on the equalizer preset that you choose using the Sony connect software, Excited mode had come high recommended and I immediately found myself going for the option, and the difference is pretty great! Found that flat lows are now producing a sensation of actual base feeling inside of my ears (that resonating you feel inside of your ears which those wonderful notes) but I did notice that unfortunately, the highs were muddled. I have my standard songs that I go through dedicated for sound testing, the ones where I know the minute details that I know to keep an eye out for because I've listened to them for so long... and unfortunately, the highs got muddled a bit. There isn't the distinction of which instruments are playing which notes with clarity. It was a definite let down, but I figured that at least I could enjoy the bass... until I decided to go back and forth between my AKG N200's... and the difference was clear as day. With the distinction of vibrant, sparkly highs, and greatly resonating and punchy base, I noticed in multiple of my absolute favorite songs that I can listen to endlessly while listening to my N200's simply flattened out and became run of the mill and lack luster when listening to the WF-1000XM3's. Again, this doesn't mean that that sound is by any means bad... but it most definitely isn't a reason to upgrade my current daily earphones, especially with a high price tag of $200+ when my daily's MSRP'ed at $149.99 (which for myself I waited for a sale and picked them up for about $80 + Tax) Battery LIfe: The battery life was great, just as advertised! For me, I had the earphones in practically the entire time, when I wanted to isolate and focus on the content, I threw on Active Noise Cancelling and enjoyed the sound for what it is, continuing to tinker around and trying to optimize. One of the positives for sure was using the ambient settings, allowing me to keep the earbuds in, but essentially using them as hearing aids, and being able to respond to conversation or contact in the different locations I was enjoying my earbuds (Work, Home, Traveling, talking a walk, etc.) Using the AKG N200's, I have become accustomed to having 1 ear bud in and keeping the opposite ear open for spacial and environmental awareness. That was a great feature that I did enjoy, but since Ambient mode uses the exterior microphones to pick up your surround sounds and plays the sounds through the driver, it is consuming battery. But with the quick charging feature, 10 minutes of charge provides over an hour of usage, so the feature is DEFINITELY appreciated! Adding the extra charge of 18 hours from the charging case definitely makes these TWS ear buds a stand out if you happen to know that you wont be around an AC port for more than a couple of days! One complaint that I do have regarding the charging case is that it is pretty large. It uses up a considerable amount of pocket space if you don't have any kind of bag on you while traveling or doing the day to day tasks. The stand alone battery time is great! But in terms of being a definite reason to upgrade from my current daily set... Not really. My AKG N200's have a battery run time of 8 hours after years of usage handles all of my daily requirements until its about time to call it a night, which I've become accustomed to charging them nightly. Noise Cancelling: For the size of the earbuds, I feel they definitely did an incredibly commendable job with Active Noise Cancelling in these little guys. Did it block everything out? By no means, but for having the portability of TWS earbuds it's great I'm not sure if it was placebo effect from knowing that the noise cancelling was on, but it felt like there was a definite increase in the quality of the music and sound playing while ANC (active noise cancelling) was turned on. One note*** when the earbuds turn on, the default to being in ANC mode instead of ambient or turned off. Under the ambient section of Sony connect software, you can change your level of pass through sound between 0 (ANC on) to 20 (All sound coming through) BUT there is a very useful little option that is right next to 0, and that is used to reduce wind noise... WIthout a doubt the most useful section of these controls regarding Ambient sound! Unfortunately, this is also the biggest reason for the single star review of these TWS earbuds. When playing media content, the ANC, and Ambient controls work like a charm, they're even fun to go through, but while making or receiving a Call... The earphones default to ""AMBIENT"" with the pass through being dialed up to 20. I thought that the ambient control could be controlled through the Sony Connect software, but it completely failed to make a change. This was a definite breaking point for me, because the entire selling point of these ear buds are to... ACTIVELY NOISE CANCEL, and they refuse to Cancel any noise while trying to make a call. Especially at a price Point of $229.99 MSRP, this kind of oversight is unacceptable. And it would be one thing if Sony had no clue this is an issue, but there are literally hundreds of people that have complained directly to Sony regarding this issue and it has gone for months without fixing. I went through every single possible fix that I could find to attempt to resolve the issue, factory resetting the Earbuds, messing with every single option, and to zero answer from Sony, there is no sure fired resolution. Sony packed a ton of tech into these impossibly small devices, but being unable to make sure that one of the primary functions of these in regards to being connected to a Cell Phone device becomes unusable, To make phone calls, is a bit of a critical miss that pushed me to forego this tech. Especially versus my tried and true current hardware.

And its ANC works great with the customizable ear tips. Though, If you'd ask me the gap between the sony's wf-1000mx3 and airpods pro in terms of sound quality, the gap isn't that big. In terms of compatibility, on the box it emphasizes it's made for iphone, but the more I used it, the more It felt like it's made for androids. The connection is not as smooth as I thought it would be. And it doesn't update its battery status often that leads to surprising the user with low battery notice. Also, I'm not sure what drained its battery life so fast, but it only lasted 3 hours of usage with the ANC on from 100% battery. Fit , it's not stable.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-02-21,Terrible call quality and bluetooth connection. Do not use for audio calls period.,"Battery life seems to be the best on the market, but I never used the earbuds long enough to really test it out. Sound quality for standard audio (playing music) is on par with a decent pair of headphones. As many other reviews are saying the call quality is horrendous. It is actually bad in multiple ways. First, the Sony Connect app turns up the gain and drowns out your voice. The Sony software engineers behind this app made the absolute worst decisions possible, completely ruining the sound quality without sufficient options to fix it. The profile that the app makes you use makes you seem like you are at the bottom of a well while amplifying all the noise around you. People I spoke with thought cars were crashing due to the noise from my dryer over 50 ft away, yet could not understand what I was saying. If you do try these out, do yourself a favor and do not install the Sony Connect app; just pair with your device normally through Bluetooth. Call sound quality improved from worst imaginable to standard without the Sony Connect app. The problem on top of this is that the Bluetooth connection is very shoddy and drops in and out. Despite having a new iphone sitting less than 3ft away from fully charged earbuds, the connection was choppy and my voice reportedly repeatedly dropped out on the listener's end. Swapping over to a wired set of earbuds (and to PXC 550's over bluetooth) fixed this issue. Things sounded okay on my end, but every caller I dealt with complained about the audio quality and forced me to switch (they strongly preferred speaker mode on my phone; thats how bad it was). Personally the ear buds were pretty uncomfortable in my ear, but your mileage will vary here. Bottom line, these are really not worth bothering with, even if they were half of the cost. I know that many Youtube reviewers claim these things are the best on the market, but they must have not tested the voice calls over Bluetooth enough and focused more on specs and music playback quality. If you are looking for something to handle calls with, you will be disappointed no matter how low you set the bar.

After reading reviews and having this on my wish list, I finally pulled the trigger and bought these. I was not impressed. These earbuds were a downgrade from the Galaxy Buds that I was using. Sound Quality The sounds was crisp for the highs but really felt empty towards the lows. When compared to how the range felt with the Galaxy Buds, I felt there was a huge gap. Tweaking the EQ in the Sony Headphones app barely made any improvements. My impression is that this was possibly due to the form factor of the earbuds. The Galaxy Buds come with different size rims around the outer part of the bud that seemed like it sealed the sound in and secured the bass. Fit Numerous times the Sony Earbuds fell out of my ears. I tried the different caps to try find one that would fit, but not really felt seated in my ear. With the Galaxy Buds, I never felt like the earbuds would fall out. In most cases, I actually like I was peeling the Galaxy Buds out of my ears. This was a good thing. They were secure. Ambient Sound and Noise Cancelling This was kind of the final push for me to go back to the Galaxy Buds. If there is a fan, or something that has a slight hum anywhere around, the ambient noise would pick it up. Fine, I turn off the ambient noise. That's kind of a waste of a feature, but whatever. With the Noise Cancelling, because the earbuds never really fit in my ear totally, noise cancelling was mostly just a muffling of the sound. Also, instead wooshing with the fan, I got a low rumble in the earbuds. When I turned off noise cancelling, that low wooshing stopped. Calls/Use/Battery Life The battery on these Earbuds is less than half of the Galaxy Earbuds. I got numerous complaints from people when I was on conference calls about not hearing me or hearing extraneous noises. I had to shift to a wired headset. When listening to music, the Left earbud would drain faster than the right. And when taking them out, it was possible to turn the music back on by accident, even though the auto off was turned on. The App UMMM... There was some calibration tool and some sound adjustments that didn't really make a ton of sense. I played with all of them to see if there was some sort of setting to give me the best experience. My feeling is that you shouldn't have to spend that much effort to get a clean consistent sound. It felt like there were features for the sake of features. It even had a player. I didn't hate these Earbuds. It was just not up to what I expected with the spectacular reviews and my prior experience with my Galaxy Earbuds. Anyway... I'm going to the Galaxy Earbuds Plus+.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I've made sure the firmware is up to date, but that didn't help at all. The sound quality is only slightly better than my Beats in-ears. It's a good thing these come with 7 different sizes and types of in-ear padding because it took me forever to get the right fit so they wouldn't just fall out of my ear if I moved too much. But even then, the noise-cancelling is only so-so, there's no way to get a good enough seal to be truly noise-cancelling. You can also only customize the tap-controls to an extent. There's a list of things the headphones will allow you to do, but you can't mix and match from that list. You can't control noise-cancellation, play/pause, AND volume at the same time, even if all three theoretically had different gestures. Each ear only lets you pick one type of control, and you can't add or subtract from that type's given list of abilities. Hopefully they'll fix this in a future firmware update because it is unnecessarily restricted.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-29,Beats Apple AirPods Pro....,"There are some very good, in-depth reviews already posted, so I don't want to duplicate what has already been said. I am a dedicated Apple devotee, except when it comes to earbuds. Having spent hours comparing the WF-1000XM3 with the Apple AirPods Pro, I stuck with Sony. Why? 1. The noise cancelling is better. 2. The sound and fidelity is significantly better - I'd say a good 25-30% as a rough judgement. 3. Apple does not have a dedicated app that enables numerous adjustment - almost as good as Jaybirds. 4. AirPods Pro will only work with the most recent iOS and MacOS so I could only use them with my iPhone 11 - not my iPad or iMac, but they did work with my Apple Watch. 5. Sony's touch functions are way easier to use than trying to press the smaller AirPods Pro stem. In my opinion Apples earbuds while good - are not better than the Sony based on the criteria above in a direct comparison using them side by side. As a disclosure I also own the WM-1000XM3 over ear headset. While their noise-cancelling is a little better than their earbuds, I think the sound quality of the earbuds is better. Sony has been in the professional sound studio equipment business for decades, and I can't help believe that this give their sound products an edge.

However, there are a few reasons I returned them and got the new AirPods pro (which are way more worth the exorbitant price). These are by no means cheap at over $200 and the noise cancelling works albeit not as good as the AirPods pro. I went through all the tips of which there are many like soft padded ones and standard rubber ones. The app for this is probably the worst I have ever used and frequently crashed or froze and would not provide information or not recognize I had the headphone(s) in. I say headphone because normally I use only one at a time and this meant that I would not have access to the application as it would think I had none in. The sound was clear with a good amount of bass but even after a couple of days was weak and not loud at all, even having a hard time keeping up when I was running down a busy highway. I want to note that I have a larger tragus and these were downright painful after just a little bit of tune because the front of the headphone pressed down hard on it just so I could maintain a good seal. No matter how I turned it it always ended up pressing hard on some part of my ear. I hope this helps some people as I wanted to love these but with the bulk of a huge case, overly large size of the headphone pressing on soft body parts and causing pain, a terrible application and sound that did not boom I would not recommend these for anyone looking for anc headphones. The AirPods pro are an example of the best of these kind and just work, small form factor and easy to use app interface.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-03-05,Not perfect... but very good,"I purchased these Sony earbuds in anticipation of a long airline flight, where the noise-cancelling feature would be useful and welcomed. I previously owned a set of second generation Apple AirPods, but decided to replace them with the Sony product. In addition to the noise cancellation feature, I also wanted longer battery, as well as faster pairing with multiple devices. I'm not disappointed. The Sony's noise-cancellation ability is good; not quite as good as, for example, a set of Beats over-the-ear headphones... but as good as can be expected. I like the ability to select a mode where external sounds are incorporated. The battery life is quite good; I don't get the advertised '6 hours with noise cancellation enabled, 8 hours with noise cancellation disabled', but it does come close. I'd say it's good for 5 hours or so, with noise cancellation on. Furthermore, when the batteries run low, a voice announcement informs me... but the earbuds continue to operate for another half hour or so. This performance is much better than the Apple AirPods they replace. Pairing is actually better than the AirPods. I use these earbuds both with Apple devices (iPod, iPhone), as well as with a generic Bluetooth transmitter connected to my TV. The Sony earbuds connect instantly with the Apple products... but they also connect much faster to the TV Bluetooth Transmitter. I don't find them quite as comfortable as the Apple product, even after optimizing the fit with the set of differently-sized ear tips that are provided... but this is a minor quibble. The recharging case is pretty big.... not exactly the kind of thing you'd want to keep in your pocket... but it's a small price to pay for long battery life and rapid recharging.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The sound quality was good, clean and clear for this purpose. They are a little bigger than I was expecting. I couldn't get them to fit right and feel comfortable in my ears. I tried every combination of the different sized included silicone ear adapters. I just couldn't seem to find one that held them securely in my ears. Although they only fell out once, they always felt like the were going to fall out and I was always trying to push them deeper into my ears to get a better fit. All ears are different but despite all my attempts, I just couldn't get them to fit and feel correct. Maybe because of the fit, I was less than impressed by the noise cancellation. I wore them on a couple of four hour flights. The noise cancelling was there, you can tell the difference when it's turned on verses just having the ear buds in your ears, but it is underwhelming. The noise cancellation is the main reason I paid up for these but I was disappointed. I have a cheap pair of over the ear headphones that cost way less and work just as well, if not better, at noise cancellation. If you are buying for this feature you may want to reconsider. Phone call sound quality was adequate on both ends of the conversation. Battery life was ok, I got about 5 hours per charge which is pretty good, not all day good, but pretty good. The included case has about two additional charges in it but it's pretty large and cumbersome to fit in a pants pocket.

The over-ear model (WH-1000XM3) has been a go-to headphone choice for traveling folks like me. I had the expectation that this product would be the same as the over-ear model, and I was wrong. The comfort is awful. It feels like my ears are being violated by the tips provided in the box. Also, if you don't get the ""right"" fit, the noise-cancelling is useless, which is 90% of the time. One earbud is just right, no matter how I stuff the other, it won't work right. Once I got into it, I discovered that it only provides SBC and AAC listening. No Hi-Res listening like the over-ear model. That DSEE-HX Is an upscaler, which is like taking a 720p video and watching it on a 4K TV. It's not good. For me, LDAC on the original model made it very appealing. The tapping-based controls of the headphones are unresponsive compared to the over-ear model. The ""mandatory"" headphone app doesn't allow much customization with the gestures (I want noise cancelling to be on a double tap on my left ear, but I'm not allowed change that.) Finally, the earbuds disconnect from my device during charging. I have to take them out, wait for the reconnect, then use them. It's infuriating when I just want to listen to some music. It's the small things that add up to making a bad product. Sony's over-ear model provides LDAC, good NC, and comfort. It has physical buttons for NC, Ambient noise, and power, with simple controls that are extremely intuitive. This provides none of that at two-thirds of the cost. Don't buy it.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2020-03-27,I should have stayed with My Bose Quiet Comfort,"I'm having a hard time with regret over these. Three weeks ago, my second pair of Bose QC 30's began falling apart. A little annoyed at the quality of the workmanship on them and my previous pair, I decided to look elsewhere. Most reviews on the WF-1000XM3 earbuds are thru the roof with praise for the design, sound quality and noise cancelling. Now, with my QC 30's, I could connect to both my phone and my tablet, and switch between them with a push of a button on the headset. Few earbuds I looked at supported multiple device connection, but the WF-1000XM3's listed that as a feature. Great. Those were the buds for me. What the reviews, packaging, support site, youtube videos etc. didn't say was that while you can connect to multiple devices only one is ever really connected. They say only one is active, but that's misleading. Only one Ever is connected. To switch devices, you have 1. have both devices in your hands 2. log into both device A 3. go into BLUETOOTH settings 4. Manually disconnect the headphones 5. login into device B 6. Go to BLUETOOTH settings 7. Manually re-connect to the headphones 8. Wait for the earbuds to catch up. These steps were not present in an Google searches I performed, weren't in the product literature, and weren't in any of the youtube videos I watched. To get them, I had to contact support and go thru all sorts of time-wasting do-this-first support steps (reset the device, reconnect bluetooth, verify software version, etc. etc. etc. etc.) only to finally get the answers above after almost half an hour on the support chat. Sorry SONY, but that doesn't qualify as multiple bluetooth device support in my book. That's not even a work-around. That's a kludge. OK, so I'm annoyed over that. Take a deep breath, lets test the noise cancelling and sound quality. Oh. My. God. Really? People are raving about these? The sound is tinny or fuzzed. I played with the equalizer and found nothing that sounded good. Maybe I've been spoiled by Bose, but the noise cancelling on the WF-1000XM3 doesn't come close to what I had with my QC 30's. They're not even in the same area code. As I write this, I'm wearing them. I have them set to Noise Cancelling on and set to MAX thru the app, Adaptive Noise Control turned off. I can hear myself typing with the same volume with Noise Cancelling on or disabled. Wearing them while grinding coffee this morning, I could not hear my music. I wore them as I took my trash to the curb. I heard every bird chirp, every step I made, and the rumble of my trashcan wheels. As I closed the garage door, the rumble of the door cancelled out my music. Sorry, but that's noise cancelling in the wrong direction. And yes, SONY Support, I tried each of the different sized silicone ear pieces. The ones I'm using are as good as it gets. And yes, I have Adaptive Sound control turned off, and noise cancelling MANUALLY set to Max. And yes, I have the latest software, and Yes, I did a factory reset, and yes, I did clear it from bluetooth and re-add it. I have to wonder about all the positive reviews. Either SONY gave a lot of these things away as review incentives, or people have never experienced real noise cancelling. My advice: spend the extra $50 and get the Bose QC 30's. WF-1000XM3's are not worth the money, time or aggravation.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

(when listening to music!),"Have been using these with a couple of iOS devices (iPhone 8 Plus & iPad Air 3rd gen) and am very happy with the audio quality for music. The headphones & iOS devices all support Bluetooth 5.0, so range and connection has been very good, and Bluetooth AAC streaming so audio quality is quite good to my middle-age ears. No idea how well they'd perform with an Android phone using Bluetooth AAC - YMMV? And yeah, about that: There's no AptX support, so AAC is the best Bluetooth codec available, making these fine for use with iOS devices but maybe not so good for use cases not involving AAC over Bluetooth. Overall, these headphones have a sound profile not unlike nearly every other pair of Sony headphones I've owned (MDR-V6, MDR-CD1700, MDR-1RBT, MDR-1000X), which is mostly flat with some low bass boost. Pairing these with my Macbook Pro (Catalina 10.15.3) was a nightmare. I had no idea what the SOC codec even existed until that unfortunate experience, only remedied by Toothfairy which was able to enforce an AAC connection after my time-consuming attempts to poke at the OS Bluetooth system runtime configuration failed. SOC is apparently used for telephony, and because the WF-1000XM3 has a microphone the system treats it like a phone headset rather than audio headphones. It's unlikely I'd ever use these with a Macbook Pro (usually have wired headphones at my desk, or some wired earbuds in my laptop bag), but I had to try. No regrets on my purchase, and I tend to use them often during the day as they're unobtrusive, sound great, and pair & connect easily with my 2 iOS playback devices.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I didn't notice much static sound with it on and it lowered most constant noises significantly (microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher and fans). 4) The sound quality was good, I wasn't blown away but it was better than my old earbuds Cons: 1) The fit can be tough to get right, you'll have to try multiple tips several times and play with how far in to go and how much to twist them into your ear 2) My wife had a tough time getting them to fit at all, I joke that she has tiny ear holes and I guess Sony would agree because these didn't work well with any eartip 3) My wife also heard a constant running water sound when the noise cancellation was on. Possibly due to a bad fit but could just be frequencies I can't hear 4) Battery life seemed really low, after a software update I was getting like 2-3 hours tops with noise canceling on. Before the firmware update I got 4-5 5) The deal breaker was connection issues. On my TV (or computer) sitting 6 feet away (or less) I would get one ear dropping sound every 2 minutes or so. If it wasn't dropping sound then both buds would make a garbled sound which was like a few milliseconds of sound being dropped every half second. I could still mostly understand what was going on but it was terrible to watch like that. Other times I would get a delay from one ear to the other so it was like a constant echo. For anyone that wants more info on the connection issues, I didn't have any issues with my phone at all. With the TV and the computer I also had some times when the connection was solid the whole time so it seems like it's not a hardware issue but something in software. Also I did send back the first pair hoping it was a defect but the second pair had the same problem (both on the original and updated firmware). I also had a pair of over ear BT headphones that I started to test on the TV when my connection would have issues with the earbuds, I never had any connection issues at all with the over ear headphones so it doesn't seem to be a interference issue.

After watching and reading multiple reviews I set myself up for a bit of disappointment. Although the reviews were all positive there are a few things I did not anticipate when I started using them. This is the first Bluetooth earbud I have ever used so I can’t compare to any other products. Wired earbuds yes, and I have tried a pair of Airbuds a family member has for about 3 minutes. Definitely not a substantial amount of time to use as a comparison. I have a Note 10+ phone and was thinking of trying the Samsung buds at first. I was more excited about the Sony’s for the noise cancelling features. I went for the Sony’s just for that feature more than anything else. I’m not a hardcore music junky so sound quality was not a issue in my buying discresion. Pro's The noise cancelling feature is fantastic. I work in a manufacturing plant with 35 machines making noise all day long. I sit with my back to a wall which reverberates the machine noise. Our operators use compressed air to blow off parts repeatedly every few minutes. Pop these bad boys in and they tune out around 90% of the sound. For this reason I will not return them. The only things I noticed it could not noise cancel were random sounds (rain, forklift beeping and high wind noise). Sound quality is quite good. The preset EQ is tuned very well and I'm sure you will find one that suits your desire. They feel and fit good in my ears. Light weight and do not move around or slide out during the course of the day. I do not run so I can not say they would stay in while exercising. Battery life is acceptable and they charge up very quickly. I wear mine for around 6 hours a day. During lunch I charge them and they seem to be good for the rest of the day work and my commute. Con's Spotty connections. It is a bit annoying to hear them drop out a few times an hour. The drop only lasts for 1 second but still, I expected something better. Microphone is horrible. I'm on the phone a lot during the day. Almost everyone complains they can't hear me clearly in the shop environment. When I go outside with less noise people still have a hard time hearing me. No volume control on the default setting. You can change that in the app but at the loss of other functionality. I seriously wish there was a sliding touch sensor along the bottom side to adjust sound. It is a pain to have to grab the phone to control volume. If you listen to music at a low level and receive a call, I have to pick up the phone to bring the call volume up. If you have the music louder and a call comes in, the ringer is very loud in your ears. You can adjust this in the phone system setting easily enough but I find it inconvenient to have to turn the ring volume back up when not using the earbuds. Button location is large but not exactly where my fingers naturally go. I tend to have to try and find it on the second attempt. I want to touch the front of the earbuds but the button is near the back. Seems a bit awkward to me. Connectivity to some non standard devices has been disappointing. My computer has Bluetooth so I thought it would be cool to get sound from it to watch Youtube or a news video during my lunch or break. Well, sadly it will pair but my Bluetooth seems to only be for file transfers. I can not get sound transmitted in Windows. I can buy a dongle to solve this problem but I would rather not. I was really disappointed when a Sony product could not connect to another Sony product. If you think pairing these earbuds with a PS4 would be the best... sorry they are not supported. Again, I can buy some dongles to ""MAKE"" them work but who wants to do that? Sony not supported by Sony? What's up with that? The case is a bit large. I think the design could have been refined. Seems like there is a AA battery in the bottom of the case to give you an idea of what I think should have been sized down. Additionally the lid could have been thinned down as well. The last annoying thing. When you take a call it deactivates the noise cancelling feature and puts the earbuds back into ambient sound mode. This is frustrating to say the least. I want to hear the caller and not the outside sounds. I have to assume this is a safety feature so you don’t get hit by a car while walking. I would prefer it stay in noise cancelling mode but that is just my opinion. Last thoughts. Would I recommend them to a friend? Probably not. I would recommend trying some other brands. Maybe ask a coworker or friend if they wouldn't mind letting you test out whatever they use.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07T81554H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

As with most earbuds, the bass is faint, the mid is 50/50 and the high end is great, but it is not particularly well balanced. There's also an extreme lack of overall power. With everything turned up all the way, there were still movies I couldn't watch via tablet on a plane even with the noise cancellation. My plug in headphones worked fine. The Bluetooth is frustrating in general. The headphones must be unpaired with one device in order to connect to another. Meaning, if you were using them with your tablet, and now you want to use them with your phone, you MUST unpair with the tablet first or they're useless to the phone. This is irritating as I don't always carry my tablet around. Battery life seems good, charger pack is cool, but it's finish will scratch and degrade easily. The built in microphone for phone calls is fine if you're in a quiet place, but even basic room noise is noticed by those I speak with. They are not useful with sports, running or cycling in particular. Any wind or breeze creates significant static chaos making them worthless in this environment.

The charging case feels nice and high quality, built with high quality materials and feels sturdy. The charging case however is very bulky and not something that can be carried in jeans pocket when you step out. The bulky charging base provides more charges on the go, but would be nice if I had option of choosing a larger or smaller size case. The earbuds are on the bulky side but are lightweight and comfortable to wear for short periods of time, but get's uncomfortable over longer periods of time. The sound quality and bluetooth connection is great and did not have any issues while listening to music. Pairing the earbuds to my phone was also a breeze. The ""Headphones"" app gives the flexibility to choose the sound signature that suits you the best and works great, it also lets your customize various other features of the earbuds. Noise cancelling and ambient modes work very well for earbuds this size when you are indoors, like in a room or commuting. However, its a completely different story outdoors, the external microphone catches a lot of wind and you will hear buzzing sound through the earbuds when noice cancelling or ambient mode is turned on outdoors. You will hear this even when its not windy outside, just walking is enough. Let's talk about call quality. All my calls were clear and person on the other end could hear me well, but I always hear a lot of static noice when on a phone call and would expect a better experience with high end earbuds. Battery life of the earbuds are good and as advertised, I was able to get 6 hours of mixed usage with ambient mode and noise cancelling. The charging case provides 3 extra charges which is great and sort of justifies the bulky charging case Touch controls on the earbuds work great. These are not physical buttons but touch pads on both earbuds and are very sensitive and easy to use, having touch controls is great since you don't get the feeling of pushing the earbuds deep inside your ears every time you touch them. Left ear buds control the ambient sound and noise canceling which worked every single time for me. Right buds control pause and play and skip tracks which also works really well. The right buds can also be customized for volume control depending on your needs.

I've gotten a good 4-5 hours with continuous playback of videos and with Active Noise Canceling on high but when turned off, you can get 1-2 hours more. The buds themselves are very well held by strong magnets and the cover is well designed that the buds will not fall out if held upside-down. Nicely done Sony. A small length Type-C cable is provided for charging but any decent cable will work. The case itself will give you about 3 charges. And with only a 10 minute charge you can get about 1.5 hours of play. Just open the lid and it will start the Bluetooth pairing for you to find and connect on your device. If you have an Android device with NFC you can just touch them together and voila! You can connect to 2 devices and switch between them. To connect to a 2nd or another device touch both buds for about 7 seconds. They work right away with or without the app (Sony Headphones Connect). But you will be able to do more customized settings with it. They do have a Touch interface so one will control the Ambient Sound/Voice Assistant and the other one Playback. Also if you touch the Ambient side, it will let you hear the outside sound as long as it's being touched. Ambient features works really good. It adjusts your sound according to the level of noises in your surrounding. They do work with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri. I've used both Android's assistant but not with Siri yet.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-28,Sony WF-1000XM3 Headphones are a Game Changer!,"The first thing you’ll notice is how perfectly contoured and comfortable they are while wearing them. Sometimes I forget I have them in, I’m not exaggerating! The second thing that struck me was their ergonomic design. They are lightweight but durable and sturdy in the hand. The charging case was larger than average but that’s because they’re packing 32 hrs of juice on a single charge of the pack! With my Sony WF-1000XM3’s I’m getting around 7-8 hours of playback at a medium volume. The promised 90 minutes of playback after 10 minutes of charging is a true claim, I was very happy with that! Sound: The Sony Headphones Connect app is available for free on iOS and Android, this app unlocks so many additional features. I was blown away at the level of control you can get if you want it, there is an equalizer that controls the tonality of your music and podcasts. You can achieve warm or bright styles of sound with the tap of a button in the app. Performance: Because of their light weight these headphones simply stay put, they always seem unaffected by my movement. Wireless headphones with 8+ hours of playback runtime are unheard of, but Sony does it somehow. Forget about distractions because these puppies will drown out virtually everything around you, the various noise cancelling options can be changed on the fly using the touch panel on the ear bud, simply tap to cycle through the different default settings and customize them in the app if you’re a control freak like me. Your ears are unique to you, Sony includes 7 pairs of various sized ear bud tips with different material qualities. This vital accessory is always an after-thought so I was happy to see that I had options. The different types of tips also changed the characteristics of the sound in my experimentation, I found the squishy type tips provided a better seal in my ears and improved the treble, bass effect and comfortability. If you’re currently vacillating between different ear buds and the Sony WF-1000XM3, go for the Sony pair. I honestly don’t think you’ll regret your decision after hearing and feeling them in your ears. I’ve purchased many popular “high-end” brands of headphones, I wasted so much time on them before landing on this Sony pair. They were all nice but their fit left very little to be desired. The sound quality is simply phenomenal and the noise cancelling tech is bar none the best I've experienced.

Most ear buds are too heavy, fall out easily, or do not fit correctly and hurt my ears. Not these! They were super lightweight, and came with multiple sizes of ear bud tips, which meant I was able to find a set of tips which fit my ears perfectly, making them comfortable and preventing the ear buds from falling out. I unpacked the WF-1000XM3's and let them charge for about 20 minutes. I was too excited to go longer; I wanted to try them out and see if they were as good as advertised, and I was not disappointed. After downloading the app and making sure they were connected to my phone, I put them in and wore them while taking a walk. The sound was impeccable and after awhile I almost forgot they were in! When I returned home I placed them in the charger and let them fully charge. Lately I use them more days than not, especially with being at home due to the pandemic, and on average, I will get 7-8 hours of use from them before requiring a recharge. I am a student and these are great to use to block out my children when trying to listen to videos for class.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-30,"Best Headphones I've ever used, sound quality +","I wanted to try these out since Sony is known for good products. I've had other headphones in the past, so this was something I could compare to. Upon opening the package, I seen the charging container and the ear buds (not in the container). Then taking these out I came across extra ear buds plus the charging cord and manual (which you'll need to get setup). So, first thing is you'll notice the headphones don't sync to anything until you out them in the case to activate, then you can start the sync process once they've been removed. I love how it tells you L or R so you know which is which. Once in you install the app on your phone and follow the prompts. The coolest thing is it you have to take pictures of your ears so it can then get the best listening experience based on your ears. This is something no other headphone has done, so this was intriguing. So, once that's done you can go thru the settings to see what sounds good to you. I loved how you can hear the difference when sitting, walking, in a car and running. The Ambient when in the car was the clearest. I couldn't believe how clear this was and how you can hear others too when they were talking. Now when I was in a room and someone was talking, it was hard to hear them. Once I switched the ambient function off, you could tell a huge difference in hearing background noise and people talking. It's crazy how much of a difference this makes, but just knowing you have those options is even better. Also, you can adjust how much ambient is done by adjusting the bar. So, I tested out the sound with certain music types it literally sounded like I was in a Music Hall. It was amazing. My other headphones don't do that, so this was a pleasant surprise. So, one thing that's a really nice feature is the built in Alexa voice control. I used this to ask what the weather would be like then asked to play certain songs. This is one thing my others didn't have and it's been so convenient. Just to be able to run or go walking and use this function has been a blessing. The battery life on these is by far the best I've ever seen for headphones, 24 hrs! This means you can use them during the day without fear if the battery running down. So, after hearing the difference between normal and the ambient sound, Sony has outdone themselves with these headphones.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-30,Perfect for focusing on the music,"I have owned many Sony headphones, from basic earbuds to studio monitors. The WF-1000XM3 has quickly become my favorite given its fantastic sound quality and adjustable noise cancellation. I sought these headphones primarily for music enjoyment, and Sony delivered. I was surprised when I first listened to the WF-1000XM3. Never would I have guessed that wireless earbuds could sound this good. Noise canceling works really well, with even loud noises becoming almost silent. The headphones present a warm, laid-back musical experience with an emphasized, punchy bass-end. It’s a great combination for listening on the go, producing a dynamic sound that doesn’t fatigue the ears. My favorite feature of the WF-1000XM3 is customizable Ambient Sound Control. It’s truly an impressive feat to dial in exactly how much of the outside world I want to hear. Especially useful is being able to activate “focus on voice” when I’m in a noisy place but still need to talk with people nearby. Music listening is where these earbuds shine, but they can handle phone calls when needed. In addition to sounding great, the WF-1000XM3 feels great thanks to the bounty of 14 included earpads in several different sizes and materials. I easily found just the right pair that fits securely in my ears without excess pressure. For iOS and Android devices, Sony’s Headphones Connect app manages the noise control, sound equalizer, and other features of the WF-1000XM3. It may not be flashy, but the app is straightforward and gives quick access to every setting on one scrollable page. Even without its app, the WF-1000XM3 paired easily with other gadgets (and even my PC), offering the same noise-free listening experience for any Bluetooth-enabled device. Overall, the Sony WF-1000XM3 is easy to use, sounds amazing, and offers excellent noise cancellation.

I picked up two sets of these in a recent trip to Tokyo (one black, the other ""silver"" which is more of a putty color). The noise cancellation is, as one might expect, not quite as powerful as that found on Sony's over-the-ear WH series NC headphones, but it is pretty close- perhaps 85% of the WH capability- but a lot more convenient to have with you at all times. On the busy streets of Tokyo, noise simply disappears- replaced with the ""thump"" of one's own steps going through your body. Signal strength never wavered- the connection remained rock-solid even in some of the most RF-saturated places on the planet (Shibuya scramble crossing and Shinjuku station, for example) greatly outperforming the previous model. Video sync was excellent on both iPhone and iPad for movies downloaded to the device, but there was slight lag while watching Amazon Prime Video streamed items on my iPad Pro. I got every bit of six hours listening to music from an iPhone on my return flight. The touch controls are a little bit fiddly, they are actually perhaps a little too sensitive (as in, they tend to activate when making minor adjustments to fit, for example). Sound quality is flat and natural, and easily adjusted if desired with the Sony app. It was, subjectively, more detailed than the previous model. The main feature these lack compared to the over-ear models is the altitude correction function on the over ear models isn't available on these. No matter, they were still 80% as effective in NC as the over ear WH models. The case is not a burden in a reasonable pocket. It easily provides three or so recharges. All in all, this is a 9 out of 10 effort.

I want to hate these. I've spent the last 10 hours with them going back and forth between using them with a phone and trying to get them to work properly on my laptop paired with an intel AC9560 wireless card (BT 5.0). The major pros of these head phones are the sound quality when they are used properly. Listening to them with my iphone xs max has produced a quality experience I was lacking when I solely used my apple airpods. The noise isolation and ambient inclusion features are done well, by in large, tho some latency between activing and de-activating these does leave one to want to change it on off less and less. My biggest issue has been using them with a non-mobile device. Windows will not allow you to disable the microphone. The microphone stays hot the entire time its connecting to a laptop making the audio quality drop to 92kbps (tape quality). Not to mention the ambient noise that floods in from the hot mic. I went through every ounce of possible troubleshooting, even turning off the headset and microphone services. None of this works, it's simply not compatible with a windows PC. Mac users, rest better assured that you are able to turn off the mic independently and get your audio quality back, however, it seems that on mac once you do this, you are very limited by the amount of volume they put out. Something to know that has not been covered by any mainstream reviews. Connection to the iphone has been flawless and effortless. It paired immediately, and connects disconnects upon entrance and exit from the large charging case. The video latency is still an issue with iphones. This is more noticable if you are streaming any service. If you watch downloaded movies / music videos on the native player for iOS, it seems that it is, at the very least, compensated for and has less to now lag - no perceivable lag that is). All in all, I'm going to do some more testing to see how to bypass this microphone issue on windows.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-08-02,Not the Best In This Segment,"Sony is aiming for the higher end of the market with these wireless earbuds. So what am I going to do? Compare them to a pair sub $100, Bluetooth headphones. Any set of earbuds at this price should crush earbuds that cost less than half. Which ones will I be comparing? Skullcandy Push https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N2B3HRP OnePlus Wireless Bullets 2 (only available from OnePlus) Hopefully comparing these three will expose areas where you get more or less for your money. 1 – SOUND SONY – Excellent sound. Some of the best I’ve heard. It’s accurate. Skullcandy – Great sound. They are very dynamic. Not as accurate, but they impress. OnePlus – Great sound. They cheat though. If you own a newer OnePlus phone, there is a setting for these specific earbuds. They truly optimized these to an extreme degree. Others phones will get this experience. WINNER – By a small margin – SONY 2 – FUNCTIONALITY SONY – They do a bunch of stuff. They have a half baked “ambient” mode. It’s half baked because all it does is let you hear some things in the background. You still can’t really carry on a conversation without taking the buds out. They are the only of the three that has active noise cancelling. It’s not just ANC – it’s ANC so good I’ve never seen this quality in earbuds. I’ve seen it in over the ear, but never in something this compact. These use touch (not button) controls. They automatically shut off if take one out, and start again when you put it back in. One MASSIVE thing missing – there is no option to control volume via the touch interface. You have three options for each ear bud. They can be – Controls – ANC / Ambient – or Google Assistant. How is volume missing there? How is that not an option? I think it’s safe to say that just about everyone changes the volume more often than use assistant. Both of these earbuds connects via Bluetooth. I mention that because most wireless ones connect one and then beam one to the other. Skullcandy – No ANC, but these have a tight fit, which reduces noise. They have a button on each ear. Using combos of pushes, you can skip forward and back, trigger assistant, pause / play, and change the volume. Only one ear does calls, which is a little annoying, but not a deal breaker. OnePlus – You can volume up, volume down, play / pause, trigger assistant, but – you can only skip ahead. I don’t understand that. These also have a bizarre power system that you’ll love or HATE. There is no power button. The two earbuds are magnets. If they are connected, they are off. If they are apart, they are on. This causes issues when traveling. They can easily pull apart and connect your phone. WINNER – By a slim margin – SONY – they could have crushed this one, but no volume controls is a really dumb thing to leave out. BATTERY LIFE SONY – Six hours, if you don’t use some features. Then you can put them into the case to charge up. The case will charge them a few times, so SONY claims 24hrs. Skullcandy – Pretty much the same as SONY. OnePlus – 16hrs. Straight up. WINNER – OnePlus. DESIGN and COMFORT SONY – They give you six different tips you can try. I played around with them and ended up with the default. I can’t really call them comfortable, but they are not uncomfortable either. They are more bulky than I’d like. They point forward when you are wearing them. They feel pretty solid. They fit a little loose. There is no hook or good form to keep them in your ears. I have not had them fall out yet. Skullcandy – Very comfortable. Possibly the most comfortable earbuds I’ve every used. They use a little hook that makes them feel solid in your ear. This is something SONY should have thought about doing. They are a decent build, but it’s all plastic and they do not feel as solid as the SONY ones. They point up when they are in your ear. OnePlus – No hooks to secure them. They feel okay. Better than the SONY but not as good as the Skullcandy. Like the others they give you a bunch of tips to try. These are a more solid build than the Skullcandy, and they are formed to fit into your ear a lot better than the others. The big drawback here is the wire. The two ear buds are connected by a wire. This is how they get their amazing battery life and it you will never worry about losing one. If you want truly wireless, you’ll want to skip these. Where these look more like conventional earbuds, they have less of a d-bag factor. People who always have BT headsets in their ear have earned that rep over the years. WINNER – Skullcandy. SONY could have won it, but they didn’t do enough to separate themselves. You don’t gain anything here by paying more. I can’t say OnePlus lost here, they are just different. CASE SONY – The case is bigger than you’d expect. Once the earbuds are in there, they are not really easy to get out. Skullcandy – Smaller case, easier to get the buds out. It’s still too big for my liking. It’s much bigger than Apple’s case. OnePlus – Dear OnePlus team who created this case – YOU SUCK! This is god awful, steaming pile of poo, case. It’s a silicone oval with a magnet to close it. It’s not easy to cram everything in there and then, most of the time the earbuds come apart. WINNER – Skullcandy – not much of a win here. It’s a very low bar between these three. VALUE SONY – Let me put it this way – You gain ambient mode and ANC. You lose volume controls. You pay nearly 3X more. No water proofing for that extra either. Skullcandy – Both OnePlus and SONY offer better sound. It doesn’t win many categories, but it doesn’t really fail in any. They are also the cheapest of the three and, unlike OnePlus, they are truly wireless. OnePlus – Ten dollars more than the Skullcandy. They have much better batter life, but are not really wireless. WINNER – Skullcandy. VERDICT If ambient sound and ANC are a must have for you, and cost is not really a factor – buy these. If you are concerned about getting the most bang for your buck – buy the Skullcandy. If you own a OnePlus phone and don’t mind (or actually appreciate) the wire – buy the OnePlus. OVERALL In the end it’s really hard to recommend these earbuds. If the case was smaller, they had volume controls, and they were more comfortable, I’d recommend them. The problem with this price point is pretty simple. People are expecting the best. You need to be the best. You can’t make mistakes. Sure these are coming in lower than their rivals in the high end market, but the lower tiers offer a far better value. If I’m willing to pay for earbuds at this price point, I’m going to buy the best. These are not the best in this category. UPDATE #1 11/26/19 A huge update was released. You can now control the volume on the headset, Alexa, was added and more. One full star bump up for this. Some of the most annoying issues have been addressed. UPDATE #2 12/4/19 I've had some time to really work through the recent update. I'm convinced that Sony is just an update away from being the hands down winner in the high end segment. Right now they are not because their controls are awkward. Want to turn up the volume? Single tap the ear you mapped in the app. Want to turn it down? If you've used other earbuds like this, you'd be tempted to double tap. Not Sony. You have to hold your finger on there. It's awkward and inaccurate. Right now you are stuck making one sacrifice or another. You have to pick two out of the four functions (track nav, profile, volume, and assistant) to use. The others cannot be used. It would be a very simple matter to have them all available. If Sony were to program the following, these would be killer. Ear 1 Volume up = 1 tap Volume down = 2 tap Assistant = Hold Ear 2 Skip ahead - 1 tap Skip back = 2 tap Switch profile - hold If they release something like that, I'd be willing to give these 5 stars. Side Note: Sony also updated these with a 360 Sound option, that scans your ear and gives you HD audio. Only catch is it's only useful for three (at the time of this writing) rather expensive, subscription music apps. Beyond those it does nothing.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

If you are expecting to use them in an extremely loud environment probably stick with overears. The software is a little wonky. The only other buds that have compared sound wise are the sennheriser ones. I returned those due to not being able to listen to one at a time. A huge deal breaker for me. I almost thought you couldn't do it with these either. When I would put one back in the case both would turn off. Now it works though, I didn't do anything other than try it a bunch of times, I guess the software figured it out. The sound without EQ is decent. As far as EQ, I didn't really like any of the presets as a set and forget it. The ""excited"" preset is good for podcast but adds too much noise for music. Bass boost is fun, Sony's ""clear bass"" setting is really nice. I would encourage use of the manual EQ, turn the clear bass up to desired sound, turn down the 1k setting a few notches, leave 400 and 2.5k where they are and raise the 6.3 and 15.6 k to what sounds good.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-02,Best wireless headphones! Noise canceling optional,"I’ve purchased many (expensive) wireless headphones over time, as I listen to audiobooks nonstop. These are my favorite pair I’ve tried. They are slightly larger than earbuds and have a soft changeable silicone tip of various sizes (very similar ear tip to bose headphones). You have to play Goldilocks and find what tips work for you as far as the ear part for what fits best out of ones they give you. The case is larger than earbuds (about double the size). Theres a round button on each ear that works in single tap, double tap, triple tap, tap and hold on either R or L headphone for different functions. Examples of these functions are noise canceling on, ambient noise, pause, play, fast forward, rewind, call answering, and a few more. This is useful if you want to do stuff just by touching ear and not finding phone in purse or walking back to it on a charger. I did accidentally pause things when fiddling with my ear and hair more than once but just need to get used to this feature I think. There’s an option in a Sony headphones app to turn on or off the feature that the headphones will stop automatically when you take them out. There’s a helpful one page quick start directions w pictures that just sort of tells you how to charge them in its case then pair them to your iPhone. I’m NOT the tech savvy one in the house who does computer setups, but I was able to set these all up by myself with no help. The case and the headphones themself have lights on them that I’m still figuring the colors etc out. When you drop one on floor it lights up blue so you can see where you dropped it. The noise canceling worked to drown out all the ambient noise around me (dishwasher, lawnmower, distant television, etc) but it didn’t work on voices of anyone talking near me. I think that means they aren’t AS noise canceling as the over ear headphones one might use on a flight, but these are so much more compact. I LOVE that the noise canceling is optional and just a tap turns it off and on. There’s so many times you don’t want the noise canceling (crossing street, when watching kids, in a dark parking lot, when you think somebody is talking about you at work, etc) so it’s great to pick and choose when to use it. The battery life is amazing. I was listening for hours and didn’t need to charge them. You get a few charges out of the case once it’s charged too. They give you a cord that has a usb end to charge them up so you will need a wall plug to usb to charge them or a usb outlet somewhere. My ONLY complaint is this charging cord is soooo comically short (about the size of my hand) that even plugged into a kitchen counter outlet it just hangs there bc it’s too short to sit on the kitchen counter. Had to move books over to boost it up to sit on while it charges. That’s such a minor personal peeve that I’m still rating it 5 stars. Very pleased and highly recommend.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Design wise they're gorgeous. If you're sitting still and right next to your phone, the sound quality is beautiful. But that's about it. A test at the gym (don't dare to sweat though, because they're not sweat / water resistant) summed it up. Virtually nothing north of mid-bass or maybe 600Hz felt like it was being reduced at all. That's wildly different than my 2 year old Bose (wired) in-the-ear noise canceling earphones and it's lightyears away from Sony's own over-the-ear models. In those models, flip the noise canceling switch and your ears experience that awesome altered state where the sound pressure changes and the outside world fades. Not here. At this price, they barely performed better than my TRANYA $40 set of in-ear earplugs I usually use at the gym (passive noise canceling from plugs only). The $40 Tranyas are sweat proof too, much lighter, have a smaller case, smaller form factor and longer battery life. Pairing it with an iPhone wasn't fool-proof. Sometimes it paired and sometimes it didn't, requiring me to select it on the iPhone or turn it on / off or put it in/out of the case. Sound quality is gorgeous, especially if you select sound quality vs. connectivity (set through the app). I did that, but in a basic gym workout of doing squats with my phone in a side pocket, the signal would cut out or one ear would stop working. I couldn't believe it. I tried using it as a way to meditate while others were in the room- it really doesn't cut the voice frequencies out in a pleasurable way. The rest of the features (like activating ambient sounds) are forgettable if the primary function is mediocre. So they're going back just 3 days after I got them. It's all hype I think. Yeah some people will buy them because the DO look cool and why not. But performance-wise, the don't come anywhere near my wired noise canceling Bose, and for wireless, at $229 they don't offer enough to compete with my tiny, water-resistant Tranyas. The Sony gets tiring to wear, the Tranya does not. I wish this was one of those ""I liked the product so much, I bought the company!"" reviews but instead it's ""Oh wow this thing is gorgeous but doesn't deliver in the least and is going back.""

My first thought when I saw the case was ""seriously?"" These are not clown-show big, but definitely in the ""holy cow"" range. I have a pair of inexpensive truly cordless earbuds, and the case is about twice as large, and these are also about twice as large as the Apple Airpod case. The next annoyance is that the case is rounded on the bottom. I like being able to put the case on a flat surface then take the ear buds out simultaneously and plonk them in. No can do with the rounded bottom unless I balance it against a vertical surface. Finally, getting these out is tricky. It's not like I have big ""Andre the Giant"" sausage fingers. I'm a guy with smaller hands and I still have a hard time getting these out. OK, so enough with the case issues. The earbuds are FANTASTIC! Sound quality, particularly bass, is significantly better than the other 6 pairs of true wireless earbuds I've tested. The controls are easy and intuitive. Comfort is excellent, mainly beacuse they have 4 sizes of silicone tips and another 3 comfort foam tips. The comfort foam seal sound better but actually don't seem as comfortable as the silicone. Size isn't bad and the silver color is fairly discreet, compared to even ear-commas (airbuds) Sound isolation as a result is excellent. Active noise cancellation is so-so, compared to full-size bluetooth noise cancelling headphones, but then again, power consumption and noise processing is probably size and power limited, and the overall combined effect is comparable to ANC headphones, though earbuds being what they are, without the size or the long-term comfort of headphones. There are 3 sound modes - ANC,, Ambient Sound and Ambient Sound Control Off. - with Ambient Sound you can still hear everything well, just with your music overlaid. With ,ASC off, you get ~20% longer battery life. Earbud controls takes a few tries to get used to the.touch-sensitive pads. It's easiest to use your middle finger to tell where the front of the bud is before using your index finger to control. Pairing was simple - NFC is enabled on the case, though I ended up just pairing normally and then loading the app. No issues, Battery life is impressive. Take them out for a few minutes and you're back to nearly full. I've been using them about 5-6 hours a day for the past 4 days and have never fallen below 50%.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-06,Amazing sound quality... no seriously... mind blowing.,"I have IQbuds and Bose Hearphones, so a bit of experience with high end noise cancelling headphones. The sound quality of these playing on my phone is astonishing. First time I've had an ear bud that could do serious staging and bass! Not shake your body bass obviously, but it is beautifully reproduced. Let my son try them out and he was blown away. The noise cancelling is as good as my Bose Hearphones, maybe better than my IQbuds. Connection is way better than the IQbuds along with the sound quality. As a noise cancelling ear bud Sony has concentrated on that rather than the tricks of hearing enhancement my other earphones have like directional concentration and environmental aware noise reduction. Only downside I can say is that first time I tried them out was on my Win10 desktop computer... sounded AWESOME! That night my computer did a major windows update and now they are not recognized as headphones, just as a voice headset and the sound quality and connection is horrible. I tried everything I could find to fix that, it is NOT a Sony problem, it's freaking Windows. On my phones it works great although for some reason I could not get the app to load on a borrowed Iphone5. I wore these for hours at a time and NO discomfort. But the warning is that these are NOT waterproof in any way. If you have the money and sound quality is what you are looking for with the ability to block out everyone around you really well without big bulky headphones or a bar around your neck... hit the Buy Now button. Let my son's friend try these with his Android to see if he had any connectivity issues... connected right up and the app instantly knew they were on and took control. App works well. Reason I mention him is that while listening his mouth kept dropping open and he was mumbling ""Oh Wow..."" ""Oh Wow..."" and let me know he could not hear anything outside of the earphones with the ambient sounds off and noise cancelling on. With the app allowing conversation he could hear me perfectly well. Then he loaded up some serious bass and could not disturb them and was as impressed as I was. Followed up with a clip designed to demonstrate 3d sound called ""Virtual Barbershop"" and he was just astounded as he listened. I did not know what he was listening to until he handed them back to me and I listened to the clip... HOLY SH#&! There is a guy playing a guitar off to your left and a bit behind you that you'd swear was coming from the tv in the other room... the stereo imagining was perfect as a guy 'walks' around you trimming with clippers and scissors. You can almost feel the clippers against your neck.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-08-06,Software Can't Keep Up With Hardware,"Sony's new Noise Canceling WF-1000XM3 excels in gorgeous product design and hardware, but falls flat with their software counterpart. Upon first use, I was in love with the matte texture of the case and minimal earbuds, however, over the course of the next week, a lot of the faults within Sony's software became too large to ignore. The biggest issue is the bluetooth pairing. Coming from Apple's AirPods which paired magically every time, Sony's WF-1000XM3 would take a good 15 secs to connect via it's own app. With most of the physical controls missing from the earbuds, you're forced to use the app to adjust anything and over the course of a week, I realized how much of a burden this became. 15 secs might not seem that long, but try just staring at the black screen of your phone and count to 15 secs and you'll see what I mean. The second biggest issue is that the each of the earbuds would connect to different devices! I had left earbud connect to my iPhone and my right to my MacBook. I basically had to factory reset the 1000XM3 (which is not very obvious) to over come this issue. All-in-all, Sony really needs to step up their software game before shipping a product like this out the door. I'm sure Sony will eventually push out firmware updates, but my Bose headphones and my AirPods never encountered these kinds of issues because the software was very polished from day 1.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-08-06,Cool Product,"Overall, these are pretty cool earbuds. Love the wireless function. I will never not enjoy a wireless device. Totally eliminates the need to have my phone on my person, which is awesome. The app that you must download for this is very handy, gives you a full overview of the battery life, what audio is playing, the connection and different audio settings. You can adjust the quality of audio depending on your preference, including the noise cancelling options. It's also nice that I don't have to worry about turning them on and off myself. They're pretty smart, and they know when they're in your ears, and when they're taken out. Put them back in the case when you're done, and they maintain a charge for days on end. The battery life is pretty fantastic. They also come with several different types of domes for the buds that are inserted in your ears, to make it easier to choose your own level of comfort. Now, for the cons. I really wanted to love these, but there's just a few too many inconveniences to make these my favorite set. One, they're supposedly not waterproof or resistant? A pretty dangerous combination for completely wireless earbuds. I have cheaper ""wireless"" buds that, while not as fancy, at least are sensibly designed to be resistant to water and moisture. That is a concern for me. Another thing, the instructions were not exactly dummy-proof. There are still functions I'm not certain of, nor even how exactly to control the volume without the app. They're very sensitive to touch, yet I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the ""volume button"" would be on these. Lastly, I took these to the gym at work today, which has no service, mistakenly assuming these would connect to my phone or the excercise machines regardless, like my cheaper pair. Imagine my annoyance when I couldn't get them to connect, or even show up! So I had a music-less, audio-less workout today, begrudging my decision to bring these with me. So, as you can see, pros and cons. A neat toy, but not perfect. There are plenty of cheaper and sturdier options online. These are probably nice for people that enjoy smart tech, but if they don't give me exactly what I need, I don't really care how cool the app or touch-sensitive siding is.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-08-07,Wow... just... wow...,"First off, these sound great. How great? This is maybe all you need to know. With other sub-$100 wireless earphones I've used (about a half-dozen or so), I can not tell the difference between a 128K and a 256K AAC stream from my iPhone 8. With these I can clearly hear a difference between those, so I'm storing less music at the higher bit rate on my phone. I haven't listened to a few different things to make an assessment. Music I was very familiar with. Peter Gabriel's ""So"", Steely Dan's ""Aja"", Grace Jones' ""Slave to the Rhythm"", Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and Bruce Springsteen's very magical new album ""Western Stars."" I also checked out a couple big loud superhero movies. I'll likely not use these for movies, as I don't like watching movies on my phone, but they work well for that, too. They can be a teeny bit finicky to set up...but this is a GOOD thing, because you have control over these that you don't have with others, thanks to Sony's app. Know that the ""Clear Bass feature"" needs to be turned up (to about +6db imho) to sound right for rock or pop music (leave the rest of the EQ alone). Also, imho, for best listening, turn off adaptive sound control and turn on ambient sound control, leaving noise canceling ALL THE WAY OFF. Also, mind-bogglingly, when my app updated, it reset a few of my controls so I had to go in and change them again. VERY minor annoyance. Finally, experiment with the very generous array of ear buds that they give you. Finding just the right pair (they might be different for your two ears, btw) is key to getting the sound right. I find them comfortable to wear for a longer period of time. The charging case is a little big for a pocket, and the actual units are bigger than you might guess from the photos, but you get a full array of ear buds that will probably fit any ear you can imagine. So, why not 5 stars??? Simply put, I can't give 5 * only because of the price. In fact, normally I would only give them 3 when they are this expensive... but I have to give them 4* because they are so amazing sounding (once you get them set up). This is too much money for most people to spend on something like this. If you are the person for whom it is not, you will love these. As you may notice, I got my set free, and personally would not likely have spent my own money on it. This means when I'm going out somewhere, I might find myself carrying my cheaper set, afraid that I might lose these somehow!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-08-08,Brilliant sound but precarious fit and absolutely zero noise cancellation,"The ""noise cancellation"" was so bad that I returned the first set I received, thinking it was defective. The replacement had the exact same problem: the 3 levels of noise cancellation are exactly the same: No noise cancellation whatsoever. Not that it matters much, since all 3 levels are the same... but when you tap the left earpiece to change levels, it occasionally announces which setting you have chosen, but 9 times out of 10 it simply beeps and changes nothing. I wanted wireless, noise-canceling earphones to dampen traffic noise when I walk along the street. My Bose, over-ear phones are wonderful for both sound and noise dampening, but they are awkward and hot in the summer. I also have Bose, in-ear phones that are wonderful for noise canceling, but the cord and control switch leave much to be desired. I pre-ordered the Sony WF-1000XM3 based on ""expert"" reviews that made them sound like the perfect solution. As you can see, I was disappointed. Regardless of the size of the earpiece tip selected, the shape and weight of the units make me feel they might easily fall out while I am walking. The iPhone app is very smart and useful and the ""tap the earpiece"" functions to skip or replay songs work fine, but, unlike my Bose units, there is no built-in volume control, so I have to pull out my phone whenever I need to change the volume. Also, callers complain about ambient noise from the Sony microphone, unlike their experience when they call me on my Bose headsets.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-08,Lived up to the hype and reviews.,"I assume if you're about to drop $200+ on buds you've been doing a lot of research. So I'll jump in with my experience and then comment on some of the common pro/con talking points and add some of my individual experiences. PROS -Sound! These are top notch (as advertised), I'm a basshead and the bass on these is a nice deep rolling bass that hits at all ranges with a nice punch at the proper frequency! The bass doesn't feel ear damaging like I've experienced on others that just play loud...Bass is very crisp/clear/on point. Sony's EQ app does a great job for personal preference. -These buds are surprisingly comfortable for me. I usually struggle with buds staying put but these fit perfect, after a bit I forget the are even in. They aren't heavy, seat close to my head and don't stick out too much. -""Silver"" color is more of a matte/dull light grey. Attractive and Sony branding is classy/subtle. -Case is a nice matte finish and houses them perfectly. I see ppl complain about the size but it's about the size of those XL tic tac cases and holds 3x charge. A little bulky but not cumbersome in pocket. -Technology...Noise cancellation is amazing for earbuds! Better than my Bose over ears. And I love the long press to allow ambient noise in for conversation or w/e (music continues to play at very low volume). Everything stops if you take a bud out and reads power level to you when placed in ear! Sony's headphone app is a must for customization and sound control. I found ""EXCITE"" to be my favorite EQ setting. Buds blink blue when out of ear, great for locating them when set down, they DO NOT blink while in ear. -Battery life is great so far. Just as others have mentioned. -Connectivity is very fast and easy. -Handsfree calling is nice. When asked, people said I sounded clearer than when just on phone (I tend to mumble away from the mic) CONS -No hands free volume control. Even via google assistant, I tell her to lower volume and she tells me it was done but volume remains the same. I did not take away any stars b/c this is common for earbuds, just hoped Sony added this to their groundbreaking tech. -No Qi charging...I common complaint, bu I honestly don't see a big deal since I have both Qi and usb-c chargers throughout my house. -No charge level indication of case, only full or not. Would be nice if at least 4 LEDs to indicate battery level. -Touch pads are seated back further than ear hole, takes some getting used to to tap further back to use commands. -Sony isn't clear about their level of water/sweat proofing. -In Sony's Headphone app, when you scroll through the EQ settings- it stops/switches sound at each setting. Hopefully w/ and update you can scroll to which setting you want and press to switch to it. -Price. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. OVERALL These are my new go to's for sound! They are not cheap but if you are in the market for high-end buds, IMO the best out there. Their noise cancelling and sound are top notch, comfort level is the best I've experienced. You get a great daily bud that can serve as an airplane/transportation noise cancelling...The only question mark is for working out, I am comfortable in doing so as I am not a super sweaty guy. Even mowing the lawn was fine with these (although I purposely tried to avoid touching them with sweaty/dirty hands). But if working out was your main use for an earbud, you are most likely better off with something more waterproof, durable and maybe over the ear hooks.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-08-11,The Best Totally Wireless Earphones you can buy today,"I've been a fan of totally wireless earphones, but found myself always going back to traditional Bluetooth earphones due to issues such as audio/video sync, sound quality, poor fit, or (lack of) features. I own a number of Sony earphones and headphones, many of which have active noise cancellation. I think Sony does not get enough credit for their noise cancellation and how well it works. The moment I unboxed the WF-1000XM3, I was anxious compare it to my current favorite, the Beats Powersbeats Pro. The Powerbeats Pro actually fit my ears (unlike Apple AirPods), are fully in sync with video on iPhone, and admittedly I like the sound signature. For comparison, I also have the Bose SoundSport Free, and while they also fit and I enjoy the sound, audio/video sync has gotten better but still is not perfect (the YouTube app on iOS is a prime example). So, I charged up the WF-1000XM3 and gave them a whirl. First off, as is usual of Sony they include multiple size eartips in two different sets; both in Hybrid Silicone and Triple Comfort forms. Getting a good seal is extremely important for earbuds and I appreciate all the options. Connecting them to iPhone was uneventful, especially since I'm already familiar with the Sony Headphoens Connect app. One oddity is that it always takes a few seconds for the app to connect to the earphones, even while actively using them. With the app, you can adjust the level of noise cancellation, view battery level, and adjust sound equalization and/or Clear Bass settings. Each earbud has a single touch-sensitive button that can be used to play/pause music, or switch between noise cancellation settings. How do they sound? Great! I really enjoy the sound signature of these; to me they're comparable to the PowerBeats Pro if not slightly better in overall quality. For me, the fit is actually more comfortable long-term, and audio/video sync is perfect, even in the iOS YouTube app. Battery level is reported to iOS so you can see it in the Sony app, or in iOS itself including the Batteries widget. The noise cancellation works great; I will retire my Sony Wi-1000X for airplane use and see myself using these more than my PowerBeats Pro as well, if for nothing else, the smaller battery/stroage case. The only improvements I could see would be to have some sort of IP certification, and to add aptX and LDAC support for the best possible sound on Android. Perhaps the XM4 will address that gap, but don't hesitate to get these as they are truly the best totally wireless earphones you can buy today.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

A LOT of people are experiencing (including myself) either the left or right earpiece to sudden drop connection and stop charging at all. For these people this can be fixed by placing both ear pieces back into the charging unit and placing fingers on both the touch pads of the earpieces for about 10 to 20 seconds. Keep your fingers on them and then you'll see them begin flash and don't let go until you seem them stop flashing completely. This is a factory reset and will restore full functionality to both earpieces..but in my experience, this is a temporary fix. Don't let this discourage you from considering these earbuds though.

Portability key feature.,"Update 2019-Oct-09 The headphones work consistently now (was inconsistent during original review).. turning on and pairing when I remove them from the case. When removing from my ear they pause and resume when returning to my ear. This is nice and useful. I have come to intensely dislike the haptic controls on each earbud. Almost every single time I would put the left ear in the noise cancelling level would toggle. It was so annoying that I used the Sony app to turn off all controls on the left ear bud. Talking on the phone, the microphone performance is now consistently poor so I have stopped using these altogether for phone calls. Overall still nice sounding and noise cancelling ear buds in a small package. Haptics.. bah. Original Review. Sitting in a noisy environment, the Sony earbud’s noise cancellation (NC) definitely helps a lot, the issue is that my 3 year old Bose QC35 full size headphones do much better at NC. I’ve tried multiple earbud ends to see if a different size would create a better seal to improve the noise cancellation. No success. High pitched sounds like crickets at night seem to be a big problem for the Sony earbuds. I can still hear them with the earbuds and not at all with the Bose. When music is playing, the environment is drowned out completely. So perhaps the convenience of being able to carry the earbuds in my pocket whenever I need them outweighs the improved NC of a full size set of headphones. I have had mixed results with phone calls. The sound is great and most of the time the caller can hear me well. But, sometimes I have callers frustrated because the microphone is working poorly.. even in a quiet environment. The dreaded “I can’t hear you well”. The earbuds themselves have been a bit glitchy. When they arrived, the right ear was fully charged and the left ear was dead. It wouldn’t charge or show any life. I had to go through the tiny print in the fold out manual (seriously, stop with the tiny, poor manuals) to figure out how to completely reset the earbuds. Not an intuitive process. When I did that, the earbud started to charge again and worked. When I remove the earbuds from the case, 95% of the time they come to life and find each other. Several times one or the other doesn’t connect (usually but not always the left). This happens the most when I take the earbuds out of my ear, set the, on a table for 15 minutes, and then put the, back on. Reconnection and pairing is spotty. The only thing to do at this point is to put both back into the charging case for a moment, then take them out again. This seems to always resolve the issue. One drawback with Sony current products is that, while the earbuds can be paired to two devices, they do not switch back and forth like Bose products do. This is an absolute must if you are listening to music on a tablet and the phone rings and want to answer the phone with the earbuds. I am confused as to why Sony hasn’t addressed this feature which I consider to be critical. The sound truly is very nice. Not as nice as my full size Bose headphones, but very nice for something so small and easily portable. This makes up for a lot of the little annoyances. For a portable, always available, noise cancelling device.. these work well. I think they could work better.

I have a pair of Master & Dynamic MW07s with Comply Foam tips to compare against. I also have a recording I made during a flight on a 737 of the background noise that one has to cope with on a flight. By playing that recording through my speaker system I can produce a consistent background noise to test the efficacy of the noise cancelling on different earphones. The MW07s offer some general reduction in the background noise, but it is still very noticeable. The WF-1000XM3s in contrast are incredible when you turn on ANC. The low frequency rumbling that is so annoying and tiring virtually disappears. There is still some noise in the higher frequencies but what a difference. This was with Comply Foam tips so I cannot say how they perform with the Sony supplied tips, but I suspect that they would still be extraordinary. On the sightly negative side, the sound quality on the Sonys isn't as good as the MW07s which are probably the best sounding totally wireless earbuds you can have.

The Best Thing Yet in Wireless ANC Listening!","I was a big fan of the WI-1000X’s (around the neck high end Sony earbuds.) They were extremely comfortable with great presence, separation and tone, and adequate ANC. The biggest drawback with them was battery life and most certainly, battery charging time which took dreadfully long. I had tried the industry leading Sony WH-1000XM3’s (cans), but even with the app I could never get the presence or tone out of them that the WI-1000X’s gave me. Beyond that they felt heavy, uncomfortable, almost always hot, and definitely claustrophobic. All of this contributed to their lack of presence. Granted the ANC was superior, and the battery life almost insane, but I just couldn’t make them work. So enter the WF-1000XM3’s. Out of the box the tone was just too high and bright, but fortunately, the accompanying app gave me the chance to do requisite tweaking, and after about a half hour I had them rivaling my WI-1000X’s, and after five days with them, I have to say I am extremely impressed! They are lightweight and comfortable, and have stellar presence and sound! I’m not sure the ANC is as good as the WI-1000X’s, but the real test will come on the first set of flights coming up. Beyond all of this, they boast excellent battery life, reserve power with the case, and quick charging. There is no wireless charging option, which would have been nice. The Bluetooth connects easily and has good range. And handily, when you pull a bud out of your ear, whatever you were playing pauses, and restarts as soon as you slip the bud back in. The touch controls are okay - a little finicky for my taste, but they’re not a problem. They lack a volume control, however, which was extremely nice with the WI-1000X’s. So, the drawbacks for me at this point are minor. With the WI-1000X’s you could pull the buds out of your ear and they just hung off of the neckband ready to be re-inserted. With the WF-1000XM3’s I’m at a loss about what to do with the buds when I pull them out of my ear. The case is too bulky for my pockets and just stuffing the buds into my pockets doesn’t seem like a good idea. But I guess that's the problem you get with truly wireless buds. Lastly, I ordered the silver option and I wish I had gone with black, a purely minor personal complaint. I would highly recommend these - they’re the best thing yet in wireless ANC listening! One other note, I bought these for slightly less than retail through an “open box” option with Amazon. They arrived quickly and were absolutely “like new” and I have no complaints about buying them with this option at all.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-09-17,Amazing Earbuds,"I am an audio engineer and an audiophile, and I have various headphones including Sony's wf-1000xm3 headphones (their newest large noise-cancelling over-ear ones) as well as the new Beats PowerBeats Pro, and I don't understand the negative reviews here. These things are great. ---PROS First of all, as the professional reviews have noted, the noise cancellation does absolutely work, and it works very well. These are not quite as ""isolating"" as the over-ear noise cancelling headphones because there is no over-ear cup to block the sound. (Obviously.) But for earbuds, and compared to PowerBeats Pro for example, they really do block much more ambient sound and what Sony has done with noise cancellation in this small form factor is really incredible. I tried it inside with loud a/c running, and walking around the streets of Manhattan, and they give me about 70-80% of the noise cancelling experience I have with the big over-ear ones, which is really amazing. Sound quality is great, with wide range and crisp definition, and personally I like the sound better than the PowerBeats Pro. If you want a boosted bass sound, you can get that with the EQ inside of the Sony Headphones Connect app -- the bass boost preset sounds really really good. (I have it on by default now.) A few other notes, especially compared to PowerBeats Pro. The battery case is much better in my opinion. The battery case for PowerBeats Pro is really big and bulky and is impossible to carry around comfortably in your pocket (looks like a hamburger). Not so with Sony -- the case is really high quality and slim and pocketable. I know these technically aren't waterproof but I tried them for a brief run in the gym mainly to test if they'd fall out, and they were just as snug in my ear as Apple's AirPods. (I needed to choose the smallest size for the earbud piece though.) The touch-sensitive buttons on the side are surprisingly responsive and useful. The right side works like a standard multi-function headphone button (touch once to play or stop, twice to skip to the next song, three times to go back a song). CONS For me these are minor. -They don't have volume controls on the earbuds themselves. Personally I don't care -- I can easily access the volume rocker on the side of my iPhone as well as the volume control on my Apple Watch, so I don't need it on the earbud itself. -Supposedly no waterproofing. I've worn other Sony headphones for sweaty gym workouts and never had a problem, so I'm guessing this will not be a big deal. -The Sony Connect app, while pretty powerful, is a little fiddly. But if you take a sec to figure out how it works, it's quite useful.

Despite the quoted battery life, they lose 50% of their charge in just over an hour. They almost always fail to charge in the case without a lot of wiggling and checking to make sure they're charging. The way they indicate that they're 100% charged is not distinguishable from the way they indicate they're not charging, so there's no way to tell if they're fully charged or not making contact with the charging pins. Because they only use one wear sensor (unlike AirPods, which have two, one on each side of each earbud) they frequently turn on in the case if they're not making perfect contact with the charging pins, so it's not out of the ordinary to put them in in the morning to find a dead or partially charged battery. The touch control to switch between ambient sound and noise cancelling often takes upwards of 10 consecutive touches to register once. And don't even get me started on their iOS app -- it barely works, frequently loses the ability to connect to one of its registered devices, and firmware updates are totally broken on iOS 13. They sent me a survey by email to learn my thoughts on the headphones, which I couldn't complete because it was so full of misspellings and English grammar errors that I couldn't understand half the questions being asked.

About this one, I loved the sound and noise cancelling features but with pain in my hart had to return them for several issues. I tried two different, when I found the problems with the first one asked for a replacement thinking that I got a lemon, but no, the new one had exactly the same issues, so if it is a lemon, we are talking about a box full of them NFC Function is great, and as already said, Great Sound quality, Great Noise cancellation, apparently this should be enough regarding headphones. But don't even think in use them to workout, they will be constantly dropping out to the floor. The charge is very unstable, at the end I found out that sometimes they don't connect to the charge even though they are inside the case. The touch functions are a joke, they work whenever they want, sometimes have to touch them carefully and repeatedly to get the desired function. Constantly dropping the Bluetooth connection, and when that happened the only solution to make them work again was to put them inside the box and get them out again, so I had to have the box(that is not too small) constantly with me to be able to use them. When connected to some devices initially they worked fine, but after a while the right one dropped connection, and the left one continues working. Just after I decided to return them I noticed that one had the led constantly on in blue, by the way, I don't think that having leds constantly blinking in your ears is a good idea. I'm very disappointed and really wanted them to work, but I'll wait for the next release to see if they improve the design. The funny thing is that when you search on internet in most of the sites that make comparisons they are the best ones.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,0,2019-09-27,Just no...,"I hate these headphones with a passion. I missed the return deadline and now I’m stuck with these. The Headphones app barely works. My headphones will be on and discoverable but the app will fail. I’d have to manually go to the iPhone Bluetooth settings to pair them each time. The device doesn’t appear in the quick audio output list in the control center. When finally connected, expect to have them disconnected soon. It randomly drops ALL the time. After speaking to someone on the phone and switching to another call. Or podcast to another podcast. Or if I’m listening to something, and a call comes in. You better bet the audio is no longer coming from where they should be, but from your iPhone’s internal earpiece. I’d have to pair them manually all over again. It takes forever to reconnect or switch between devices. You have to hold onto the touch pads for 7 seconds. (My old Beats X take 3 seconds). This wouldn’t be much of a problem if I didn’t have to do it so often. And when it is finally connected, sometimes one earbud will have no sound. Sometimes they’ll both have sound, but one is lagging a second behind. Other times, sound flickers, goes in and out due to connectivity issues. On the headphones app, it’s already set to prioritize audio connectivity rather than quality. The touch pads to control the headphones will be triggered by inanimate things, like my sleeve, pillow, or sometimes my own damn hair. The volume is cut in half when paired with a Mac despite being on the loudest setting. (Forums show other customers experiencing this with no resolution). Physically, they feel like they’re on the verge of falling out. My ears start to become sore and hurt after about an hour. I’m using the smallest buds. The noise cancellation is okay. It takes too long to switch environmental context, both by manually triggering the touch pad or by tracking your speed. Their press-to-pause is essentially useless because by the time the headphones has registered your command, you could’ve taken off your headphones by then and have had a full conversation. That’s not to say the sound isn’t great. It’s a little lacking in the bass end but I’m not an audiophile, so I can’t give an accurate assessment. But with all these downsides just from operation and execution, they’re 193884939% not worth it.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-09-29,Clearly very good hence the 5 star rating. ;,"Overall obviously a good product since I rated at 5 stars. I haven't read all the reviews so not sure if this information is out there or not, but something that I've figured out about VOLUME CONTROL (at least on android phones). If you set one of the ear buds to the google assistant, you merely need to hold your finger on that bud and speak the volume level you want, eg. volume 4.5. You don't need to say, ""hey google"" since it immediately starts listening once your finger is on the pad. In regard to the negative reviews about CALL QUALITY... I have no idea what they are talking about. My girlfriend and I tested this extensively, and she could hear me clearly. Funnily (if that's a word, at least spell correct thinks so), during our call, I put her Apple ear bud in one ear and one of these Sony buds in my other ear and I could hear myself on the call and I agree it sounded perfect. Maybe someone is having another issue or maybe there has since been an update? In regard to one of the buds LOSING CONNECTIVITY. I did have this happen twice, but in the setting of turning the buds off using the phone app, and then trying to reconnect to see if they turned on automatically, and one did while the other didn't. Though it eventually did when I turned them back off and on. This is an unusual situation as you don't typically need to turn them off. The second time it happened, I popped them in the case, took them out and they worked again. Since that time I have used tried various things to reproduce the scenario without success. For example, I had both in, took one out, left it there and left the room. Came back, put it back in and it reactivated. I put one back in the case, using just one, put it back in and it worked. I've traded taking one out, keeping the other in, so forth and I've had no problems since. So not sure on that one, except knowing it can happen but seems to be easily resolved. Regarding SOUND QUALITY. Very good. I am an audiophile and have extensive sound/music equipment including about 10 pairs of various wired and wireless headphones including standard over the ear, open back, and buds. These are as good as any high quality headphone. Something that some people might be ignoring is that although out of the box they only sound slightly better than the AirPods, with the app you can adjust the equalization (5 level EQ) along with a Clear Bass adjustment (either negative or positive bass adjustment for 10 levels total I think). Ater spending a few minutes adjusting those parameters while listening to music, they now sound about twice as good as the AirPods, well you know, as far as I can tell. For the most part I agree with other reviewers on the other aspects. Hope that helps.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2019-10-01,NOT FOR SPORTS!! Disappointing noise cancelling.,"Man I have been super excited about these for a couple months now and when I finally get them, wow, such a disappointment. They will not stay in your ear, and ABSOLUTELY will not maintain a good seal if you're, eating, talking, working out, or just moving around some. Yes, I read the directions, you have to twist them into place, which did help, but not enough. Also the ear pads showed wear after just a few uses, like they were getting cracks. Noise cancelling is noticeable but not impressive. I think part of this is because the seal is so inconsistent. I have several pair of ear buds, headphones, wired and wireless. I had the Sony WH-1000XM2 and XM3. Absolutely amazing, especially the XM3. I have the Bose wired ear buds that are excellent, and the Galaxy buds. I have to recommend the Galaxy Buds over these, before even considering the price. Galaxy buds sound almost as good, stay in place MUCH better, the case is more convenient(wireless charging and smaller case), and are much cheaper. the Sony WF-1000XM3 do have very good sound quality, though not at the level of their big brother from Sony. Also they will pick up your voice better than the galaxy buds and have longer battery life and NFC pairing, but none of this is any use if you can't keep them in your ear. I even tried them in bed, which works great till you turn your head. Since they stick out more than the galaxy buds they will easily hit the pillow and lose their seal or fall out. If you work out with these they WILL fall on the floor at some point so be careful. I wanted these to work so bad I keep using them for 3 weeks but I just can't make them work for me. Might buy an extra pair of Galaxy Buds to have one at work. Oh, I do have the B&O buds, which I've had for over a year, and I'd say they have just as good of sound quality as the Sony and possibly as good of noise cancelling, though just passive cancelling. Battery life is definitely weak on the B&O though it's usually not an issue for me.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

It also fit very well, especially with the foam tips. My biggest complaint with these is volume. Sometimes, I want to be awash in music, and these phones can't give me that. Not even in my apartment, which is pretty quiet. I ended up downloading an app that allowed me some volume control, though it still fell short of what I was looking for. Full disclosure, I had been using the Shure 846 wired IEMs, and while I did not expect to get that kind of sound, I had expected a bit more than what it delivered.

Battery life, I haven't really tested yet. But I already know that it lasts longer than my JBLs & HKs.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-10-23,Really Superb Earbuds,"Although I’m comfortable with tech, I’m not particularly an audio expert, so this review will be from a user’s general perspective. I’ve used headphones for years, from my old iPod to my current iPhone. The Sony Wireless Noise Canceling Stereo Headset, WF-1000XM3, replaces two good wired ear buds I’d been currently using – by Sennheiser and Bose, primarily for listening to music. The Sony, hands down, has superior playback quality. In fact, the quality is shockingly better, truly superb sound. Again, I can’t comment on the HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1e or the 24 bit signal processing, but they sound terrific! I do use the headphone for walking along roads often, and without the noise canceling function, I’m able to hear “ambient sound,” i.e. traffic about as well as with the two wired ear buds. I don’t use noise cancelling on the road. Haven’t had an opportunity to fly with them yet, but the noise cancelling feature does work well to tune out a neighbor’s barking dog. Getting set up required a bit of guesswork – the instructions were basic, at best. (I guess you have to limit text when they’re in 9 different languages). I’m also more verbal, and the most helpful instructions were pictorial. A few more impressions – the Sony buds fit nicely as you spin them into your ear. Several sized silicon rubber inserts achieve a comfy fit. I’ve gone 4+ hours with music playback, so I believe Sony’s claim that a charge will get you 6 hours. I *love* that the two earbuds are marked left & right. Also – very easy to put away: just match the brass colored connections and they magnetically join. Very easy to charge too. Only complaint is that the attractive, compact charger/case has no way to store the USB *short* charging cord, which I think might be easily lost. As a leftie, I also love that I can tap the left ear bud to change settings. Really, the Sony buds are quite easy to use once you learn about them. Very easy transition to taking a call while listening to music. One minor annoyance – and this could be on Apple. When I’ve handled the ear buds, say to put them in the charging case, they tend to turn on iTunes on my phone. I’ll walk by it and hear music playing out of the native speaker. Last word – I’m a senior. If you’re in my age range, don’t hesitate to get these great ear buds out of anxiety over tech. They are really a great product that I’ve grown to love and I feel confident you’ll enjoy them too.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2019-10-27,"Great headphones at first, but sound deteriorated way faster than expected.","I originally bought these headphones through Best Buy, but I’m writing a review here because this is where I read product reviews. The headphones are great. The tip selection really allowed me to figure out what produced the best fit and gave the best noise cancelation. The noise cancelation blew my mind for a pair of wireless earbuds. They aren’t much more money then some of the other wireless buds on the market and if you can live without the water proofing they are definitely worth the extra couple bucks. Also, most wireless earbuds have a crippling audio lag that makes watching videos impossible. These barely have any lag at all which makes it way less annoying than anything else out there. The negatives; The app is a little finicky sometimes. You could be connected to the buds, but the app doesn’t say you are so you have to take them out of your ears put them back in the case and then reconnect them. I also wish there was a way to see the individual charging status while they are I’m the case. Granted they charge really quick so it’s not that important. As far as I’m concerned there is no way to tell how much better life your case has left and I wish the app told you that. The biggest reason I’m giving the earbuds 3 stars is because I haven’t used them enough to warrant a blown driver. The right earbud has a noticeable buzz on bass notes. I use these maybe once or twice a week and I’ve only had them for about 3 months. I don’t think earbuds are this price should be losing quality like that so soon. Normally, I would wash my headphones out with 90% rubbing alcohol and get any dust or earwax out that might be causing the issue, but I’m not about to do that with earbuds that cost a small fortune. This just happened so I’ll probably contact Sony in the near future and edit my review based on what their customer service says. I still think they are worth the buy because they truly are the best noise canceling earbuds money can buy right now.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Otherwise everything else is Great.,"TLDR: This gets 4 stars because Active Noise Cancellation is.... average ... Otherwise everything else is Great. That said... these are $230 because of the ANC. Knowing that ANC is, not great, I would only really pay $150-175 if that feature didn't exist on these. I'm a connoisseur of the ~$300 headphones, since way back before we all were able to walk around with phones/MP3 players. I swap back and forth between Shure, Sennheiser, and Bose. This price range, I've found, is the sweet spot, where you the sweet high-end quality without stepping into ""professional"" level price ranges. None of the foam tips work for me. They comes with 4 silicon tips (extra small to large). Just like any other in-ears, you have to get the right fit. Luckily the largest ones fit for me. I can easily bend over, tip my head, walk, etc. without them coming loose. I'm going to buy a couple other variations of large tips to try to get a slightly better fit After tweaking the equalizer in the Sony app, I can honestly say these sounds great, for all types of music. Enough said. Well worth the money. Noise cancellation... this is the real let down. I'm used to the Bose QC35. Granted, those are $100 more expensive, I was expecting better. The ANC is there, you can tell when you turn ANC on, but it's soooo subtle. If you have a fan on in the background, it'll muffle it - where the QC35 will eliminate it. Battery life. I only need them to last 2-3 hours at any one time. They last at least that long, so good enough. They charge up quick. They are comfortable enough to wear until they run out of battery. I don't know about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week comfortable, but if you need that level of comfort, you should probably no be looking at in-ears. *update* getting a 3rd party pair of Large foam tips, these fit and sound even better.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

THEY WILL NOT STAY ON.,"I have never went out of my way to leave a review but I can not believe this. I have had so many issues using them that they are basically a very expensive paperweight. I have to say, in the beggining, altough the call quality was pretty bad (people kept telling me that i sounded like a robot), I was quite happy with the sound quality when playing music from my phone. But when I first got them, I was sick in bed for a couple weeks and they fell off a couple times I didn't think anything of it... so it took me a while to realize when I started getting up again and trying to go out or even do things around the house with them, that I have small ears and due to their design, they would ALWAYS fall off any time i slightly moved my head forward or to the sides, so I quickly stopped doing so after almost losing them a couple times (and I did try several foam and rubber tips to see if that fixed it. Nope. I also tried tugging my ear and pushing when I put them on, did not help either). Well, I thought, when I get my new laptop with Bluetooth I'm going to be able to use them, and since I did like the sound quality and I don't move that much when I work on my laptop, they were finally going to be useful. Wrong again. I finally got the laptop and I was angry to see that I couldn't even use them for that when any audio I tried to play came out cutting. And I highly doubt that my brand new and updated professional laptop is the problem. I saw online many people had the same issue. So now, I cannot really use these headphones mainly because of their faulty design, on top of several other problems, and I would like Sony to take responsibility for their defective design. Do not launch something on the market before it is thoroughly tested and if you plan to cater to only certain people with bigger ear canals, at least warn consumers about it. The headphones themselves work fine, and I would gladly send them back for a refund so I can spend my hard earned money in some headphones i can actually USE...

It charges via USB C, which I appreciate because its a better, easier plug than micro USB. It came with half a dozen different sized plugs, it was a bit confusing which was for which, but on the third set, I found a pair that feels snug without feeling uncomfortable. Honestly the fit is so gentle that I keep thinking they might fall out, but despite trying to make them fall out, they haven't yet. (probably more of a testament to previous earbuds that didn't stay in). I have fairly pronounced ear ridges for them to nestle into, so other people may have a different experience. When I first went to use the Sony app on my iphone, it failed to connect. Instead, I went to settings -> Bluetooth and added them there. What was nice, was it automatically popped up the ability for me to go to the app store and download the app (but I had already installed it), and a few minutes later, after going through the configuration, I had my noise cancelling setup and was listening to music. Wow! I went from Bose Sport earbuds (where are amazing) to these and the sound is distinctly an upgrade. Not only that, but my office is near a busy road and now my music isn't competing with the cars. I'm really really impressed. Excellent sound, excellent bass, the noise cancellation is great (probably 75% reduction, I'm sure I could get better with over the ear, but for the convenience of these, I'll take it!).

I bought them almost exclusively to block sounds while I am in a noisy place. I have very sensitive hearing and some sounds will literally, physical knock me over. It’s weird. What can I say? The noise cancelling feature is positively delicious. Put the earbuds in, turn on the noise cancelling function and suddenly, I don’t want to stab my ears out and can venture into public places knowing that if I need to, I can pop these in and have some control over the way sound hits me. I can still hear conversation albeit somewhat muted. I can still hear some ambient sounds but not in the clash of everything going on at once. It is as if the earbuds help to ‘sort out’ the various sounds around me and make them more manageable. It’s hard to explain. When I use the Ambient Sound setting, I find conversation more difficult. I hear more of the sounds around me but again, in a more orderly way. When all sound settings are off, all sounds are muted simply by way of the ear canal being blocked by the ear buds themselves. I do appreciate the different size and type of ear tips as I have very small ear canals. I find these comfortable if not a little heavy. They stay in if I seat them well but I do feel as though if I were to swing my head, they might fall out of my ears. It’s a good thing I don’t jog with them. I’m not sure they’d stay in. Still, many reviews say that this is not a problem so maybe it’s just my tiny ears. So, why the four star review? Well, for the hefty price tag and the brand, I truly expected better sound quality when it came to music. It also struggles with connectivity in that it will be connected to my phone but won’t respond to the tap commands to play/pause. Sort of frustrating. Even more frustrating is the quality of sound when on a call. Every single call I’ve ever taken using these headphones have been met with “hello? Can you hear me?”. Eventually, I just end up pulling them out of my ears and taking the call directly from my phone. Lame Sauce. Again - for the price paid, these really should be capable of managing a phone call. Other reviews show this as a common complaint so I guess I’m not the only one disappointed about sound quality and crappy phone calls. Basically, I paid a bunch of money for the noise cancelling feature. It’s a good thing that it does this really, really well or they’d have been returned.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-23,Excellent Sound and Noise Cancellation,"Headphones are mission critical for me. Due to gun violence I have acute PTSD. Headphones (along with some Bruckner and Bach) reduce my hyper-vigilance. The more isolated I can be from what is going on around me, the better off I am - be it Whole Foods or just the walk to Whole Foods. I read a few comments criticizing the ANC. Those folks do not know how to use the app. All the way to the left is noise cancellation. I find complete isolation (or back these would go). ANC is first rate. Yes, I know, there is an inherent danger to walking around effectively deaf to the world. I'll cope. One minor issue: Tapping the left earbud toggles the ANC: On, Ambient Sound and Off. The selection returns a voice confirmation that I find impossible to understand. Keep in mind that you can do this through the app. First thing you want to do is bring these to a full charge. The app will apply a firmware update but it is fussy about the amount of charge required to do so. There is a ""360 sound"" configuration which you should skip the first time around. You'll need a great deal of patience, and maybe a Xanax, to set it up which involves taking pictures of your ears — seriously. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be a supporting Android app. The charging case is magnetic so the earbuds seat correctly every time while allowing easy removal. The Android app is a bit buggy which is the worst thing I can say about these buds. While the buds stay connected the app keeps disconnecting for some strange reason. The app does not have to run to use the earbuds. If you close the app the earbuds retain whatever settings were in place. Sound is fantastic. I find it improves by turning off the Dolby processor. An equalizer is available through the app. Google Play Music starts automatically when the buds are removed from the case. You can connect to multiple devices but only one at a time. Again, the sound is very rich with good bass and clear high notes. I had good results with Wagner. Miles Davis and some 60s hard rock. I might be a senior but I am still a geek. I gave up reading manuals around Redhat 8. This is an exception. You really should read the manual. The included manual is impossible to deal with. Fortunately, on Sony's website, you will find a comprehensive ""Help Guide"" that is easy to read. Sony provides enough pairs of tips to fit every conceivable ear size (and then some). Best bet is always the largest set that you can use without being uncomfortable. Sony did cheap out on one thing: The damned C-Cable is about six inches in length. They also figure that everyone has enough adaptors at this point (they are correct) so none is provided. Bottom line. Premium performance is in line with the premium price. My last set of ANC ear buds were half this price. This is the first pair of truly wireless buds I have had. I must say that it is nice to get that thing off my neck. The downside is some loss of convenience.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2019-11-23,Frustrating to use,"These headphones have some really nice qualities that are ruined by some very frustrating behaviors. I took them on a two week transatlantic business trip where I had hoped to use them with my Samsung S9 phone, Samsung Tab3 tablet, and Dell Latitude work laptop. PROS 1. Sound quality is fine. It's not the best (in fact I have Sennheiser wired earbuds that are 1/4 the cost that sound much better) but they are still quite good for something so little and battery powered. So I consider this a win. 2. Noise Cancelling was perfect in a car, train, or bus. 3. Battery life is excellent. I was really impressed at how long these last and how quickly they charge. 4. The case is great. It's a little too bulky to carry in a pant pocket, but it is a really good design that keeps them from getting lost and keeps them charged. 5. Ear cushion options are great. It comes with a total of 7 pairs of ear cushions to choose from. This is practically a requirement for this design because without the right fit these will fall out quite easily. CONS 1. I did finally get it to connect to my Win10 laptop, but it was more complicated than my phone or tablet. First you have to update the firmware, and then hold both sides for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode. This took me forever to figure out because I did not need to enter paring mode to connect either my phone or tablet. I didn't even realize this was an thing. So for my whole trip I was frustrated that I could not connect these to my laptop. 2. Spotty bluetooth connection with all devices. One ear would sometimes just not connect, or suddenly disconnect. The fix in all cases was to disconnect and reconnect. 3. Microphone during phone calls was very susceptible to background noise. People had trouble hearing me, unless I was in a perfectly quite room. In a taxi or walking on the street, these were practically unusable for phone calls. 4. Touch controls for phone calls are not documented, possibly non-existent. When trying to change the NC option during a call (via the left touch control) it would just beep and do nothing, or even just hang up. I ended up getting disconnected from conference calls due to this. 5. Touch controls are not reliable. Sometimes it simply does not detect a touch, or it does and even beeps to signal it registered the touch, but then still does nothing. Most noticeable when trying to change NC options via touch. 6. NC in the airplane only worked slightly better than no NC at all. 7. NC in wind actually makes the wind louder. 8. NC in some rare cases seems to get out of sync and actually just creates more noise. 9. The volume is uncontrollable with the laptop. 10. Audio volume is not in sync, or not working at all, with tablet or phone. This was most troublesome with my tablet. If I first had it connected to my phone, and had turned the volume down, then connected to my tablet, the volume is stuck low and I can not turn it up (the tablet default bluetooth volume is full volume, so I can only turn it down). The fix is to disconnect the tablet, reconnect the phone, start media, turn the volume up all the way, disconnect phone, reconnect tablet, and viola. When they worked, I was very happy with them. But unfortunately, they are far too often frustrating to use.

While I didn't get them for listening to music, you totally can and they will sound like a good pair of wired headphones if BT source you're using supports high fidelity. Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. The touch buttons, while a good idea at first, perform very poorly. There's a significant lag between touching them and experiencing the effect of the touch. I found myself double and triple activating the buttons because I thought it didn't register the touch the first time around. Pretty bad. Then things get worse. Battery life is dismal. Li ion batteries don't like to be charged to 100% and kept that way. After desperately searching for an OFF switch on the headphones and then on the case, I resigned myself to just putting them down and waiting for them to power off. If only. They would randomly come back to life and more often than not, I find myself with low battery after less than 48h since last full charge and less than 30min of use time. Most of the time one side will be down to 20% while the other would be 70% or more charged. I also found the battery levels to drop from the reported ""about 50%"" to ""low battery"" within 15 minutes. Ridiculous. A bad attempt at copying the iFruit company. Like most other BT devices, they suffer from the occasional stutter and magic disconnects. To add insult to injury however, I also discovered that if you pair them to more than 1 device, the device that comes back to life last, will steal the connection upon powering on. Yup.. if you're connected to your phone and laptop and and the laptop turns on, the connection automagically switches. At least in my case it did. So overall not something you want to spend over $200 on. I didn't get them for the noise canceling feature and have consistently avoided doing so. I like the pass through sound mode, so you can hear the environment.

I wear these in the New York City Subway and bear witness to their glorious victory over Mariachis, Buskers, Showtimers, the Loudly Unhinged, and the Self-important Conversationalists. By pressing on the left earbud you can simultaneously pause playback and noise cancellation to listen to your environment and toggle it on or off. The right earbud controls playback and digital assistant integration. No volume control via touch, must be adjusted on device. The machines themselves are well designed. Their aesthetic is elegant and mostly subdued with a flash of color. The Black option is adorned with Copper accents and the Silver option (which is closer to what silver looks like at golden hour, if we're color balancing here) has Gold accents. Both decidedly high-end executions that feel solid and worth your expenditure. My set included 7 different size options: Large, Medium (which ship on the units), Small, and Super Small; Large, Medium, Small of a shallower depth and different, more cushioned material.

I must admit that I was disappointed when I first received them. I had trouble getting them to stay in my ear and the volume was insufficient. In addition, the sound quality did not impress, I liked the iPhone wired buds which came with the phone better, Then I started switching out the earbud tips which came with them. there was some improvement, but they still had inferior sound quality. I was thinking about returning them when I decided to try some memory phone tips I had on another set of buds. This made a huge difference! First off, I noticed that the volume issue was solved. Rather than dialing them up to maximum or almost maximum, I was able to use them at 50 or 60%. More importantly, the sound quality was greatly enhanced - with the bass really coming through. Maybe my ear canals are oddly shaped and the rubber or silicon tips that came with them would not sufficiently seal the buds to my ears. Others may notice the same thing. One other issue is that they worked great on my iPhone and my MacBook pro, but were unlistenable with my iMac. After some research, I finally determined the problem was my magic mouse. By turning it off, the sound was fine. Luckily I still have a trackpad to control the computer. Apparently its bluetooth does not disrupt the buds.

This has been an issue with four previous Bluetooth wireless earbuds. I have been wearing them daily to take my dog on his morning and afternoon walks. Sound quality is excellent. Initially, I noticed that as I was walking, if there was any wind It was picked up by the microphone. The wind noise is distracting and interferes with the sound. I started to play with the accompanying Sony Headphones app and found that turning off the ambient sound function helped to diminish the wind sound problem. I like that I can tap the left bud once to pause the music if I need to talk to someone. I charged the case when I received them and after using them daily for the month, I have only charged them one additional time. When I put them in my ears the buds tell you the percentage of battery life and that I am connected to Bluetooth, a nice feature. With the latest App update it now gives you a percentage of charge for the case. At age 68 and attending too many loud rock concerts in the 60’s and 70’ my hearing is declining with age, but these earbuds still deliver excellent sound reproduction. I would have given these earbuds 5 stars, however as my primary usage is outdoors, I continue to hear wind noise when walking despite changing the ambient noise setting. It is minimal but still noticeable so I gave them four stars. I also plan to wear the earbuds when It is warm enough to bike, and have concerns about wind noise with that activity. I am still experimenting with different size earpieces, between the foam and silicone to find the right size. I have an issue with the left earbud falling out when walking.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-12-12,Luxury In-Ears from Sony,"So Sony sent me a pair of these to try out, as I'm a convert to their wireless Over-the-Ear headphones from Bose noise-cancelling headphones. Those are my favorite pair of headphones ever, so I was super eager to give these a go. I've owned Apple Airpods and Beats Bluetooth Powerbeats, and these are noticeably better on a lot of fronts. Comfort: Surprisingly, they fit super well and stay in my ears. I usually have issues with that, but they're snug, comfortable and lighter than they look. I worked out with them nearly all gym exercises (running, rowing, lifting, etc.), but if you're going to do a lot of HIIT movements or jump roping, you might look into something that wraps over the ear. But for more gym uses they're awesome. Way louder (or at least seemingly so with noise cancelling than my Beats). Sound: At first I thought they were a little tinny on the high-end, but I forgot I had been compensating for my Beats lack of volume with a treble-heavy EQ in Spotify. Once I reset the EQ, they were spot on. Suprisingly more bass response as well. Noise-Cancelling: So the noise cancelling is actually noticeable and legit, something I was skeptical about in an in-ear, but they'll also never be as noise-cancelling as over-the-ear headphones. That comes with the territory. I actually like there's a tiny amount of bleed so I'm not totally oblivious to the environment around me. If you're looking for even more ambient, there's an ambient sound which works great, one of the things I love about Sony's over-the-ears. Controls: This is maybe my only complaint, but in reality, it just took some getting used to. The controls work really well, almost too well. Every time I would go to adjust the piece in my ear, I'd accidentally hit the large control space on each bud, which would pause the song or change the sound mode. I just had to adjust it by holding the edges, instead of accidentally placing my finger on the middle of the bud. Not a big deal, just took some adjustment. But if you're looking for easy control over playback and settings, definitely not a problem here. Conclusion: These are probably the most luxurious in-ears on the market, which justifies the price point. If you need ultimate isolation over everything, I'd check out Sony's over-the-ears. But if you're looking for amazing quality in-ears with noise cancelling and great sound, these are imho, the best.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Here are some things I noticed: 1. The headphones only charge from USB - USBC cable provided, Sony locks you in on purpose because their cable ONLY charges those headphones and none of my other devices would charge from the cable provided. The Sony headphones would only charge from the cable provided in the box. This means that I cannot share something basic like the cable between my JBL Charge 4 and these Sony headphones. I would understand if the charger needed to provide a certain voltage, but this is specific to the cable. 2. The Sony iOS app for managing these headphones is really buggy and needs a lot of work. 3. If I leave these headphones connected via bluetooth to the iOS device, it would cut out the music that I play on other devices if the IR sensor gets triggered (for example, if I pull them out or put them in my ears). This means that I have to go and disconnect the headphones from the Settings to make sure they don't send a signal for my device to stop/play music. 4. There is constant wireless interruption when I play music from any app (including native app) on iOS device. I made sure the firmware was updated to the latest. None of my other bluetooth headphones have this problem. The interruptions appear as noise for half a second or less. It appears to happen at every minute to 3min intervals. 5. It's a pain to pair more than one device to these headphones. 6. The sound quality is decent, but in noise cancelation mode, the sound of voices can still be heard.

Unboxing them there were a few things that I loved right out of the box. USB-C charging is a great feature. As most of my device are now on the standard, it's nice that I'm one device closer to finally removing the micro USB cable from my backpack. Also, there are six additional sets of ear tips with three different sizes in both silicone and foam. I generally have a difficult time finding earbuds that fit well, but with the many options and some trial and error I found these to be very comfortable. The overall look of everything was also very sleek and refined which is just a nice extra touch. Setting them up is easy and NFC makes it a breeze. The app definitely stands above the competition and has a ton of features such as EQ and adjusting the noise canceling intensity. The EQ wasn't anything I thought I needed, but I found myself using more and more. I really enjoyed using them daily. The sound quality is great for casual listening, but amazing when I was actively listening to music. The channel separation is fantastic and each frequency comes through nice and clear without overpowering each other. Initially, I discovered they weren't as loud and some I've had in the past, but the noise canceling really negates the need for outrageous volume. Watching movies with these on my tablet during flights was my favorite experience. The dialogue was clear, bass had great punch for action scenes, and the noise canceling made me forget I was on a place. The audio syncs up perfectly with the video which is also something I've had issues in the past with other wireless ear buds. Exercising with these was not my favorite. In all fairness they aren't really advertised to be used this way though. They don't have any kind of sweat resistance and once I got hot I had some trouble keeping them in. One unexpected area they shined, though, was using them while drumming. They stayed secure, which is something I've had problems with. Also, the noise canceling really muted the sound of my own drumming so I could hear the music I was playing along to. Their performance was on par if not better than over the ear style headphones. Overall, these have been great for me for daily use with great comfort, sound quality, and features.

They are just as good as new, but loads cheaper. Review: I had these for about 3 weeks hefore returning them, for several reasons. The buds worked just fine, no problems whatsoever, but I just felt like there was more that could have been done to really make them worth it. It was a worthy first release, but in the end, I would prefer to wait until the release of a WF-1000XM4 model to see if they've perfected the design. 1. Sound quality: This is all subjective but I feel like more bass was needed. It was too neutral for my taste. The mids and highs were definitely clear, but there was something that made the buds sound a little too synthetic for my taste. Probably just the way I tuned them in the equilizer. Also, these only support the SBC codec. While that isn't terrible (because they still sound good), at that price and at this day and age, you should be getting the aptdx codec as well for higher quality music listening. 2. Noise-cancelling: the reason everyone bought these things. Right now the competition is really in between the Airpods Pro and these. Most online reviews say these beat the Airpods, and I have no doubt that for their ears, it was so. But for me it wasn't. I tried both side by side and while the Sony's may cancel out more low-end noises and rumbles, I was disappointed by how little it cancelled out high-end sounds like voices. I then compared them side by side with the dishwasher going on in the background and found that the noise of the washer was cancelled more on the Airpods Pro. So, for me personally, I think the ANC in the Airpods was slightly better. But in any case, ANC for the Sony's was slightly underwhelming. Like I said before, I would wait for the 1000XM4 to see the improvement in ANC tech. 3. No IP rating for water/sweat proofing. 'Nuff said...like c'mon Sony. 4. Does not allow full freedom to modify the touch controls to your liking. Basically you have 4 options: Pause and playback/skip tracks; volume control; voice assistant; and toggling between ambient sound and ANC. The buds really only allow you to choose 2 out of those 4 settings, while the other 2 would require you to take out your phone. I was grateful they finally put in volume control, but I didn't want to have to give up one of my other controls to use it. I eventually settled on toggling Ambient/ANC on the left and voice assistant on the right, through which I could control volume and pause/play. It worked for a bit, but was a little too finnicky. I would prefer to just have everything on the touch controls. 5. They look super good, but just a tad to big for my taste. All in all, if you're on the fence about buying these, I'd say save your money and wait. There is a lot of unmet potential in these earbuds that I feel could be realized given a couple years. They're a good prototype, but by no means are they perfect.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,0,2020-01-14,Waiting for the next incarnation,"I really wanted to like these. They ooze quality in how they are built, their appearance, the slick charging unit, and exceptional sound-stage. I used them over a 5 week period under various conditions and concluded the following: Sound quality, excellent. App, excellent. Noise reduction: very impressive. Sitting still on an aeroplane, great. But despite numerous attempts, using all kinds of tips, twisting and squeezing, the fit just didn't cut it. The seal was excellent as the noise reduction was nothing short of remarkable. But I had no confidence in them staying in my ears over time and especially while moving about. I finally gave up on the day I returned them, giving them one last chance while walking to work for 15 minutes. During that time I must have re-twisted and positioned them some 8 to 10 times. But the biggest niggle for me was that during these 5 weeks I attempted to source extra tips for them, to ensure a more stable fit. I googled and read up on others’ attempts, and began to order some third party foam tips to try. I contacted all the dealers in my area to find Sony’s own replacement tips, but these are not to be found. One googled tip (!) was to buy a cheap pair of Sony earbuds for $12 and use the assortment of tips with these as future replacements, as Sony uses the same tips on all its buds. So, worried that if I were to keep the buds for a while, and that finding future replacements might be difficult, I went ahead and bought a pair. But hey presto, the tips had the same inner diameter but were shorter, so this solution didn’t work. Then I just stopped in my tracks and thought: wait a minute. I shouldn't have to be doing this. Sony is producing an expensive piece of electronics without marketing spares. One could cynically imagine them sending out one of many messages here (add your own): 1) Our silicon tips will last for ever so you dont need replacements, which is why we don't market replacement sets of tips; 2) we are leaving it to third party manufacturers to find better solutions; 3) when the tips are worn out then so are the buds so buy a new pair…. and so on and so on. What’s the thinking here? Finally I returned them to my vendor. As I walked out of the shop I spotted a returns bin with 18 sets of these earbuds that had been returned and were reduced. Seems I am not alone. Hopefully Sony are listening, and solve this issue, perhaps by including a rubber hook or extension (together with microphone issues that many have complained about). I eagerly await the next incarnation. Methinks these were rolled out just a tad too early. Shame. What amazing sounding earbuds.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-01-15,Apple vs Sony,"Both the Apple Airpods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds had very good reviews so I decided to purchase both and see which one worked for me. Sound: I have been in audio engineering for 40 years but honestly sound is a very personal thing. Some people like heavy bass while I prefer a genuine full spectrum experience, as if I were sitting in front of a live orchestra. That said, I suspect the Sony earbuds will make the bass aficionado very happy. In my opinion they lacked a full range experience while the Apple was very refreshing making every instrument stand out, even the softest notes. Both had good quality as far as NO distortion even at max volume. Speaking of volume, the Sony could not achieve the same loudness as the Apple. (I should also point out that I was using an Apple iPad Pro as my source device, not that it ""would or should"" make a difference) The Apple also had better clarity most likely because the Sony bass drowns everything else out making it sound a bit muddy. Comfort: In my opinion the Apple wins this one hands down. The Sony is much heavier and seems to run a bit hot as my ears literally burn when I use them. I can't imagine trying to listen long term with the Sony while the Apple earbuds feel very comfortable for the long haul. They both have different size buds that can be interchanged very easily. The Sony has more options and even has two different materials that might appeal to someone who has skin allergy. The down side of the Apple might be that because they are so light it might be easier to loose them however if one the Apple buds fall out, the sound comes to a halt on both which is very nice. Another thing to point out for the athletic type is that the Apple is sweat resistant where the Sony is not. Function and Control: I hate to keep harping on the Sony but once again it mostly fails in this category. One thing the Sony has that I truly like is the ability to pass through external sounds by simply touching and holding the left bud. This also pauses what you are listening to while you attend to the interruption. Once you release your finger it resumes your music or whatever you are listening to. Unfortunately the Sony tap (touch) control for pausing, advancing and changing sound modes are hit or miss at best. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't making for a very frustrating experience. The Apple has a little microswitch on each bud that consistently works as advertised. Either left or right bud of the Apple perform the same function while the left and right buds of the Sony have unique functions. The Apple has a seal test that you can run in the app settings to help you get a good fit. UPDATE: After loading the latest firmware the controls are much better for the Sony. No other improvements noted. Carrying Case: On both of these the case function as an integral part of the system. They both have internal batteries that charge the buds while the buds are in the case. The Apple case is a bit smaller and lighter making it the better choice for my pocket. The Apple can also be charged wirelessly or by USB cable where the Sony must use a cable only. The Sony is more stylish and feels more expensive. I haven't yet tested battery run time but from what I've read, they are both similar. Summary: Overall the Apple is my pick and makes me very happy. I'm sure there are many more options one might consider concerning either of these brands but this is just my experience in a nutshell and I hope it is helpful.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

They perform great while listening to music during air travel due to the noise cancelling, clean sound and decent battery life (I generally only have a 6 hour commute from door to door and the app was reporting 30% charge left on buds). The buds charge very quickly in the case, so longer commutes shouldn't be an issue. Con: There was significant interference in lower Manhattan while walking around the streets in certain areas (audio choppy and cuts in/out). While annoying, the issue was isolated and fortunately only in areas I was passing through briefly. Another issue is with hands-free call quality being pretty much unusable in areas with moderate to significant ambient noise (crowds, music, etc..). The caller reports hearing the ambient sound far overpowering my voice which sounded muffled and distant. There has been a recent patch to address this issue, but I haven't yet confirmed any improvement first hand. Personal note: Careful with these little guys.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-14,The best ... If you set them up correctly,"UNBOXING: The first thing to do is to find the correct fit. This, like it has always been for in-ear buds, is a trial and error process. Out of the box, Sony provides you with six pair of tips - 3 pairs of silicone ones and 3 pairs of memory foam ones. I have large ears with almighty ear canals, and based on my past experience with other in-ear buds, I went for the large memory foam tips. These turned out to be too big, and the earphones dangled precariously off my ears. So I swapped them with the medium foam tips; this gave me the perfect and the most comfortable tip. The next thing I did was pop the earphones back into the case, and the case to a power supply so that both the case and the buds charged to 100%. I already had the companion Sony Headphones app on my phone, but if you don't, you can download it. Once they were charged, I launched the Sony Headphones app, went through the connection wizard, tapped my phone on the case (NFC) and that's it. They were paired - a very hassle free, and a no tech challenge process, which anyone can do. Bluetooth connectivity was perfect. I could roam around anywhere in my 1 room kitchen apartment without losing connectivity. Once these babies were paired, I popped them into my ear, and then launched the companion app to configure them. CONFIGURATION & PLAYBACK: Right out of the box, this pair provides a very neutral sound-stage with clear mids, though the highs can be very tinny and the lows quite muffled. This might make some people to take the knee jerk reaction of returning them as they do not sound all that well for the price. Well, don't, and have patience. Configure them to suit yourself, and that's how you'll get the best out of them. Configuration depends on the kind of music you listen to, and hence this step is critical. Personally, I'm not beholden to a particular genre, which makes this stage of the onboarding a bit difficult. I launched the Youtube music app, and started cycling through some of my favorite songs in the metal, pop, vocal, reggaeton, hip-hop, EDM and trap genres. To give an idea: I cycled through songs by Pink Floyd, Paradise Lost, John Legend, Post Malone, Nicky Jam, Alan Walker, Lil Nas X, Skrillex, Flosstradamus, Fever Ray, Florence + The Machine & Eminem. And post that, I went to work with the Equalizer, tweaking it while cycling through the same songs to find the perfect blend of settings that can achieve the sweet spot of a great sound-stage applicable to all these genres. My final equalizer settings for the slider bars: +4, +2, -2, -2, 0 with Clear Bass set to +8. I found that these settings gave me the best sound-stage across all the genres (of course, these won't be perfect for any one genre, but it is either that, or tweak them according to the genre that you listen to). I also set DSEE HX to ON, since this allows for the audio stream to be upscaled to simulate a high resolution stream - a good to have feature if you listen to streamed audio like I do. With the afore mentioned settings, I found that I retained the clear mids, but I was also able to deepen the lows and make the highs sound natural. USAGE: The drivers do taking some burn-in, and I started hearing a slight upgrade in quality after the first 10-12 hours of use. This was the same for my WH-1000XM3s, which sound absolutely wonderful after 4 months of use. While this pair is great on the ears while traveling (I sweat quite a bit, and the over-ear cans become uncomfortable for me), I'd still prefer the WH-1000XM3 if I'm at my desk working, or if I'm in an airplane traveling, because there is definitely some ear fatigue (which is typical for in-ears). The fit, once you have achieved it correctly as described in the first part of this review, is secure, and I did not feel any risk of these falling off. I would definitely not take this pair out for jogging or any gym exercises, since they are not water resistant, and the fit is not secure enough to handle strenuous activities of jumping, running, etc. CONCLUSION: All in all, this is a great pair, and well worth the price, if you have the patience to configure them according to your specific use cases. I highly recommend both the models from Sony, both are winners in my book, and I hope to use them for many years. PS: If you use the Tidal app, it's probably a good idea to go through the 360 degree music setup. I don't, and hence I didn't.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2020-03-10,Magnificent with a few frustrations,"These Sony wireless ear buds are my favorite tech item. I absolutely love so much about them from the sound quality to the compactness to the battery life. But they are flawed enough that I do not think they deserve five stars. 9 out of 10 if it was possible. How can this be? Read on. (Programming note: I tested these headphones with a useful Spotify playlist called ""Songs to Test Headphones With"" -- I also listened to my regular music for months and months with these headphones because I enjoy them so much and because it was so hard for me to write this review) Sound quality: Everything begins with the sound quality. The Sony WH1000XM3 over ear headphones have this magical, immersive sound that makes you rediscover music and luxuriate in sound like nothing I've experienced before, despite having listened to some very good mid-range headphones before. The problem with the WH1000XM3 headphones is the size. They are large over the ear headphones. That is what makes the WF-1000xM3 earbuds so incredible. Sony engineers have somehow managed to get 85% of the sound quality of the WH1000xM3 headphones into small ear buds. If sound quality is important to you and you need earbuds you can stuff in a pocket, these earbuds are absolutely exceptional. If you travel everywhere with a bag and this is not an issue, consider the WH1000xM3 over ear phones. There is absolutely no comparison to lesser earbuds like the Samsung Gear Icon X--the Icon X sound like scratchy AM radio after listening to music on the Sony earbuds. Bluetooth phone calls: The quality of bluetooth calls leaves a lot to be desired. In a quiet place, sure its fine. But in any kind of noisy place it is almost impossible to have a call. The aforementioned Gear Icon X do a better job. Sony seems to struggle with bluetooth generally. Bluetooth connection: The earbuds independently connect to bluetooth, which is great, but I suspect they have some issues in terms of bandwidth/transmission, because they seem to work flawlessly in my home but out and about they frequently drop. Perhaps a more technically minded person has more insights. Battery life: Absolutely stunning. Not only have I never run out of charge on the battery case despite being tremendously lazy about charging it, but I've never run out of charge on the buds. This would doubtless change if I wore them on an international flight, but for ordinary daily use, you'll be hard pressed to have battery issues. Fit and comfort: I don't love the fit of these buds. They are a little bigger than the typical earbud and always feel a little awkward when you are walking around. It's important to find a positive fit for both noise cancelling and sound quality, so this may take you a little work. They also are not great earbuds to work out in as they don't tolerate sweat well. That said: they are without a doubt the most comfortable earbuds for long duration listening I've ever used. I even fall asleep wearing these earbuds and wake up hours later with no discomfort. Really exceptional. Noise cancelling: Actually really fantastic BUT Sony has insisted on making the default settings less than full noise cancelling, maybe because they are worried about people walking around and getting run down by cars they don't hear. To take life into your own hands, you have to go into the Sony app and set everything to max. Once you do, the outside world is very effectively blocked out. Yes, you can still hear murmurs, but it knocks everything down twenty decibels. This is amazing for plane rides and other persistently noisy environments. The only problem is that people cannot see the earbuds in your ears and sometimes will end up yelling at you, frustrated that you cannot hear them. About that app: It's a little finicky but absolutely essential to gain control over your earbuds. If I wasn't able to turn off the touch controls on the side of the earbuds, they would be a 2 star product for me. But because I am able to go into the app and control this, the earbuds are much more useful. Ditto some other quirks: if you pull one ear bud out while on a call, the other ear bud persists. If you pull one ear bud out while listening to music it pauses. You can change this in the app as well. I am not sure which way I prefer, but its nice to have the option. You can also let the app analyze your ear shape for a supposedly better quality sound. I haven't gotten around to doing this. If you drop one of your earbuds, Sony has your back by providing a blinking light. This light is only active if the earbud doesn't sense any pressure around it (ie its not in your fingers or your ear). This is pretty clever. Missed opportunities: I do not know why manufacturers insist on putting controls on ear buds. I never use them in a positive fashion and I just end up mistakenly doing things while adjusting my earbuds. Instead, why not make the battery case a remote control? I would also love to see a special edition of the case decked out like a Sony Walkman. Wouldn't that be cool? Overall, I think these earbuds are fantastic. You get truly exceptional sound quality--a balanced and immersive experience that sounds great for everything from classical music to hip hop and rock in between, truly hearing all the details of your music--in a package that fits into a jeans pocket. That's pretty amazing. Add to that very good noise cancelling and excellent battery life. True, the bluetooth calling leaves a lot to be desired and occasional bluetooth drops may frustrate you, but pound for pound, these earbuds are the champs.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2020-03-19,Mixed feelings -- but DECENT in conclusion,"I have been using the product for about 2 months so far. I am a semi-audiophile that has owned/used various earphones & speakers, etc. PROS 1) Sound -- it has been long since I was truly excited from the sound quality of the earphones. Bose SoundSport Free came close, but that lacked proper seal & came with poor connection issues, etc. Of course Bose QC35 I and II also were decent in sounds, but we want to do apples-to-apples here. Simply the Sony WF-1000XM3 has great sound quality if you can make a few adjustments in EQ & your music player settings. Low bass is underemphasized so people who like thumps and booms will not find these enough. But for people who love to hear the clarity of female vocals & higher-pitched instruments will find these earphones great to listen to. 2) ANC -- decent. -10db in the bass (vs. -20db Airpods Pro); everything else is comparable to the Airpods Pro. Bose QC20 still rules in ANC but then again that is wired ANC earphones and also may give ear pain and/or headaches to some. So Android commuters will find these Sonys a decent option. But the Apple side should just go with Airpods Pro (unless Sound quality trumps your decision, then Sony has a marginal advantage). CONS 1) Comfort -- pretty bad. It is extremely hard to find the right fit & seal. None of the given tips and foams fit my ear canal. I had to get SpinFit 360 S/M sizes. Even then, the fit wasn't perfect - though significantly better than what Sony provided. Airpods Pro trumps in this regard. But it is not all that bad if you are just a regular commuter looking for decent ANC earphones with great sounds. Also of note is that is cheaper than Airpods Pro by about $50. 2) Connection -- is decent, but I have intermittent drops especially in areas with 2.4GHz signals (think of WiFi, radiowaves, etc.). But is not too bad, again, as they connect back pretty quickly. Also, the mobile app has an option to make the connection a priority over the sound quality -- not sure how better this option is though.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Right out of the box the “Used Like New” device was broken. Amazon Warehouse shipped this product and it was an honest waste of my time to receive it. Super disappointed as I was looking forward to these, I have since returned them and just gotten a new pair from Sony directly. Serves me right for trusting the warehouse.

CONS: -ANC makes my stomach turn. I have tried a number of ANC headphones and earbuds and I have never had this problem until I tried this pair. -Due to the size of these earbuds, they're not very stable and can fall out easily -Another drawback of the size is that they have various contact points with my ear, causing discomfort over time -Touch controls aren't great. Although they were very responsive, they just don't offer enough options. Because of this, I had to omit volume controls in favor of ANC/ambient sound on the left ear and playback controls on the right ear. -The lack of volume controls presented a huge problem because the when connecting to my pc, the earbuds would automatically set their current volume as the max volume. This meant that if I was connect to my phone, listening at 50% volume and then switched over to use them with my pc, that 50% volume automatically became 100% volume on my pc. The only way to adjust volume any louder would be to turn on volume controls on the earbuds and manually turn up the volume. -Connection was poor and consistently broke up. Not great, look somewhere else.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-04-19,A LOT better than expected,"I've had these for a month or so. I really like them. The first pair shipped would emit a high-pitched noise out the right ear. Like really ringing.. like a broken hearing aid... Exchanged them after suspecting the noise-cancelling mic on the right bud was bunk. Exchange was quick and easy. These sound really good. I have a bunch of earbuds and A LOT of headphones. These stand up to most of them. Definitely ones in the same price range. The highs can be a bit harsh if pushed and it takes some adjustment to get the bass right but these have become my new favorites. The noise cancelling is better than my best noise cancelling headphones (Beats Studio 3). I have not tried them on an airplane yet but in all environments I've tested, these are better noise-cancelling. I'm guessing it's because they literally plug your ear, rather than cup over it. Battery life is good so far. The case is a charger for the buds which is really cool. The app is a bit clunky and sometimes there's bluetooth connectivity issues. It would be great if these were easier to pair, especially with non-phone media players. Also whenever I get a phone call, my ringer is deafening... This is mainly the reason for the 4-star rating. As a standalone noise-cancelling earbud, these are great. Hopefully software can be fixed.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

If you want these so that they'll cancel out all the noise in your environment for you -- that is, you couldn't hear the doorbell if it rang or a dog if it barks, they're excellent for that. Excellent - I can't hear a thing. I don't really know why I'd want that though. The person on the other end of the line knows what's going on in my house more than I do.

Sony,WF-1000XM3,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-05-01,Very Impressive,"SO, read lots of reviews, good and bad. I recently got the Sennheiser Momentum 2's and the Galaxy + buds. Sennheiser is descent all around but needs improvements. Galaxy + were a huge disappointment for me, bad fit, lacking sound etc etc.... A few weeks ago I got the over the ear Sony WH1000XM3's and was so impressed with those, I had to try these. Got them today, fit is very good (I have larger sized ears) and the sound is awesome! I was very very surprised and impressed with the sound which is very deep and full like the over the ears one (just not as good but close). I get that seal that is needed, they remain in my ears with no issues and after 1 hr, I had no problems with comfort. I got the silver ones and love them. I did get these at 1/2 the price on an open box/unused purchase elsewhere but they are worth the full price if you get them on Amazon. I did not test the phone calls yet and have not put the battery to full test so that will come in time. If I get 6 hours out of them, I will be very satisfied. I also noted the noise cancelling to be excellent for in-ear buds. They will never be as good as over the ears but they are quite good and will get tested when I cut the lawn tomorrow. When I cut the lawn last week I wore the Galaxy Buds and all I heard was the lawnmower so that will be a good test. I am really glad I got these, especially at the price I paid and I got the 2 year square trade for peace of mind. I would highly recommend these...just don't understand the bad reviews I read on lacking sound, lacking noise cancelling, fit.....they are all great for me and my ears. I have 3 of the wired SHURE ear buds and these sound better than any of those, even the $800 pair that I wish I never got.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07TD96LY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
