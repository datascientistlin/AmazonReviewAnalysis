Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-02-14,CANCER,It causes cancer. why buy ?
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,"So far, so good...","These are a decent set of true wireless earbuds. I have only had them for one day, so I may need to adjust this review later, but I have tried them in several ways and tried most of the options. They are comfortable and come with three sets of tips and wings. The wings help to keep the buds in your ear by hooking to the inner fold in your ear once twisted into place -- you can't feel them, but if you try to take out the earbuds, they have to be twisted to come out -- thus they feel secure in your ear. I also like that they can be used in either ear a single earbud -- you can have one charging in the case and use the other and then switch. It is also nice that when you take both out, it automatically pauses audio (or video). It does not automatically resume audio/video, but you can do that with a single tap. The ambient noise mode seems to work pretty well but I have noticed a whistling noise when moving quickly such as walking fast or running. I can definitely notice a difference with ambient noise with it on and with increasing/decreasing the sensitivity via the Wear app.
The case is nice and small, but I think that is why it only stores one full charge in it, but I have not tested the battery life yet. The sound is good with these earbuds. The equalizer could use more options. Call quality is decent, maybe a little tinny. Also, the person on the other side of my phone call reported distortion in wind, I am a little disappointed as I thought the extra microphones would be better at filtering out noise that was not my voice from the call. The touch controls are pretty sensitive and the only one you can customize is the long tap and there are limited options of volume (left lowers and right increases volume), voice command, or ambient sound (which turns it off or on, does not change the sensitivity)."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,My new favorite earbuds,They sound amazing and the ambient sound is drastically improved!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Great!,"After years of trying to find wireless buds that fit well and sound great I basically gave up until I received these. They fit so snug and the bass kicks quite nicely. The ambient sound is a little weird at first but works very well, I no longer need to pause the music to have a quick conversation. Phone call clarity is great on both ends as well."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,0,2020-02-15,Decent upgrade to galaxy buds,"Downloaded firmware update after updating wearable app. It improved the sound quality. Comply foam tips for galaxy buds fit these. Sound quality overall is improved, it's not a giant improvement but it is noticable. Overall these are good earbuds. Comfortable, easily pocketable in case,long battery life. In my opinion, better than airpods."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Small and light,"Moving from Bose Soundsport Free and these are absolutely great. Much smaller and lighter, stereo calling compared to mono on Soundsport and better overall sound."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Great update,"Mic quality is so much better. Sound quality improved too, but I can confidently make calls now."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-15,One thing is for certain,Epstein didn't kill himself
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,BIG IMPROVEMENTS!!!!!,"I'M LOVING IT!!!! NO REGRETS!!! For starters, 2 way speakers.... I'm loving it!! More ""tugs!"" You can really tell the difference. Okay, it has gotten more responsive touchwise and no delays at all. Games, music, or movies.. no problem. The magnets and hinge in the case has gotten tighter. You will now have no problem loosing your buds by falling off from the case when opened. This is not a complete review. So far I don't have anything bad to say. I haven't checked the mics, but watched a review on yt and it was crystal clear even outside. So, I will give these buds 5 stars!! I recommend!!! I'm loving it so much! It's not like ""meh"" feeling when you put them in.. it's like ""wooooah"". Another feauture they added is the volume control. Double tap the edge of the right bud and the volume turns up. Left bud, volume turns down. Make suke to go to labs settings and turn it on."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-15,great headphones,the battery life is great on them and they work amazing.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Galaxy Buds+ are amazing,"So I was excited to upgrade from my Galaxy Buds to the new Galaxy Buds+ today. The extra battery kife, 11 hours, meant I could wear the buds longer each day. And the improved sound is anazing. But there is a feature that has not been touted yet and I think it makes these Buds+ number 1. It's the ambient noise feature. It includes options to increase ambient noise volume and I love it. I have a hearing loss issue and could use hearing aids. But these buds+ actually allow me to hear much better without expensive hearing aids. I thought the lack of ANC would be a show stopper, but with the proper fit ear tips, sound isolation is very acceptable and the extra battery life without ANC allows me to wear them much longer each day. I am very pleased so far. Highly Recommended. Best yet from any manufacturer. I am using them with a Note 10+ 5G and a Galaxy Watch Active 2. Wonderful experience I have wanted for years. Thanks Samsung"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Best Bang for your Buck,Airpods have left the chat......
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,Your $150 will not go wasted!,Excellent product and great upgrade over last year's buds!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-16,Great sounds from these and easy pairing,"I loved the quality of the sound from these buds. I doubt you will find better and they likely rival many wired earphones. They fit well, feel comfortable and all of the features work great. My only problem and one that may make me return them is the latency when watching tv. I expect it is hard to find worse latency. Using the same setup, these thing are clearly awful and make using them for tv impossible unless you pay no attention to the lip sync. Using a cheap pair of older Taotronics BT earbuds, my same setup is spot on but with these, its just no go. I will give Samsung a little time to fix this and will try a couple of other options from my BT stuff drawer before returning them but they just cost way too much if unusable for my primary need. After a couple of days, something seems much better with the latency. Its not gone but is minimal. My rating may improve a lot if this keeps up and that dreaded return might not be in the cards. The still sound just great!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-16,DON'T GET THESE! Problems after ONE week! See updated review!,"My new daily drivers ahead of my Liberty Soundcore 2s. At first I was going to return these because they sound really low paired to my Galaxy S9 and they seemed not to pair to my iPhone 8. After watching Flossy’s video, I left them a bad review and then I watched Noah Herman’s video on how to pair them to my iPhone. Now I’m stoked. They work fine and sound much louder connected to that iPhone. I’m happy with my purchase and I highly recommend them. I never had the originals so I cannot compare them. I like the liberties but these are the truth. A+ AirPod killers. Update :
After only one week of pretty light use, they stopped connecting to each other and will only work one or the other... Not together.. I'm kinda teed off because for 150 bucks + tax I really expected more. I'm sending them (actually taking them) back and I'm going back to my Soundcore's. These are off of my list. I really tried but at this point it's a hard NO! SAMSUNG needs to get it together. ✊🏿"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Upgrade now!,Better all around quality. Especially ambient sound. Audio quality is phenomenal. No need to talk about batter haven't had them that long.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Best of great ever,Excellent improvements Call to device connectivity to better settings for the ambient sound in a huge change on battery life excellent work Samsung
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Best wireless buds out there IMO,"I've tried the Sony WF1000XM3, Sennheiser momentums, Jay birds vista's, air pods pros, and the power beats pros and the Galaxy buds + are by far my favorite! Outstanding upgrade from last year's models! easy pairing, ambient sound is amazing, Value is perfect, battery life ridiculously impressive, and comfort is grade A."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,dope,dope but the black is a fingerprint magnet
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Worth every penny. Must buy!,"Wow. Incredibly comfortable, amazing sound quality, easy to use, long battery life, and so much more to brag about. Definitely worth buying."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,impressive sound quality,Top notch sound quality. I believe that new dual drivers are actually BA drivers. AKG did a good job tuning the driver.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-16,so sad to let it go(iOS exclusively),"-These are less expensive compare to similar products. -These look so great on anyone's ears. -Its sound quality isn't bad at all. -These fit so well that they just don't pop out randomly. -different colors are available to choose from. -You can customize the fit. -These sound/look very good. -Block noise relatively well even with PNC. Maybe equivalent to airpods pro's ANC. -Extremely long Battery life is not much of a concern for me, but it's a plus. Now, the problems:
-When galaxy buds+ was pared with iOS devices. Its Bluetooth connection and audio(music/voice) starts breaking up when you have reached its maximum signal range. The problem persists even when you came back within its sufficient range. (Solution: disconnect/reconnect)
- Even the default ear pieces fit very well on my ears, wearing them for about an hour caused my ear to hurt. So, I swapped them with smaller ear pieces, then the buds don't seal my ears that much that quality of sound and all decreases. I think those rubber ear pieces should've been much more softer/mushier so that it doesn't stress on your ears that much. -There's a slight latency when it pared with iOS devices. -Even if galaxy buds+ was advertised as iOS compatible, I guess still iOS users shouldn't expect these will provide a full feature like they do with android. The galaxy buds+ application for iOS currently is not compatible with certain iOS devices. However, they might fix that matter later. Error: ""app is not compatible with this device"""
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-16,3 stars because I purchased for the buds+ but does not fit,I ordered this for my new samsung buds plus. It does not fit. It fits the original buds perfect. But the new buds plus is slightly smaller. The lid doesnt close all the way on the plus version. But they are great for the original. And I also wished the hole for the carabiner was bigger. Check the pics of both buds with the case on
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Worthy upgrade over the regular buds,"So far I am really happy that I upgraded to the buds+. Ive had the buds for a year now, but like many didnt care for the call quality and the ambient sounds was soso. So with this, the call quality is MILES better and the ambient noise is really REALLY nice this time around. It sounds way better and louder than before. To me, the sound quality is about the same as before. The battery life is nice, but 6hrs was plenty for me. Id say if you dont care about phone quality, I would say stay with the originals. If you do make calls, but yes upgrade - its worth it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,"Amazing battery life , Sounds great to","1st time galaxy bud user saw these just came out . Girlfriend has the air pods pro didnt like the feel of half in the ear style . These are freaking awsome sound quality is great l, noise isolation is pretty cool and works well . App is great and easy to use and also has a iOS app. Fits perfectly in ear lots of sizes for ear and winglets. Love them the price point is perfect battery life is incredible love them"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,"Great Overall, Improvement Over Buds v1","Sound great! Definitely an improvement over the first version. Pairing was simple on all devices (Note10+, two laptops and iPhone 7). The upgraded ambient sound is phenomenal and crazy how well it enhances sound especially if you use the Samsung Labs enhanced option."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Worth the extra $20? Yes!,"I had the old Samsung Galaxy Buds. These new ones are a certain UPGRADE. Granted the sound quality is almost the exact same (slightly more crisp, slightly better bass, slightly better overall) but if you're looking to have much better ambient sound AND call quality, these are the perfect upgrade. Especially with a slight increase of $20. The only real complaint I have is the feel the new case has. It's more plastic-y and the hinge feels rather cheap. A nitpicky observation."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,Exactly what I wanted and expected from Samsung,"I've switched earbuds quite a few time over the last few years, but I don't think I'm going to switching off from these any time soon. The sound sounds absolutely stellar (I use the dynamic setting on the galaxy buds app), with the lows being punchy, and the mids and highs being crystal clear (and do not sound tinny at all). Overall, here is a list of pros and cons:
Pros:
- Great sound quality across entire range
- Clear conversations (the extra mic really helped compared to the previous galaxy buds)
- Very good amount of controls via taps, about the same as having a microphone headset with 3 buttons
- Ambient sound pass through
- Very good passive noise cancellation, with a decent volume of music block out almost all external sound
- Lab feature in galaxy wear app (allows for interesting modes such as extra loud ambient sound, I hope they will add more later on)
In between:
- No way of adjusting the volume with just a single tap, you need to press and hold (and set it that way in the galaxy wear app)
- Bixby (depends on if you like Bixby or not)
- 11 hours of battery life, and another 11 hours in the case (a lot of time, but the case only stores one full charge)
Cons:
- The buds themselves are comfortable for long time wear, but not at first. You will likely need to get used to them. Overall though, if you are in the market to spend $150 on a new pair of wireless earbuds, you will absolutely not be disappointed."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Recommended!,"I had the original buds and the only weakness it had was its poor call quality. It had a good sound and were very comfortable to wear for very long periods of time. The new buds + fixes the 1 complaint I had with the original buds while improving the ambient sound feature drastically. Ambient sound was just OK before but now it sounds great and natural depending on the level you set it to. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I prefer the sound of the original buds over the buds +. The bass response was better with the old buds in my opinion but I'd still recommend these over the originals. Re active notice canceling, it's not a feature I would use much in my day to day life but when I used to travel a lot I'd use ANC on flights with a wireless headphones and it really helped reduce the plane noise and helped protect my hearing while on those long flights, so while it's a feature not many would necessarily use, it's still a good feature that would have been good to include."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Better than the 1st Gen AirPods!,"Compared to my +3 year old, original AirPods, these are impressively far better in the general sound but more importantly, they fit much more securely in my ears and I like the expanded control I have, including the ambient sound control with the touch and hold feature. I had to get the rubber accessories to make the AirPods fit better and stay in my ear during any mild activities. Now I don’t need to with these Buds+. So far, so good. I hope they are durable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,From the old Galaxy buds these are a huge improvement,First impression.. five stars.. ambient mode is insane. I've had the old Galaxy buds for about 8 months now daily use and these out of the box are blowing it away with both sound quality and ambient sound. My wife always complains about phone quality from my old buds. We will test that and I will get back to you with that opinion later. Amazing and worth the upgrade already.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Good stuff,"Really enjoyed the original galaxy buds, these are newer, shiny, and even better quality than the original, fairly priced as well. Would recommend to a friend"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Awesome Buds! These are the shiznit!,"I absolutely love these ear buds!!! They are fantastic. If you read a review from anyone saying they suck, I humbly submit they are incapable of reading directions and setting the buds up correctly. You need a seal on the ear by using the correct wing fin piece or no fin at all (like my ears required) and the correct ear piece. I cannot get over the ear candy I am enjoying. The bass is solid, and the battery life is impressive. Definitely better than the previous buds. I highly recommend them. Currently listening to Depeche Mode and the music coming out agrees with this statement!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,Awesome ear buds,These ear buds are comfy and the sound quality is amazing
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Definitely an upgrade...,I had previous version these are definitely an upgrade i dont know but i think these are even less bulkier and great battery life.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Amazing!,Switching to these front my Gen 1 airpods and I am glad I did it. They sound amazing! And hold a charge. I've been using them since this morning and I still have juice in them. The ambient sound works very well. Definitely recommended.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Very Happy,Awesome sound
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-17,The new Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are the new winner! (Especially for phone calls),"***Long story short (This section is the whole review in a nutshell): These new Galaxy Buds+ are a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the original 2019 Galaxy Buds that released. I personally felt that the 2019 Galaxy Buds were a total failure for phone calls...and Samsung isn't lying when they say that they have improved call quality on these 2020 Galaxy Buds+! While many other reviews may have said that the “slight” improvements to the new Galaxy Buds+ are worth it, I have to say that the call quality is a GIGANTIC improvement on these new 2020 Galaxy Buds+. The original form-factor from the 2019 Galaxy Buds has remained for the new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ (and that’s a good thing), the Buds+ case easily fits into your pocket without taking up too much space, the Buds+ go into your ears perfect each time, they fit snug and stay in for many hours without hurting, they weigh nothing, they charge fast and the bigger battery lasts forever, they sound EXCELLENT with plenty of highs and lows which is an improvement over the original 2019 Buds, and most importantly, they are FANTASTIC for phone calls! The new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ microphones DO NOT pick-up tons of background noise while you are on a call like the original 2019 Galaxy Buds did (and this part leaves me ecstatic). I want to point out that the new Galaxy Buds+ are not perfect, and they do pick-up background noise, but it is a completely acceptable level of background noise…and the new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ pick-up nowhere near as much background noise as the original 2019 Galaxy Buds did, and not as much background noise as the many other wireless buds that I’ve tried including Apple Airpods 2nd Gen. ***Why am I so happy? :
The microphones on the original Galaxy Buds were garbage and would pick up and amplify ANY background noise around you, and drown out your voice while you were talking on a call, and all your callers would hear from you at the other end was the background noise around you. For example, if you were talking to a friend in another room in your house while you were on a call using the original 2019 Galaxy Buds, I promise that the person at the other end of your call would hear the other person replying to you from another room more than they would hear YOU (the person actually wearing the earbuds). Walking, a slight breeze of wind outside, light traffic while walking up and down the sidewalk, opening your mail or carrying a trash bag outside would all cause cringe-worthy pain for the person at the other end of your call, because the crappy microphones would pick-up EVERYTHING around you on the old 2019 Galaxy Buds. I returned 3 sets of the old Galaxy Buds just to see if I was getting defective ones, and I tested them with 3 different Android phones…and 5 of my best friends also complained about their own paired of 2019 original Galaxy Buds. These new Galaxy Buds+ do NOT have these issues like the original 2019 Galaxy Buds had. Rest assured…while the new Galaxy Buds+ DO still pick-up background noise more than your normal cell phone would, I believe that these new 2020 Galaxy Buds+ are FAR better for phone calls than anything I tried aside from the Dr.Dre Beats wireless buds (but I didn’t like the Dr.Dre form-factor for my normal day to day use in business). ***How did I come to this conclusion and testing? :
Okay so I've purchased a lot of wireless buds over the last year in a desperate attempt to find a product that lived up to its claims of working (properly) for calls/music/truly wireless/etc. Ironically, the original Galaxy Buds from 2019 were my first pair and they were garbage for phone calls because everyone I spoke to while using my Buds had told me that my voice was muffled, and ALL background noise was amplified by the microphone and ruined my calls. We are talking like moving paperwork around carefully on your desk while talking was annoyingly loud, or ANY other background noises like walking on a hardwood floor with dress shoes. It was so bad that I was ordered by my boss to no longer use the original Galaxy Buds for conference calls. The nice thing about the original Galaxy Buds was that I thought they sounded fantastic for music and they paired very well. I had about 5 friends with the same experience as me with the original galaxy Buds. Next I tried the JLab JBuds wireless buds, and they were like a knock-off of the Galaxy Buds. Overall fitment was poor in my ears, the case was too thick, the audio quality was bad and absolute garbage if I didnt carefully fit them into my ears perfectly each time (even with trying different fitment pads), and the microphones once again picked-up too much background noise (just as much as the Galaxy Buds did). Fast forward to a few more earbuds I tried....the Sony WF-1000XM3’s sounded awesome for audio, and looked and felt nice, but same deal with amplifying too much background noise while I was talking, and people said I sounded like I was under water…Supposedly Sony just released a firmware update/patch for them a couple weeks ago at the time of my writing and it’s “fixed” the issue, but even then, the Sony’s cost $199 right now while these Galaxy Buds+ are $150, so I would skip the risk with the Sony’s. Then I tried the 2nd Gen Apple Airpods, and same deal, excellent music and sound, surprisingly bad battery life, and background noise from my microphones ruined the calls when I would cross the street and there was traffic, or dogs barking in the FAR distance, or even just moving paperwork around on my desk or walking on hardwood floors got annoying. I then borrowed a pair of Airpods Pro from a friend and I tested a few calls with friends and just lightly tapping my pen on the table or again, moving paperwork around on my desk (carefully) still got annoying sound complaints and I was told that these noises drowned out my voice. My friend kind of laughed at my test results with his Airpods Pro and admitted that his wife frequently complained to him about his Airpods Pro picking up too much background noise as well, including when he would open his mail at home, despite the call quality being good-enough most of the time. The Beats by Dr.Dre Powerbeats Pro wireless earbuds were probably the best overall for phone quality out of ALL the other wireless buds I tried, however they still picked-up a decent amount of background noise as well in a normal business environment (think people talking in nearby cubes, copier machines or printers, keyboard typing, etc). [And I only say that the Dr.Dre Powerbeats Pro were the best overall *at the time*, before these Galaxy Buds+ came out] The sound was excellent, the battery was good, and fitment was good. I didn’t keep them though because the carry case was too big and looked stupid in my dress pants pockets, and the earpieces themselves were very large too and eventually got uncomfortable after I wore them for a while. Next I tried the Amazon Alexa Buds and they were far worse for audio/music quality compared to the Galaxy Buds, however the microphones and noise cancellation were better. I could have phone calls with people finally without being told my earbuds were garbage...however even with the Alexa Buds, callers COULD still hear amplified background noise in my surroundings while I was talking. Also, the Alexa Buds case was too big for my taste as were the buds themselves compared to the original Galaxy Buds (and I REALLY wanted the Galaxy Buds to work out because their form-factor was amazing, except for the lousy microphones). So I chose to hold onto the Alexa Buds for phone calls until something better came along. ***FINAL CONCLUSION: Now, finally, the Galaxy Buds+ came out and Samsung specifically said that they added another external mic to help cut down/subtract directional sound from the mic that was focusing on your voice speaking, and voila, the Galaxy Buds+ are now the best in my opinion. No, they're still not AMAZING and they still pick-up on some background noise, but it is NOTHING compared to the original Galaxy Buds from 2019, and is far better than the Alexa Buds and even the AirPods 2nd Gen. Plus I love the form-factor of the case, easy pairing, great battery life, fast and wireless recharge, EXCELLENT sound quality, and great looks and fitment. I can't be happier with the Galaxy Buds+ until they come out with a new model that hopefully further improves the microphone quality and cuts out on amplifying background noise while you are talking so that the mics finally work as well as a cell phone does with cutting out background-noise. For now, the Galaxy Buds+ are the best for calls in my opinion, and still top-notch for music while not the best thats out there (and I promise you the music and loudness is top-notch, I grew up with a dad who is a recording artist). Mind you, the Airpods Pro probably offer a little better sound, but the Airpods Pro also suffered from picking up on too much background noise...so again I go back to saying that these Galaxy Buds+ are the best for now. I look forward to seeing how good the new Google Pixel Buds 2 turn out...they may offer even better call quality and microphone noise filtering...but for now I'm finally happy that I have what I consider to be a very good all-around pair of wireless earbuds that leave me smiling."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Better than airpods pro,Great sound quality along with great quality while in a call! The ambient noise is so great aswell.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Better than I thought,"It's only been 3 days since I've had them but I absolutely love them so far! They're so easy to carry around and use everywhere. The ambient mode is super useful and great that you can turn it on and off easily buy holding the touchpad for 3 seconds. They sound awesome, great bass, and suuuuuper comfortable. They're so light you can barely tell they're in your ears and I've been wearing them for 4 hours straight as of writing this and they aren't uncomfortable even a little. No-brainer for $150. Get them, you'll love them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Very impressed,"My initial impression is that I'm blown away! The original galaxy buds were wonderful but the buds+ are a massive improvement. Here is a list of improvements I felt are notable
-Sound quality is incredible. Crystal clear seperation of sounds with balanced bass. The wearable app has preset settings to fit your taste as well. -The case is smaller and more pocketable than the previous model. -Battery life is significantly increased and not at the cost of style or comfort. -Ambient mode is scary accurate. Watched an entire episode of the office with them in and didn't notice a difference is sound quality(no music running just buds in). -Ambient mode now works with just a single ear bud. This scored major brownie points as this was something I had be longing for with my previous galaxy buds. -Ambient mode works during phone calls. Not sure if the previous galaxy buds did as I used a single bud for calls but this is a feature I like. -Call quality is significantly better. This was my one major gripe with the previous galaxy buds. The call quality was atrocious. Not with the Buds+! I come in loud and clear and the outside world doesn't. Overall this purchase has been well worth the investment and is an impressive update to the galaxy buds line. Worthy of the hype. I will update this review if issues of longevity occur."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-17,The Best Truly Wireless Earbuds!!!,"I've only had these for a day, but have been using them pretty extensively since I got them. Here are my pros and cons....
PRO
Amazing sound and ability to customize through the Galaxy Wearable app.
Compatible on Apple devices. Pairs within seconds out of the box and can pair on multiple devices. Touch controls are very easy to use and work seamlessly. Bluetooth connectivity is very stable and never cuts in and out like cheaper wireless earbuds. Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and fits super snug. Ambient sound option is great for people who work in office settings or if your walking outside. Can easily be turned on/off via touch control. CONS
Cannot use one earbud independently. Cannot control volume through the buds. Must use your phone or tablet."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-17,"The good, The bad and the “We’ll see”...","So the good:
On my iPhone 11 Pro Max with the iOS Buds+ app they connected sound great as other reviews have stated. The bad:
After a few hours on the first day the right bud stopped working. It didn’t appear in the app and was totally unresponsive. After a few fun sessions of reset, disconnectand reconnect it recognized both buds. Worked fine until the next day when, after a few hours, same thing happened again but wouldn’t reconnect after lengthy troubleshooting. Returning for replacement. The “We’ll see”:
I’m hoping the replacement works flawlessly and this was just a bad luck situation with a defective unit. I will update this review and rating when I get a chance to test the replacement."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Fantastic purchase,These earbuds are awesome!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Must Buy!,"Never leave reviews on anything. Simply put, a must buy! Best sound quality and awesome features. Especially the ambient sound!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-17,Almost perfect (for me)!,"Cons: - These don't have ""great"" bass (compared to the Soundcore Liberty Pro 2). - No custom EQ settings
- No AptX codec support (only AAC & SBC)
Pros: Everything else! I don't consider the lack of ANC as a con because I don't need it & wouldn't use it if it was included. The ambient sound works great, you should not have to remove these for almost any reason. These buds are small & can fit a lot of ear types. The tackiness of the tips help keep them in your ears. The (stereo) call quality (on the other end) is good as well. You will be heard & understood. I'm testing the battery life currently, but if it's anywhere close to 11 hours of playtime per charge, that's enough for most of us to get through the day. 4 stars because the sound isn't awesome for music, but it's good."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-17,Nice Buds -- However...,"The buds are honestly pretty good. Great sound and quality, but I've got one issue. I am hearing a very low buzzing sound coming from my right ear bud, being most noticeable when there is nothing playing on my buds. You have to really listen to hear it though so it's not the biggest annoyance, but I imagine it'll be more so as time goes on."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-17,IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER....,"These buds are great got them from Samsung 24hrs ago and what I can say is call quality is freaking awesome 10 times better than the first buds. I have a Galaxy note plus and the connection is great put I also connect them to my iPod simultaneously and when my phone rings my iPod stops and when I hang up the iPod starts back up again, the best thing ever."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Much better,"I must say, the plus buds are considerably better that their predecessor. I don't really think they are that much louder, but they sound so much better. The ambience setting on these things are amazing. Today was my first full day and I kept both in all day at work and had no problems. The battery is a huge happy factor. When I got home, some 11-12 hours later, I had recharged the buds and I had 44 percent on the case. Worthy upgrade."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,"Galaxy Buds, just with added oomph.",Added battery life plus a 3rd mic for call clarity and improved ambient mode makes this a no brainer.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Finally with iOS compatibility!,"I go back and forth from iOS to Android often. I had the first set of AirPods and they just never fit correctly. When Samsung releases the first version of the Galaxy Buds I adopted their growing pains and witnessed many software updates and poor call quality throughout. When the AirPods Pro came out, I purchased them as I was back on an iPhone. I still had some trouble with the fitment of these as they’d always push themselves out, an issue I never had with the Galaxy Buds. The new Galaxy Buds+ now offer iOS app compatibility and you get all the sweet options the buds had on Android (EQ, software updates, programming of the touch panel etc). The new buds offer an additional mic and unreal battery life! The battery life is much greater than most currently. The ambient mode is greatly improved and one of the best I’ve tried with in ear buds. Sound is still tight and crisp although I would like some deeper, punchier bass. The edge tap for volume control in the labs section is awesome and lets you use the touch pad for other options. Wether you’re on iOS or Android, these are greatly improved and in my mind the best buds in their price range. They definitely rival the Pros even though they have ANC and the Buds+ do not. Excellent buds! My biggest gripe is the new cases are glossy and they’ll be sure to get scratched and marred."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Worth your money,Super love it ❤ !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,One of the best Bluetooth buds,There is a extreme improvement over the original buds. So worth the upgrade just in sound quality and battery life.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-18,Almost But Not Quite,Had the original Galaxy Buds and the Icon X (neither were very good IMO) prior to that so was hoping for improved sound and better comfort but not there for me unfortunately. Everyone is different and have different requirements but I find these really uncomfortable to wear for longer than 20 mins and the sound is not great. I've tried all included tips and wings but not any better. I'm a big guy with a large head and ears so need the largest tips. I don't feel that they sit far enough into my ear canal and as a result the sound is quite tinny with no bass. I keep moving them around and pushing them further into my ear. When I do that I can hear more bass and better sound but it proves that the fit isn't right for me. The battery life is much improved and connectivity is excellent with no drop outs from either bud. Really disappointing as wanted these to accompany my new Galaxy Z Flip. Going to return and look at the latest Sony equivalent.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,So far so good,"Pretty good so far
Nice battery
Nice sound
No complaints from me"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,Amazing Ambient Sound! Perfect for work space,"First time buyer of truly wireless Buds. Paired with a Samsung Galaxy S9+ and galaxy watch active 2.
I'm most impressed with the ambient sound! Usually when I'm using headphones at work, I have to keep one earbud out in order to hear people approach me. With these, I keep ambient sound on the middle option, and can quickly mute or introduce noise with a press and hold of the TouchPad. I wouldn't recommend these for heavy gym use though, since they are sweat resistant."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,Galaxy S9 Plus,"These are my first pair of galaxy buds ever after trying a million different Bluetooth buds from Amazon. I have to say, these are it. The touch response is on point, battery is beautiful and the ambient sound option is an extra I never even knew I needed. You can hear everything around you while listening to music as if you had nothing on. They're small enough and barely noticeable when they're on too. The connection is perfect and they don't have the stuttering issue I've always had with other Bluetooth wireless buds. Recommended!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-18,Almost perfect.,"The only reason I take a star from these is the IPX rating should be at least 5 but other than that damn near perfect. Good sound stage. App works well. Very stable and comfortable to wear, and the battery life. I have tried and own many true wireless earbuds. Own Powerbeats pro. AirPod pro. I have owned Bose soundsport. Tried vista wireless. Jabra 75t. These are the best of them and at the price point unless you plan on sweating a bunch on them I’d get them. You won’t be disappointed."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-02-18,Ringing sound in ambient mode,"I think I got a defective pair. When ambient mode is on I hear constant ringing sound when paired to my iPhone, waiting for replacement."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-18,No BASS...Returned in less than 48 hours,These SUCK. there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO bass
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-18,Do not sound good,I tough it going to to be a good deal.I have to returned it because the sound it is mediocre my 40 dollar Ikanszi sound way better.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-02-18,so far very disappointed,"The reason i bought these when they first were released was due to two important factors for me. 1. the ability to use the left or the right earbud independantly. 2 was the ability to have two devices connected at the same time. My computer and my phone connected without needing to disconnect from the other when using. There have been reviews where people have said this is possible. Well after getting these buds, setting the up and trying them out..I have to say THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL. sure you can pair them with two devices but you they will disconnect from one while using the other. I can not listen to music on my computer and have the ability to receive a phone call and talk through the buds without disconnecting from the computer. FAIL..my Jabra Elite 65T can do that. the other issue with these which is the reason i'm returning them is when i put on Ambient sound I get a horrible ringing and buzzing in each ear. when I tun it off, they sound great. Again, my Jabra Elite 65t have a great ambient sound feature that just works. If Jabra would update these to be able to use the left or the right alone..they would be perfect. I'm hoping I got a bad pair of buds, i'm going to try one more pair."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,One of the best in 100-200$ price range,A big improvement
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Quality Product with a Great Battery Life!!,"These new Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus work great. For those teetering potential buyers out there...

- also comes with interchangeable ""winglet"" type fittings to adjust to your individual ear comfort
- battery lasted about 8h 20m listening to music a moderate level
- the charging case is glossy smooth and has a nice weight to it giving it a premium feel

- Easy to learn gesture controls: one tap, two taps, three taps, etc...
- Galaxy Wearable app is user-friendly
CONS:
- You need to download the Galaxy Wear app to get the most benefits

- The $149.99 price tag
Hope this helps..."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-19,Great ear buds if you don't have the original ones. If you do skip the upgrade,"I bought these as I saw reviews online saying how great they were. That the second driver they come with helped improve the bass which the original buds were missing. Also the call quality is supposed to be a lot better. I don't really use my buds for that but I though if the sound is that much better and the call quality was improved than the latter was a bonus. However the sound was not better. In fact I couldn't tell the difference between the plus and the original buds. After listening to multiple tracks they pretty much sounded the same. That was very disappointing. As for the ambient noise improvements I couldn't tell the difference either. The four modes they added (one is hidden behind developer settings) didn't seem to be any better than the old ones. If you are playing your music loud on either buds you won't be able to hear the ambient noise. It's really meant for when you have music or video at lower volume. It works really well with podcast or shows without a lot of action (explosions). However if you are jamming at the gym even the highest setting won't make a difference. I do like the look of them. The touch pad is shinier than the original ones and just gives it a cool look. I wasn't a fan of the case which is no longer matte black, but shinny black. It makes it a finger print magnet. As for the call quality I never got around to testing it because I was disappointed in the sound quality difference that keeping the buds and spending this much wasn't worth it to me for enhanced call quality. Again that is due to me not using any buds or earphones for talking on the phone. I do have to say if you don't own any buds and need some these are great buds. However if you own the original ones pass on the upgrade. Also for iphone users these now have an app on the iphone so they are a great alternative to the airbuds. They don't have NC like the airbuds pro but they are a lot cheaper. If you are a bass head I'd say skip them. They don't have a tone of bass. But other genre of music sounds great on them. I do wish for none Samsung phones they would support a codec above AAC."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Best headphones!!,Best in ear headphones I've used. Ambient feature is amazing sound quality is rich. They look and feel amazing
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,HUGE Improvement Over Galaxy Buds,"Like the previous almost identical version, these have the little backwards ring in addition to the ear insert in two other sizes - I use the largest. Both versions are the first wireless buds I have owned where they didn't try to fall out especially when eating. This made me forgive the lower quality of sound than the Pixel Wireless Buds I had previously. The additional sound components in the GalaxyBuds+ really brings it home. From reading professional reviews, I was steeled to not expect too much difference - it's the opposite - to me the difference in sound quality - voice, music, podcasts is over 100% improvement from the original GalaxyBuds..
In fact, aside from the Bose Wireless Sports Buds, the GalaxyBuds+ is probably the closest you can come to an over the ear product. Not sure why they didn't provide active noise cancelling - would be a welcome addition. Also, on the original Galaxy Buds, I have received complaints about call quality. I have not had an opportunity to wring the new ones out yet on phone calls - I hope to see improvements there."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-19,AirPods Pro owners review,"Here is the simple truth. AirPods Pro are the best wireless earbuds WITH the ANC feature. Galaxy Buds+ are the best wireless earbuds WITHOUT the ANC feature. The positives:
- Great sound...sound better then AirPods
- Great bass...more than AirPods
- Great battery life...11 hour rating is legit
- Good call quality...huge improvement
- Come in 3 colors
- Companion app works great for Android and iOS
The negatives:
- No ANC (active noise cancellation)
- Average Bluetooth range
Bottomline...the GB+ sound great and can be used all day long. The only thing they are lacking is ANC. Once you’ve used earbuds with the ANC feature in airplane or during daily usage...earbuds without that feature don’t have the same user experience. If you’ve never used ANC you won’t notice and these are the best option. I’d recommend these to family and friends especially if they want to save $100 over the AirPods Pro."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Awesome,Awesome
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Incredible battery life.,"Incredible earbuds. The ambient nose mode almost works like a hearing aid when turned all the way up, and the battery life is incredible. I've had one of them in my ear for a solid nine hours, constantly playing audio and it's only down to 44%. In fact, the battery life is so good, that I can put one in before work, and leave the case in my vehicle, since that one earbud will easily last the entire 10 hour shift (without ambient on, with it on it'll last about 8 hours)."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Worth the money,"I love this buds, they work great with my note 9"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-19,Not worth it.,Waste of money an my time will never buy another.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Awesome ear buds and great sound...,My first Samsung Galaxy Buds and they are awesome! I really like how easy they are to use and they sound great. Using the Galaxy Wearable app on my phone is great also showing the battery life and other features. Great job Samsung! Keep up the good work...
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Worth the upgrade,You got any airpods switch to the buds plus definitely way better
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,The most comfortable buds I have ever owned,"These buds are extremely comfortable to wear for long time! I always had problems with tight fit that irritate my ears and these buds fixed this problem...
Sound is awesome, could use alittle more base, but clarity is just great. No sync issues and no delays with video play back...
They look stylish in the ears and the battery pack looks neat. These are definitely a 5 star compared to others and. Well done Samsung!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Worth the upgrade from galaxy buds!,"I had the galaxy buds and I just got these yesterday and they are definelty a nice upgrade, they fix the mic issues with an extra mic outside and the sound is better. Also, battery life is insane!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,"You won't regret buying these, airpods have nothing on galaxy buds. Best earbuds EVER.","Huge improvement from last model. I use them every single day and I can tell you that these are the best ear buds I have ever owned. Upgraded sound, upgraded mics, upgrade battery life, everything about these is awesome! You will NOT regret buying these. Also the ambient sound on these Is an incredible amount better and the sound is so crisp."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,"Great improvement from earlier buds, Sound great, Love it","I got this pair of bud+ yesterday and already love them. It has great battery life, great sound, and fits comfortably in the ears. I used for workout today and had no issues with it"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,Wow....,"I have owned the Galaxy buds for about a year now and really liked them, except for the call quality (pretty much unusable). I didn't see anything out that had the smooth connectivity (Note 10) and features as the buds and call quality, so I decided to tough it out until something came along that I liked. The Buds+ definitely take it to the next level. The sound quality is great, battery life is significantly improved, ambient sound is effective (but tinny), more controls at the buds themselves, and of course, great call quality. They literally took all the things I liked and improved them and fixed all the things I didn't like. 3 very MINOR complaints. They don't fit quite as well as the original buds, but still great. I hit pause or play on accident when removing them from my ears. The ambient noise is tinny. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,👍👍 !! .. ..,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ !! .. ..
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,They are great,I love these
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,Great improvement,"Great earbuds, definitely an improvement from last years"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,Double the battery life!,"I purchased the original Galaxy Buds quite some time ago and didn't like the mediocre battery life. I'm very glad the Plus version nearly doubles the battery life, allowing me to comfortably wear them throughout most of my day! I highly recommend the Galaxy Buds for people with Samsung smart phones."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,Great for the gym and everyday things (Sophomore in College (Major in Computers)),"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I got these buds the 18th and have used them at the gym for 2 days and right out for the box they fit perfectly, no pain in my ears from them. The ambient sound works really well no as if not having them in your eat at all. the Lab part on the app is nice, double-tap the side to go volume up on the right and down on the left bud. Had no time delay between video and audio. they have decent bass, and I love bass. compared to the last-gen they are a lot better and worth an upgrade. I highly recommend these to anyone who is active and likes to listen to music on the go. (side note I am using a Galaxy 10 +). I have gone through many different pairs of wireless earbuds and these are by far my favorite to use."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,Great sound. Even better battery life. Best midrange true wireless buds on the market.,Had the previous Galaxy Buds for 1 year. Thought about replacing them with the Buds+. That thought turned into actually doing it after sending them through the washing machine last week. All I can say is wow! Huge upgrade. The ambient mode alone is soooo much better which is huge in my work environment. Tons of little improvements basically make these an entire overhaul and definitely worth the upgrade.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,It's a gamble but the chances of getting them broken are high,"Do not buy them yet, I bought them just to be really disappointed the left ear bud won't work it keeps disconnecting, it tried everything to fix it and nothing helped. I went onto YouTube's comment section to see if anyone else had the same problem because they all did with the originals and I wake up to three replies they all have the same issue with the plus"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-20,Same quality so far: Not same at the end....,"I already had the buds and now own the buds+
I've made different test with music and recording the microphone and so far they both have the same sound quality. I even played the same song on different devices at the same time using the new ones and the old ones at the same time on on alternate ears.... I must say its the same thing... so if you already have the old ones and dont care about battery life, its seems like it's the same thing to keep the old ones... I might return the new ones, I just want to test both of them on phone calls, that will be the factor that will make me choose if I should keep or return the new ones....
4 stars because it seems like they are the same as the old ones, will give 5 if they pass the phone call test later on this week.... will keep you posted
... So I tested them out for a couple days now,
These have better connectivity, now I can watch movies on my laptop using the headphones and the sound works perfect, battery lasts much longer and now I can finally do phonecalls with them and people can actually hear me. These are great, better than the last ones 10/10 would recommend. Happy shopping!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-20,Are they good? We'll see...,"Let me get it out the way, I like these. Now that's out our way, let's dig in.... My experience with the earbuds has been mixed. I have a non 5G Galaxy Note 10+ directly from Sammy and continue to observe Bluetooth stack freezing. So earbuds, they randomly disconnect only one, mostly the right side to the tune of 3 disconnects per day. Reboot on Note didn't help/factory reset or firmware update, nada. I did re-pair the buds to no avail. Hopefully there will be a firmware update in the future That can fix these expensive devices. On the interim, I love the sound, the low latency, the battery is awesome, they also charge fast, fits snug and don't cause irritation while sweating."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,AMAZING,Loved the Samsung buds! The Samung Buds+ blows my mind away. It's better in every way!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,Galaxy Earbuds PLUS. Are a PLUS,I had the original earbuds and they were very good. But the Galaxy earbuds plus are worth the extra money. With improved audio and longer battery life. I also like the range on these better. Noise cancelling should have been added. But maybe on the next ones. I really do love the quality of these Galaxy earbuds plus. They sound great!!! I am true owner of these and have had them about a week.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,Better sound,I like the way they feel . Sound quality is amazing in my opinion. Can't compare to galaxy buds 2019 but sound better than jabra elite 65t.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,The best TWS buds I currently used,"The new virsion earbuds are the best pair I used, they have fast and perfect connection between single or both earbuds and devices. The sound is pretty good except when I played Red Alert 3. Compaired with music and background sounds in video, the human voice is relatively weak. Meanwhile, sometime the sound seems a little bit wired. (I dont know whether it is issue of stream source or defect of buds) . All in all, currently sumsung +buds seem like the best choice, compared with other TWS products, such as airpod, sennheiser momentum, powerbeats, hammerhead."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-21,"If your debating between of buds, buds plus, or airpods pro I would recommend the buds plus.","I already noticed a difference compared to the og galaxy buds. Battery life and ambient mode for me have been the biggest difference. My wife can also understand me when I call her and no longer sounds like I'm talking through a tin can. Hands down worth the price. I used to have the airpods pro as well, but due to a defect i had to return it. I loved the ambient mode on them but honestly I like the galaxy buds plus ambient mode just a touch better. The og buds sucked in this department. I liked the active noise cancelation (anc) on the airpods pro but it would give me a headache after 30 min. So to be $100 less than the airpods pro and perform equally, and in some areas better than the pro, with the dropped anc feature is worth it imo. If your debating between of buds, buds plus, or airpods pro I would recommend the buds plus. If your an apple user the pros are a great option but any Android user would benefit more from the buds plus than the pro in every way."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,"It's good, but not great","Not as good as my old pair of 65T, but they have a way better ambient mode and look sleek."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,The best ear buds out there!,"Great product, definitely better then the first gen galaxy buds! Samsung is the best!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-22,Better battery life. That's about it!,Unless having the latest or just the improved battery. I really do not see the price justified. The original buds are better in my opinion minus the amazing battery life the Buds + give the user. If you don't want the fingerprints all over your case I suggest staying away from the black buds. I cannot speak for the other available colors.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Worth the money,Love it much better than the last version love the improvements
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-22,El volumen es muy bajo sin activar el sonido cambiental.,"La música o sonidos de los videos es muy baja y si cancelas el SONIDO AMBIENTAL no escuchas nada de música, mal producto por este precio con 40 dólares compras algo con las mismas características. La batería soporta escuchando música 10 hrs pero no 16 como las características dicen."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-22,Fit is critical for quality sound and can be hard to achieve and maintain,"When fitting properly these have great sound, rich bass, nice mid and treble. Samsung provides 3 different ear rings and 3 different tips to help you attain the proper fit. Proper fit means these buds fit your ear canal snuggly, and stay snug. My issue with them is that after trying all the various combinations of ear ring and tip sizes I was never able to get a snug fit that stayed snug. The rich sound would, over 20 minutes or so, start to sound ""tinny"". I would then push and twist them back in, and they would sound good again for a short while, till they slipped a bit. By a bit I am talking about a fraction of a millimeter, even that little makes a difference. Forget about exercising or running, that creates too much motion for them to stay properly fitted. I don't have this problem at all with Apple earpod pros. As an Android guy this saddens me, I hate paying premium for Apple products."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Amazing fit and sound,Definitely an improvement in fit from the original buds. Sound is a 10/10.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Very impressive through and through,"I've tried many true wireless headphones. Compared to the said to be king of Sony xm whatever the effs, they're better for a couple reasons. The Sonys sound better but they over compress the sound which I don't like. If you don't know what that means basically as the volume gets louder they can press it more so the clarity stays the same. On the other hand the Galaxy buds don't have the sound quality as far as range as a Sony but you don't lose quality as the volume goes up and it definitely gets louder on the Galaxy buds then on Sony. Also the Ambient sound is way better on the Galaxy buds which is why I bought them along with the fact that they are more Contour to your ear and I bought them mostly to ride my dirt bike long distances with music and also being able to hear my bike. And the Galaxy buds will last longer on those long bike rides. The case quality on both seems about the same but the Sony case is so big it would be hard to travel with in your pocket whereas the Galaxy buds is much easier to conceal. Overall I'm much happier with these than the Sony. On multiple levels. Honestly who needs adaptive sound when I set my headphones away I want I like them to stay there."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Worth it,"Battery life is great, sound is great, it does a good job at noise canceling but it doesnt have active noise canceling, which isnt a big deal, it does well enough by itself
Sleek and very portable, case is glossy so fingerprint magnet, but i plan on getting a Dbrand Skin or case"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-22,Samsung lied!! No multi device support!,I bought these only because Samsung said you could connect multiple devices. That was an outright lie. It's no wonder people by Apple products. Every other manufacture either make's low quality or lies. Never again will I buy another Samsung product!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Great earbuds,"Way to go Samsung, I love the fit, sound is second to none, noise reduction is great and the ability to allow some sound through is great for work in my case. Fit is great I have small ear canals and these fit perfectly."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Wow wow woW,These things are awesome! First time Galaxy Buds user and opted for the + model. These have great battery life on a single charge for about 11 hours and another 11 from the case...like wow that's a big upgrade from the old Galaxy Buds. Sound is crisp and not too bassy but just enough thump to make you nod to the low ends. Make sure to download the Galaxy Wearabe App to unlock its features. Pairs well with my Galaxy Note 10+. The buds themselve are shipped with about half volume making it sound low when turned up high on the phone side. I was underwhelmed until I found out the app has commands you can change like tapping volume up or down. So make sure to make the buds themselves 100% volume and it makes it a whole lot better. Ambient aware is amazingly clear because of the additional mic making it 3 instead of 2 from last buds. Thus making calls is a breeze from the other party hearing your voice more clearly. Samsung really stepped up their Galaxy Buds lineup.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,awsome !!!,now they last all day for me :)
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-22,Decent earbuds with glaring but avoidable issues,"I do plan on editing this review once I get my replacement buds. The pair I got was (I'm hoping) defective where if I left the buds out of the case for more than 2-3 minutes they would unsynchronize from each other and the only sound I'd hear are high pitched glitches. The only options to fix that would be to reset the buds through the Galaxy Wearable app or put them back in the case for a couple of minutes. I highly doubt the developers would force the users to constantly be wary of whether their buds are either charging or in use at all times. EDIT: the new pair had similar issues, Soni was hoping it was just some specific software glitch. After a couple of updates, it seems to be working a lot better. The ambience mode tends to force the buds to de-sync once in a while, so I just have it off at all times. Other than that, pretty decent earbuds with poor bass but decent noise cancellation."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-02-22,False Advertisement,"Upgraded from gen 1 galaxy buds expecting to use the mutipoint connect feature between my Windows tablet and phone. This feature is ONLY available on Galaxy phones with SmartThings installed. This is strictly a software decision and could easily be incorporated to all devices, but Samsung decided to be proprietary and give false advertisement. Not worth the upgrade."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Great fit out of the box!,Out of the box the fit was perfect. They come with different sizes but I didn't need to change. The battery last all night. Fast charging and a nice small case. Works with Samsung Wearable app which allows control of the buds sound like bass and other types. Shows battery status of buds and case and software updates. These are so much better then Bose Free SoundSport (bad fit and battery life) and Echo Buds (bad fit and battery). I wish I could return both but I waited too long. I recommend them.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,All good,Super good as expected
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Amazing product for the price,I own two pairs of orginal g buds black and yellow and I love them. But I got to say the g buds + are a great upgrade with Independent ambient sound when you have one ear Bud in is fantastic and the sound upgrade is superb gotta say over all great buy for the money and a great upgrade if you looking for a slights audio upgrade and features upgrade
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-23,Meh.,"These are okay. I just got them in the mail. I’m using them now. They’re not much louder (if any louder) than the $5 headphones that I bought at WalMart. I’m not trying to hate. I love Samsung. But these are lackluster. Battery life seems ok I guess. I haven’t used them enough to see but they haven’t died in 2 hours so I’ll give them a 4 star for that aspect. But overall, these are just okay. I definitely was NOT blown away. I’m actually disappointed considering how much I paid for these."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Great item,Great product
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-23,"Excellent product, however, not for audiophiles","Excellent product overall. I owned the previous generation Galaxy buds and was very happy. This generation seems to have made major improvements on some of my biggest criticisms from the last ones. 1. Phone call quality significantly improved. The additional microphone dramatically helps with reducing noise on the other party's end, helping them hear me much better. Very pleased with this improvement. 2. Battery life is apparently much better, without compromising size. They're slightly bigger than the 1st gen, but not by much. 3. I would really love to see some Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). That is one feature making me consider the Echo Buds over the Galaxy buds+; however, I understand Samsung rather focus on improving battery life rather than offsetting that improved battery life with ANC. I have Bose Quiet Comfort Noise Cancelling heardphones, so if i wanted ANC I could just use those. You get decent passive noise isolation with properly occluding earpieces. 4. Ambient Noise mode also significantly improved. The 1st gen was rather lousy. I like that you can adjust the ambient volume. Very useful when I'm at work talking to my assistant without having to remove them. 5. Sound quality is decent. They boast a dual driver woofer/tweeter. I frankly don't perceive any marked improvement over the 1st gen which is a little disappointing. If you're looking for high-fidelity immersive sound, these aren't for you. If you want some that sound decent, these will do. Overall pleased. Happy with my decision. This is worth upgrading if the 1st gen features were slightly disappointing. People who talk on the phone a lot will really appreciate these buds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,"Dont wait, save the $100 for these instead of airpods just sound different",These earphones are honestly worth it. The lab features and the earphones had upgraded specs with 22 hours of battery life in total with charging case. iOS compatibility smoothly and there is an option to have it on where if you tap the tip if your ear you can adjust the volume level like that due to the experimental feature but you have to turn it on manually
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-24,Can you ear me now?,"These are my first set of this type of ear buds. The sound quality is very good, so long as the buds are in correctly and that can take some finagling to get them just right. Everyone's ears are a little different, so it might not be as much of an issue with others as it is for me. I have to really push and twist these around to get a good seal. Once set, they seem to stay put. I wish they had a way to adjust the bass to and individuals preference rather than the presets, but dynamic sounds pretty good to me, especially with Amazon's HQ and Ultra HQ songs. Build quality seems really good and they are reasonably comfortable at least for the short time I have had them. One other thing, Don't Lose the Charging base. I see they cannot be replaced and you will have to buy a whole new set of buds. I bought a zippered fob key case with a snap hook on it to keep mine in. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,WOW!,"I had the original. This is much better. The sound quality is spot on. The features are almost all there. I only wish you could connect to two phones at the same time. Its a pain in the butt to have to switch between my work phone and personal phone. However, this is my only complaint. I am very happy with these buds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,Slight improvement,Passive noise cancelling but the ambient mode is 🔥 and they fit really nice. It's a slight improvement from the original earbuds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,Samsung definitely got these right,Amazing sound and call quality. Very comfortable and the touchpad commands work great. I cant even tell they are there most of the time tbh
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-24,Everything was good except for a battery life,"I had so much hope for them but as I got tired trying to find a good, reliable pair of true wireless. I started with Samsung Galaxy original but since I am iPhone user I couldn’t use all the futures. I tried Beats PowerPro which were too uncomfortable, I tried Jabra 75t that kept were emitting high pitch noise from the left earbuds, Sony WFXM100M3 which were failing from my ears and finally Galaxy Buds+. Buds+ sound very nicely. They are not as loud as Jabra but they have enough volume for me as I was listening at 80% and with music playing I couldn’t hear anything around me. Hear through feature works exceptionally well and mics quality was excellent as I carried few conversations while walking along busy street and person on another side never complained but rather said that I sounded clear. Fit is ok, not as snug as Jabra but definitely better than Sony’s. Fit is always my concern as neither old wired or winless AirPods fit me at all. They are just falling out of ears even when I sitting still. So you would ask why only 3 stars then for Buds+...well...it’s a battery. I believe that I had received defective unit since the time I opened the case, left earbud has 10% less battery then the right one. I charged them both for 3 hours and they came up to a 100% and as long as they were in the case, the remained the same but as soon I would start using them at the same time, left earbud would discharge much faster. After taking them fully charged and listening to podcast for about an hour, right earbud was at 97% but left at 85%. But that wasn’t all, after I placed buds in the case and left them charge for an hour, they both came up to 100% but case’s battery dropped to 52%. I tried to discharge them, reset them, and left them charge overnight connected to wall outlet, but nothing had helped. Battery was discharging unevenly between earbuds and too fast for the case so after a week I decided to return them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-02-24,Started to Hurt,"These were ok, at first these didn’t hurt like other earbuds did for me, such as Jabra 75t, or the AirPods Pro. But after a handful of days, they started to hurt and just starting to tear up the inside my ears. It’s tough to find ones that truly fit inside your ears as there are no two ears that are alike. So I will go back to the Sony’s XM3’s as they are held in place by the actual earbud tip, as oppose to the actual plastic housing as all the other earbuds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,Close to perfect,"I've tried a ton of different wireless earbuds (Airpod Pros, sony wf-1000xm3, libratone track air, bose, among many others) and every pair has it's pros and cons - it's difficult to find that perfect pair. Although not perfect, I think the Galaxy Buds+ offer the closest thing to perfection on the market. They can be worn all day without discomfort, they stay in my ears pretty well during vigorous workouts, sound quality is great, call quality is great, aesthetics and button control on side is great. My only complaint would be lack of active noise canceling, but because they seal sound out so well, I don't really see the need for it - it blocks ambient sound just as good as the leading ANC earbuds (apple and sony). Highly recommend these headphones."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,Amazing,No dislike
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-02-24,very nice for the price ios user but hurts my ear,"sound quality isn't that impressive compared to my AirPods 2 tbh i like the sound of the airpods better, don't expect to be blown away. some pros about the galaxy buds are, better battery life, call quality is nice, and a hundred dollars cheaper over the pros. I also own the pros and like the sound quality better on those and are more comfortable, also the pros transparency mode sound more clear over the galaxy buds plus ambient mode. the galaxy earbuds make my ears hurt. Overall, I'll recommend getting the pros if you are an ios user but if you are not looking to spend that kind of money go with these they are a great alternative."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-24,Love em,Great battery life and a nice upgrade from the last year Galaxy buds.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-24,"Does not multi device, well.... only with samsung tablets and phones.","I was so excited to hear that the new buds would multi device (which was a main feature for me). Sound and all that is good. I live by the ambient sound feature. The app that controls there buds is awesome. battery life exactly what i needed. I have a note 9 so the connection is seamless all you have to do is open the case and it does everything. Controls are almost fluid (still have to get volume to work more frequently)
Now onto Samsung's half truth. Multi device was was not stated clearly by Samsung. It does have it but only works with other Samsungs tablets. I Don't think it works with their laptops which is a shame. If the multi device feature doesn't apply to you this is where its at, no doubt."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-24,Beautiful sound and call quality.,"Love them! I have nothing bad to say about them. Sound quality is there, but more important, call quality! I'm a professional chef and I can use them in the loud kitchen environment and nobody's complained with the call quality so far. They didn't notice the difference between my phone and the galaxy buds. I use it with my new Galaxy Note 10 Plus. Coming from iPhone, I can say I don't miss anything!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,Works with iOS,"Great for workout and occasional use. Although the battery last pretty long too. You can finally use the Ambience mode with iOS through Galaxy wear buds APP.
Definitely worth the upgrade and better cost-to-utility ratio than AirPods"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-25,Great improvement,Great improvement. Is a combination of the original ICON X and Galaxy ear buds. They sound great and fitment is extremely good.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-25,Poor sound quality,"Sound quality was very disappointing. I bought them based on consumer reports saying good sound, but it didn't deliver. I have some great workout music that I love with strong bass, but it was tinny and weak on these Samsung buds plus. I then tried Beats and Bose, and only the Bose delivered the full bass and range I was looking for, with great ambient noise islation as well."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-25,Awesome ear buds,"Feels great, looks great, I have the pixel 4 and the app makes the experience easy"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-25,Get them,"You will not be disappointed at all, huge improvement from the old buds. if ur thinking of getting the airpods pros do not, these beat it by specs and price! Your getting more. Look up YouTube reviews. And hear what everyone is saying."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-25,Selling my Bose SoundSport Free,"Awesome sound, noise isolation, features, all the YouTube video reviews agree... these are THE best tiny buds. Such a low profile, I bet I can get my full face helmet over them - will try later. I have no desire to try to use these on the plane as the Bose 700 is the king (over the ear is the best) and I would hate to drop one of these tiny buds - I may never find it again. I've had MANY earphones and headphones over the years and for an in the ear bud, these are the best. I can't compare with any of the Apple garbage, but I just saw a comparo and the guy said these sounded better - and a $100 dollars cheaper - go figure."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-26,Liberated!,Smartest decision I ever made on headphones. Go wireless! Pairs perfectly with my Galaxy A20.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-26,Disappointed,The picture of the product shown that I order was not the same arrived in the package.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-26,I just wish you could use voice assistant with out giving up anything,I love these ear buds they sound like 220 dollars ear buds great better than the first ones
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-27,Comfort-sound-clear calls,"Talk about a upgrade. Let's hit in the main aspects. 1. Fit-great fit and even when they feel a little loose while running due to sweat etc they dont fall out. Tested while running-jumping-biking. 2. Sound-clean sound that amplify on all levels clear and crisp
3. Comfort-I detail cars anywhere between 6-10 hrs non stop and I listen to podcast and music these are comfortable entire time and dont create a soreness in ear that previous model did. 4.battery-uhhh I die before they do...
5. Mic-this is super important as I need my hands to continue to work while on the line. I have gone through 5 or more different headsets including Bose-beats-jaybird-original samsung-jabra. All of them amplify the background noise which sucks for the person in other line when they hear the dishes you are cleaning louder then your voice. Samsung cleaned that up on the Buds plus by adding in ambient noise cancelling for the mic. Works for either ear piece solo or together. Only thing I have not tested is water resistance...ATT warranty covers that. Go buy these guys because for the price you wont find a better headset."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-27,"Great sound quality, ambient noise control and battery life.","Surprisingly good sound quality, with bass and treble response good. The battery seems to last a long time I have yet to run it down to below 50% before putting them back into the case and the case charging them back to full is convenient. Comfortable in the ear during use, using default attachments, this can vary so make sure you try the different sizes. I have a galaxy S8+ phone and I did have to change the advanced bluetooth setting ""Media Volume Sync"" to ON in order to get good volume, with this setting off it was half of what it should have been. Once done it sounded great."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-27,Good to go!,Sound is very good. Do wish there was a customizable EQ though. Fit is perfect.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-27,Great upgrade from first generation Galaxy Buds,"The Galaxy Buds+ exceeded my expectations as an upgrade from the model released last year. There is little change in the appearance of the devices but the battery life improvement alone is worth considering a purchase of the Buds+. Nearly doubling from 6 to 11 hours of life without a noticeable change in the size of the buds is a feat and the somewhat small change to display the battery capacity of the case along with the buds in the app is an important improvement. Call quality is also greatly improved on the Buds+ and I was already happy with the original set. Finally the Ambient Sound setting is incredible on the Buds+. When set to the maximum level the Buds+ act almost like hearing aids. I work in an environment where I need to keep headphones in while listening to music or making calls but also need to be able to hear what's going on in my surroundings, the Ambient Sound modes enable me to enjoy music quietly while not disconnecting myself from coworkers through the day."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-28,So far the best buds I've ever owned,"So I tried several similar products borrowing from my friends to test and never found anything I really liked. I heard about the newest version of these being out and thought that given my past experience with the older versions this would be a good choice and so far these are by far the best buds I've ever used. Not exceptional quality like my Bose Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Headphones 700, which would be unfair since they are $400, but still a very good sound quality, very easy connection to all my devices and their app is reliable and easy to use."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-28,Great battery life and all day comfort,For a person like me that wears them all day the battery life is great. Checked them after about 3 hours today and still had 70% battery life left. Really comfortable. Very pleased with them so far. I did return the first set because it seemed to have a bluetooth connection issue and the replacement set is working great.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-28,Okay,"Only one ear piece and one size doesn't fit all. I find myself pushing them in to get better sound. They don't fall out. They just get loose. The galaxy wearable software is okay, but there's no volume control on the bud. There is an ambience mode with 3-4 loudness settings that enable the buds to act like cheap hearing aids, which is nice. I give it 3.5 stars."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-29,great sound. bad boost and treble,"there great for sound and the features are a must to have. i will say the boost and treble are not that great compared to other earbuds. but other then that i say, get em..but not for the price there asking for
i say try to get them on sale."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-29,Nice fit and holds good,I have no clue if there the plus since it just says Samsung buds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,0,2020-02-29,Buds+ case has a battery issue.,"There's been reports of the case laing percentage even when not actively charging the buds. I did my own tests and the case definitely seems to have an efficiency problem. Disclaimer : I didn't use ambient sound at all during testing. I put ear buds into case. Waited until buds were maxed. Time : 2:53 am eastern time. Left 100% (up 13%), Right 100% (up 10%), Case 77% (down 22%)
Checked at 7am (4 hours later), all percentages exactly the same
7:42 am
Used buds on way to work. (90 minute commute)
9am
Left 94% (down 6%), Right 94%(down 6%), Case 77% (stayed the same)
9:30 am
Left 100% (up 6%), Right 100% (up 6%) Case 62% (down 15%)
2:30pm
Left 100%, Right 100%, Case 61% (down 1%)
4:30pm
Used for 10 minutes
Left 99% (down 1%), Right 99 (down 1%), case 57% (down 4%)
5pm
Left 100%(up 1%), Right 100% (up 1%), Case 47% (down 10%)
Summary
Totals. Buds were charged 37% throughout the day, while the case itself dropped 53%. Conclusion? This case may be bad honestly. I don't think this case is working as intended. I'm wondering if this is an isolated issue, or it's much more widespread. Either this was a defective unit or this a much bigger issue that Samsung will need to address. The buds themselves are awesome."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-29,The best true wireless headphones,"Good sound, great battery life, and even has an app to remap touch actions. They fit in my ears well and the charging case is small enough to fit comfortably in my pocket. Basically everything I could ask for in true wireless headphones without completely breaking the bank. My only note is the call quality, unless I raise my voice it is hard for the other person to hear me. Even than it still seems to have trouble picking up my voice at times. However, considering I never intended to use them for calls I will not knock points off."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-29,Highly recommend,Just recently got these. They're my first Galaxy Bus and I Love them! Lots of useful features. Highly recommend.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-29,Amazing purchase! One flaw.,"The sound is amazing and the feel is great! I've never felt more comfortable using them.The ambient sound feature makes it great choice when going on the bus or the metrorail, can hear everyone clearly! However the one flaw is that my buds tend to disconnect or give distorted sounds when I have my phone in my pocket or blocking direct line of sight between the buds and my phone. Granted it is uncommon but a nuisance when it does happen. Overall, a great purchase!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-29,Not impressed,Sound quality is poor. I personally do not recommend this product.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-29,good investment,"very good, best investment ever i cant compare them to the original but these are amazing buy u a pair u guys"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-29,Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus,"I purchase the Samsung Galaxy buds plus in Black, and when I open up the buds case to connect them to my device my Animation Display is White. Every video I see have the black Animation when you own the black Galaxy Buds plus accept mine. However when I go into the Galaxy wear app the display is Black in there. And the left ear bud sound lower then the right bud."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-29,Invasive permissions,"I don't believe I should have to give the app permission to my calendar just to be able to listen to music with these ear buds. If you try and deny any permission they ask for, the app will not work. It's disappointing as I like the sound produced but I am not comfortable with the required permissions. Samsung should give us a choice on permissions, but instead I have to choose to return them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Great earbuds!,I love these! They are much more convenient than my previous wireless earbuds.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Upgrade to Original Earbuds?,"I have the original Samsung Earbuds paired Samsung Galaxy S10+ 5G & Win 10 Laptop. Did not want to unpair old pair as they are 1 month old. Purchased these for home use, other pair as backup or in car. These plus buds paired easily with Windows 10. To use, go to Win 10 Sound settings and put Buds+ as device. They will work with music-videos on PC. When you close them in case, Win 10 will use PC speaker without having to change settings. Same if you use Buds first version. To install on Galaxy phone was another thing! Did not see them when opening case. Even on phone Bluetooth screen, it could not see Buds+. Tried Samsung Wearable app on phone, add device, could not see them. Restarted phone and tried again. Opened buds+ case and finally a pop-up to upgrade its software. Buds+ needs some additional plugins in order for the app to see the buds+. Once installed, it will change between original Buds & Buds+ depending on which one I want to use. Was tricky but after a few tries, they installed and both work. Was on phone with Samsung support who could not figure out what I was asking! Simple question was ""how do I install Buds+ BUT LEAVE ORIGINAL BUDS PAIRED WITH PHONE? All the time spent with them ""researching"", I figured it out. Then walked Samsung Support thru process. They should send me a check."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-01,A great product but not without some flaws,"These sound is great, I like that youre able to change the equalizer using the Galaxy Wearable app. The earbuds will still disconnect from my Galaxy Note 10+ sometimes. This is after updating to the newest software version. Hopefully Samsung works out the connectivity issues. Otherwise, I would recommend them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-01,"Disapponted, really wanted these to work for IOS.","I watched many good reviews on these and really wanted to try these out. But they must be really suited for Android and not IOS. I was able to pair them with my iPhone7 and could see them on the Galaxy app, but could not get the phone to go into headphone mode to get music out of the buds. I tried many of the fixes I found online and couldn't get music to play in headphone mode. The ambient feature works well and the find my ear buds feature was nice. But the primary function of playing sounds through the ear buds didn't ever materialize. I'm going to return them and spend the extra money on Airpods for the iPhone."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-01,The do it all buds,Best buds in the market for all they do.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-01,Big things small packages blah blah blah,"Downloading the app and setting it to “dynamic” is an absolute must. (Should be default don’t know why it’s not. Overall pretty good headphones. Some limitations because of size obviously, but they do a good job for casual use."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Best truly wireless earbuds,"These sound amazing, I'm ""upgrading"" from the original Galaxy Buds and those were already amazing. The sound quality is amazing, it's nicely balanced with great highs, and really good lows that you can feel audibly as opposed to physically. If you're on Android, you absolutely should purchase them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Best Buds Ever,Hands down 10 times better than the regular galaxy buds...Previous call made me sound under water..these are super clear...on both ends during a call and the music is CRYSTAL CLEAR....
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Excellent enough to give up ANC,"The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are well-priced and long-lasting wireless earbuds that may make you reconsider the need for active noise cancellation. After changing the silicone tips to ensure a fit for my ear with the included different sizes, the buds do a great job passively reducing noise by just blocking out sound, muting high pitched sounds and voices nearly as good (~80% airpods pro, ~30% Bose quietcomfort) as ANC products, though it doesn't block out lower frequencies well. The buds are comfortable and last for the whole day, and the ambient mode allows sound in with a touch of the buds so you can listen to your environment without taking the buds/music out. *Pros*
Long battery life - from 20 hours low use, 11 hours medium use, 8 hours high volume constant use, all without the case. With it, you can double it. No worries about running out of charge in the middle of the day. Comfortable to sleep with - the bud fits entirely in the ear (though this may not be the case with smaller ears) so I can even sleep on my side with them. This allows me to listen in bed without disturbing my housemates. Quick to recharge - if you fell asleep with them on, then it's no problem in the morning to pop them in the case for a couple of minutes to recharge and they'll be good to use for a good while (samsung claims 3 mins for an hour of playtime). So many buttons! - I can control volume up/down, play/pause, action left (previous track/video, for Audible previous 30s), action right (previous track/video, for Audible skip 30s), enable/disable Ambient mode, AND Google Voice command without touching the phone. The buttons are easy to use and responsive. To get the volume up/down ability, you need to enable an experimental feature which detects double tapping on the edge of the earbud (though I found that you can just tap on the back of your ear). Sound quality and modifications - the sound is really good for wireless earbuds (better than airpods pro), and you can choose from a set of preset equalizer modes. Size and weight - both the buds and the case are very lightweight. The case is small and easily pocketable, though it is a little too large to put on a keychain. Call quality - excellent call quality even in noisy situations. It's like active noise cancelling for whoever you are calling. I'm interested to see the next generation earbuds combine Apple's ANC and in-ear microsecond adjustments with Samsung's three-mic adaptive call system. Comfort - the buds are very comfortable (after changing the silicone wingtips to fit) which pairs well with the long battery life. Bluetooth signal - the buds can transmit around 40ft clear line of sight and 20ft through walls, though this will be limited by the transmitting device as well (tested with Samsung Note 10+). Built-in wireless charging - case comes with wireless charging capability. Water resistant - though not waterproof, the buds still work under mild splashing and recover from splashes with a paper towel. Stays in ear - there's is no way the earbud is coming out of your ear by accident. Even falling down, it stays in your ear. *Cons*
No active noise cancellation - loud buzzing, humming, car sounds, etc. is not well filtered by passive noise reduction. Would not recommend for frequent fliers who need to hear their music. No dual connection - these buds were originally advertised as being able to connect to two different devices at once, but the feature has since been removed from the product description. I'm optimistic this will change in a future firmware update. Ambient mode picks up high frequencies too well - I think the ambient mode picks up on the high frequencies (whistles, snaps, pops) of sounds too well. Using ambient mode on a windy day sounds like listening to wind through a mic (which it is!). Sound distortion - I use the buds with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Sometimes, when using the buds for a while with my phone in my pocket and then taking the phone out of my pocket, the sound briefly becomes slightly robotic before returning to normal. I think this has to do with how the buds adjust to signal strength to correct sound. Setup - you can pair without quickly, though to get additional support though the Galaxy Wear app, it takes a minute for the first setup. Logistics - the included charging cable is a little short. Overall, I think the quality and all-day usability of these earbuds warrants giving up ANC, especially since I am not in situations with lots of low frequency noise and since the buds already block out a lot of sound."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,best headphones,sound quality is amazing the upgrade to the battery life and ambient sound pick up is more than worth it to buy/upgrade too specially if you had the first generatrion galaxy buds.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Best clear sound.,"What I love about it is that is clear sound, you can also hear and speak to anyone without removing the buds from your ear it sounds like a microphone. You can wear one at a time. They have my approval."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Samsung so far fixed the issues with these,Samsung finally fixed the issue with the phone calls. Happy so far
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Great upgrade from version 1,Great upgrade in every way from the first Samsung improvement. Can't wait until the next upgrade. Hope they go next tier with sound and equalizer
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-02,Decent wireless buds,The earbuds themselves are great. Not as loud as I expected but the bass and quality are great. The ambient feature works awesome so I can use them with work. Earbud battery lasts about a day. The pack itself seems to need about 2 charges per day with heavy daily use. Great set up for us Android users!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,Love them.,The earphones fit well and they do not constantly slip out of my ears like almost every wireless ear buds I've ever had except for the Bose sport. For a second I thought they were not loud enough until I realized I could turn the volume up manually on the earphones feel application and tapping them on the outer edges. Then my eardrums where almost Blown Away with high quality Sound and Bass. First wireless earbuds where I will decline to turn the volume all the way up. YouTube videos do not Give them Justice. Ambient sound improves your hearing better than your normal hearing Considering that the Ambient sound is volume control at three levels. I love hearing my own voice Amplified as I'm singing along with my music. Samsung must have done this purposely. I can also listen to my earphones on Bluetooth and the music on another Bluetooth device such as my car or my JBL Charge 4. And must I add again that they do not slip out of my ears and at one point I could not even feel them in there standing still. However like almost all ear phones that are not memory foam do have pressure points in your ear Exhausted from wearing them for long periods of time.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,"Great sound, long battery life. Better then the original buds","I had last years model and these have a definitely noticeable sound quality improvement. The microphones also have been improved. I love the the charging case pairs with my phone and i can see how charged it is on my phone. They are super light and with the different fittings they fit my ears perfectly. I can run, jump and work with them in without them falling out and not even notice they there other than the amazing sound."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,Great true wireless buds with bit battery problem,"As some other mentioned in a review, for my unit the right earbud drains faster than the left one. The screenshot shows ~30min use and the right bud is at 95% battery while the left one is still 100%. On the bright side they’re Lightweight and comfortable to wear for a long time. They sound very good and actually follow the Harman target curve really closely if you have seen reviews from rtings."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,Geat Quality,Worth every penny.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,0,2020-03-02,Microphone is a deal killer,"I bought some of these at Costco for $100. I like a lot about them. You can use either bud by itself. The case/charger is secure, yet it can be opened by one hand. The sound was fine. But people on the other end of phone calls had difficulty hearing me. It seemed to be worse when there was background noise. Best Buy says that they've had to return a lot of these because of the microphone issue. Costco gave me my money back."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-02,Not loud,Super quiet even on full volume
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-03,Best headphones I've used,So glad I got these. I was already using the original buds everyday. The plus sounds even better and the ambient sound is very impressive.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-03,Fantastic upgrade -- worth every penny,Improved battery and call quality over original. Very pleased.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-03,Good features and sound,"When it comes to wireless earbuds I more sound and features kind of guy. If the earbuds have good features but do not sound good I will not buy them. If they have good sound and ok features I may consider them, but when it comes to the Samsung buds plus they are really worth it sound is amazing and love the touch feature and especially the feature that allows ambient noise so you can hear the outside while wearing your buds. If i had to compare these buds between the Bose soundSport wireless earbuds for 200 these Samsung buds plus do not compare anything to the Bose soundSport. If you are looking for earbuds and you are looking at Bose because its a well known brand, save your self the time and get the Samsung buds plus for 148 instead of spending 200 and you get more features that the Bose SoundSport does not have and the sound is louder to and sounds better. Now with the Samsung buds plus you may not get the good thumping you want like you do with the Bose but you can change the equalizer to one of the presets to your liking. To make a long story short, These are the best wireless buds i have ever owned. It is not about the price that makes the buds better. its about the brand and quality and how they sound. I am surprised to say that a 148 pair of earbuds are better then a 200 dollar buds. You would think the high dollar ones are better but that is not always the case. You never know til you try the product out. I have hear reviews that say the sound is not wow taking and i have heard reviews that these are fantastic buds and I'm going to agree with the fantastic buds. Sorry to all for making a long review but the more detail the better the review and the more it helps others understand the awesomeness in these Samsung buds plus."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-03,Does what it’s intended to do!,"I bought these as a birthday day gift for my boyfriend. He was using my first gen Apple AirPods. But he loves these!! He enjoys the sound quality and how easy it is to pair them with his Samsung phone. There’s also multiple ear piece sizes that are great, it’s also a wireless charging case, and battery life has been decent for him, for all that you get, it’s a fair price!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-03,Made me believe in Samsung again,I bought these through samsung but let me first say I am apple all the way from iPhone iPad to airpods all generation including pros. I'm really invested in earbuds and headphones but lete say I had my doudts on these but had to give them a try. When it came to battery life blew my mind was an hour more then said on med volume. Sound quality is excellent I would say just as good as pros. Comfort is better then my pros the pros often hurt my ear like a suction type hurt these I have slept with them on. Call quality excellent but I feel pros had a bit more clarity on both ends of speakering and hearing. There is no noise cancelation which pros is so amazing I love playing with it but putting these in correctly make a good block of outside noise. The touch sensor I wish wasn't so sensitive but in all I find myself reaching for these more then my pros lately. Just make sure you get the app made a difference once I updated them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-03,Pues que digan que tanto tienen de volumen,Pues no tienen mucho volumen y
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-03,Good buy.,These were a big upgrade for me I still can't belive how good and easy to use these are.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-04,Best voice quality,"I have purchased over 50 different wireless earbuds over the last 3 years. My main concern is comfort and above all else that my wife doesn't complain about having trouble hearing me when talking on the phone using the earbuds. This is the first pair that I have had no complaints about. People can hear me fine while in the car driving 80Mph, while in a noisy office, in a hotel room standing near a noisy air conditioner, and walking to the car on a windy day. My only complaint is that i wish they had a vent to reduce pressure in my ear and allow noise through without hardware/software magic. Without the vent they are still the most comfortable earbuds I have ever owned."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-04,Amazing I love them,I love them more than any other ear buds that I've owned but they arent Water resistant at all supposedly and mine only last around 8-9 hours but they are still amazing and last longer than any others out there plus they sound amazing and you cant even feel them in your ears hardly even after 9 hours straight I love them and that's why I love everything Samsung lol
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-04,Overpriced and disappointing,"Summary: not worth the hype. Instead, buy Sennheiser Momentum earbuds. You won’t look back. I tested Apple AirPods vs Samsung Buds+ (2020) vs Sennheiser Momentum. The Samsung Buds+ have received a ton of buzz but the sound comes up flat, dry and bass is underwhelming. The app is tough to find online, especially in the Apple App Store. The app offers preset eq levels, but in order to really hear a difference in the bass you need to place it on the “clear” setting and then to the bass options. Even then, sounds thin. They also hurt my ears after 30 minutes of use and their waterproof rating is weak. I was surprised, as I thought the Apple AirPods would be the ones that received the lowest review of the three that I tested, but the Samsung Buds+ actually sound slightly weaker than the Apple AirPods. I plan on returning the Samsung Buds+ now that I have a pair of the Sennheiser Momentum earbuds. The Apple AirPods are positioned to sound crisp and clear, especially on phone calls. They certainly meet the expectations in this area, but the bass is weak, dry and airy. Good on the treble and at higher frequencies. If you aren’t all about the rich, depth sounds then save the difference in price between these Sennheiser earbuds and go with the Apple AirPods. The AirPods are light and easy to recharge. As are the Samsung Buds+ and the Momentum. The Sennheiser Momentum is on a level by itself. Sound quality that sounds like you have a mini home theater in your ears. With an ability to customize the eq in their app, sound engineers will geek out because it looks like something you would see in the studio and the casual customer will realize these should be the standard which all other high-end wireless speakers should be measured against. These are surprisingly light weight as well. Battery life is a little on the short side but if you’re looking to buy wireless earphones for sound and sound alone, stop reading other reviews, stop researching and buy the Sennheiser Momentum earbuds. Samsung is fine, but for the price point, they should be priced less than $90. I tested jazz, hip hop, latin and rock on all three products. All genres set at their default eq levels (to attempt to normalize my experiment). Sennheiser beat all of these models by a long shot. If you are able to pay for $150 earbuds, make the move and go for the Sennheiser Momentum at $200. Apple AirPods are $150. They are better than decent but less than great. The Sennheiser Momentum earbuds are excellent. The top of the Sennheiser case is actually kind of flimsy with a very thick and sturdy base. I can’t think of anyone who would say this is a make-or-break issue. I hope this helps you. I found it frustrating that there are so many reviews online but no one who would just cut to the chase. Either way, enjoy!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-04,"Total fraud, do not buy from Amazon","Do not buy galaxy ear from Amazon just received ear budds 10 minutes ago, open box and nothing inside box. No charge cable, no ear budds. And Serial number outside box was peeled off."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-04,Very Pleased with My Buds,"I am thoroughly enjoying the purchase of my Samsung Galaxy Buds + wireless ear buds. I have purchased numerous wireless ear buds from different manufacturers and these are by far the most comfortable ones that I have purchased. They are light weight, sound great and most of all I can wear them continuously without bothering my ears or making my ears feel itchy inside. These buds have a lot of different features that I have yet to explore, but out of the box, they were easy to set up on my Samsung Note 8, and all of the features explained in the quick start guide worked just like the instructions said. I also noted that after using them continuously for 6 hours, when I put them back in the case, the battery indicator in the app showed that I had 60% of the battery still available. Needless to say, I am very pleased and highly recommend these to other buyers."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-04,Perfect gift!,I got these for my boyfriend as he is a galaxy user and I got myself AirPods because I love my apple products! I will be returning my AirPods in exchange for these as the music quality is better and the ear phones are more comfortable in your ear! In fact mine get here today and I am stoked!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-04,This old guy likes,"I've held off on wireless earbuds because the sound quality and function just wasn't there. Decided to jump in with these and I have no regrets. I've recently been traveling more for work and the ambient sound feature is great. Walk up to the rental car counter and turn on ambient sound, finish my business and ambient back off. No pulling an earbud out to hear. Phone calls sound great. I've asked several people how I sounded on a call and they all said fine. Even in challenging high noise environments. Only complaint is not having control over all touch assignments. Assigned volume control to the user defined option but would also like to turn on and off ambient."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-05,Unsure.....,After a few days of using these headphones one ear starting sounding lower then the other. I tried resetting them but it didn't do anything. if I could get this fits I like these headphones overall. Still waiting for Amazon tech to call me back to troubleshoot this over the phone.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,So high quality,I am sooooooo happy they work great cant wait to use them in the gym !! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,Best purchase ever!,Some of the best earbuds I have ever had! I've been looking for earbuds with the ambient sound feature and these are great! I love how they even have updates for the earbuds themselves and that they have a lab function so you can try new things they are working on adding.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-05,Boom Boom Boom,Love these. Best money can buy.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-05,For iPhone owners - Awesome!!,"These are terrific for iPhone users! Apple earbuds were too loose. Samsung Buds fit great but didn’t pair well. Fit - My ear canal is a bit larger. I typically need to use the bigger spare bud size. Both med and large fit my ears really well but the large seals better so it brings out the base. Also, the Apple ones are loose in my ear. These are tight but not uncomfortable. I can already tell these are going to be great for snowboarding. Pairing (IMPORTANT) - It is a bit confusing. Pairing starts as soon as you open the case if your Bluetooth is on. But my buds+ had no sound. I had to pair my earpiece separately. Worked fantastic as soon as I paired both. Sound - The Buds did not work with my iPhone at all. The Buds+ has full functionality. App, sound settings, mic, etc...all works great!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-05,Crackling distortion on the high frequencies...,"Im getting some crackling distortion on the high tones, is this a defective pair or is this something I can fix changing the codecs or something?? Can someone give me some tips, please... sending them back would be a expensive and slow, I'm outside of the US now... It's a very big shame because I love everything else about these earphones. Lows are good and midtones are warm and sharp... But There is a bit of crackling on the higher frequently even though sounds on the lows and the middles are good but it's driving me crazy, once you hear it just messes up the whole experience... I hope that it's something software related that can be corrected... But it just sounds like old stereo tweeters that are exploded... I don't hear this with other Bluetooth earphones or my wired Sony earphones. They are paired with A Note 9."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-05,Sounds better than ipods,"Sounds better than the galaxy buds, but the bass is not as strong, but the highs are better. I like listening to music loud. Too bad they can't go as loud as i would like them too but it's probably because of the volume on the phone. when i have them on, i cant really hear anything around me,so i don't think noise cancelling matters unless you're around heavy traffic and construction or something."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,Buy Them,I really loved my original Galaxy buds but these things take them to a whole new level not only do they look great the sound is fantastic and call quality has greatly improved! Battery life is off the charts great
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,Stop reading this review and buy them!,"This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon. These earbuds are that good! The sound quality is phenomenal, and the CALL QUALITY is fantastic! Huge improvement over the previous echo buds. I bought these primarily to use for conference calls, and they do not disappoint. No one could even tell that I was using earbuds. The pass-through feature is great as well, and I love being able to adjust the amount of ambient noise coming in. Turning the feature up to high effectively gives you superhuman hearing which is pretty neat, but I generally keep that setting a bit lower. Battery life is unparalleled. I can use these all day and still have half a charge left. The only thing I can think to complain about is the case. The case for the Galaxy Buds+ is glossy, as opposed to the originals which had a matte case. It collects a lot of fingerprints. That's just me being unnecessarily nitpicky - it obviously doesn't effect the performance of the buds at all and should definitely not steer you away from getting these. They're great, that's all I can say!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,"Easy to use, good touch system, Samsung wearable helps in love",Omg I just loved it !! The best earbuds I have ever tried before !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-06,Do not fit,"These Comply earpieces say on the package ""made exclusively for Galaxy Buds"" but they do not fit the Galaxy Buds+ at all even though Amazon description says they do. These foam earpads are so loose they fall right off and are unusable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-06,"Definitely worth buying, especially if you're using 2019 Galaxy Buds",This new version of Galaxy Buds are so much better than the last ones. The wings help them fit better this time and really help with noise cancellation. When talking on the phone my voice is all people can here now (the last version made people hear EVERYTHING around me) and I can barely here what's going on around me. The ambient sound feature (to let in the noise around me) is a lot better too. The battery life is almost double of the last version and they seem to also charge faster as well. Definitely worth spending the money for the upgraded product.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-06,They are ridiculous good not perfect but I love them,"Love: sound quality, connectivity, commands, reading messages, that my family dont have to say what? I cant hear you well! on phone calls. Ambient sound, it works terrific, it can be abit loud at the beginning, but you get used to it. The greatest thing about it it's that I dont have to take them off when I go to my customer, and this has made the experience with these Samsung buds plus even more amazing. I wish: eventhough the speakers are way better than the last year model, more improvements on them will make them perfect. But I love this buds plus the technology on these little bluetooth is amazing and obviously 100 cheaper than the new airpods pro, I like the design better than the airpod pro's. They stay on my ears well eventhough I'm up and down and moving for 9 hrs at work, plus battery life amazing. I'm considering a pair for my wife, but they need to come down at least 30 dollars. And no I'm not getting pay to say all these I almost never rate things that I buy but I wanted to do it on these."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-06,Best airbuds thus far,Its everything it said they were well worth the money I have a galaxy s10 plus I have tried 4 different kind of airbuds by the time you get done trying all the cheap one you could have had the galaxy buds if you have a galaxy phone and have wasted enough money like I have go ahead and get them they are worth every penny
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-06,"if your primary use is for phone calls with apple devices, you may need to keep looking.","Summary
For phone call using apple devices…
PROS: great noise isolating, immersive, stereo++ earbud audio experience good options with apps for tuning ambient noise in or out. great audio quality for inbound / outbound call audio, but there is currently zero opportunity to tune it. good equalizer controls with the app. They’ll look good in your ears, too. CON: very poor integration with apple devices. for phone calls. you'll need your device on hand for basic call controls.. don't ,make the mistake of not having your device nearby for important phone calls; you won't have the control you need without it. Brief
there is minimal integration for these earbuds making phone calls with apple devices. All you have is Bluetooth inbound / outbound audio, and audio ""Hey Siri call <contact x>"". That seems to work. Once everything is connected and working, you’ll quickly discover all the things you can't control thru these earbuds. At least not yet. You can’t answer a call. You can’t hang up a call. You can’t put your phone on mute. You can’t increase decrease phone call audio volume(s). for these controls you need your apple device. You have *very little control* of anything on your call, or off, thru these earbuds, for your apple device. samsung's best tech support staff admits to this
the outbound audio mic sound quality is probably the best i've experienced with these earbuds. The earbuds do work for phone calls hearing inbound audio clearly / being heard extraordinarily well. I believe the device HW has three separate mics, and via nifty SW triangulates between them detects, filters, and transmits only what you say over your calls. This does seem to work extraordinarily well. But, again, there is no way to tune or adjust settings even for this, not even with any of Samsung apple app’s currently available. So technically speaking, there is a hands-free capability. With these earbuds you can put your phone down and use your hands for something else. Your audio call quality will likely be as good as you’ve experienced with any Bluetooth earbuds, or better. That is, up until you need to issue any basic command to your phone. Then you need your apple device(s). There’s minimal capacity for voice control. You can get your device's attention with ""Hey Sir..."" via the earbuds. when they're connected..
i Install steps. 1. Download and install Samsung’s app from the Apple App Store (e.g. for iPhone devices, the “Samsung Galaxy Buds+” app is what you need). ***don’t use this app to connect the earbuds. *** Use Apple’s Bluetooth settings as described in the next step. 2. Use your apple device to connect (e.g., use your apple device settings -> Bluetooth to connect; my earbud’s device name is “Galaxy Buds+ (F24F)”)
Conclusion
I will probably return these and get the Apple AirPods Pro instead. I'm saddened b/c these Samsung earbuds seen like another top-notch product from Samsung. It does appear Samsung implemented the phone call functionality only as an afterthought. With the Apple AirPods Pro I know I’ll pay more, and I’ll need to tolerate slightly less quality with call audio. but at least I can expect better earbud integration with my device. And I’ll look goofier too with something sticking out of each ear."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-06,pretty much same as originals,p much no difference in sound but longer battery life
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-06,as good as most of my trucker headsets for calls,i am so happy i upgraded to the new version from the regular buds. the battery life is nice and i use them all day every day one ear at a time. however that is not a reason to upgrade nor is the possible sound upgrade. the only reason to do it is if you want to use it for calls. the older version is all but the same thing other then this. i could not use it for calls at all. no one could hear me at all. it was useless for calls and very much a pain in the ass. the new version works perfectly as a call head set and gets about 2 hours more play time. side note that it will completely kill the battery if you use ambient sound. like 1/3 the total life even on low setting. it is amazing. i can put the other head sets away. be ready for the fingerprints on the stupidly shiny plastic. GET A SKIN OR CASE. the cases from the older buds should fit the new.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-06,I try them alll.... this are the best.from apple to beats. Samsung you did it!,AMAZING!!!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-06,Small upgrades make a world of difference,"I use the original Galaxy buds. I'm glad to see Samsung the best of times and revamping their software adding a couple of features. Waterproof, and the ability to control ambient sound around you is nice (as is the software suite they updated on their handsets through the Wear app). The wireless charging is fast and convenient, and the fact they added an enormous amount of battery life maybe these an easy choice for me. I wish they offered a couple more colors, but I could say the same about the s20 line as a whole. They stay in my ear when I exercise, and are are comfortable while I'm laying in bed if I don't want to keep the wife awake. if you have never owned a pair I would recommend these over any of the Apple rivals. There are still cheaper alternatives on Amazon that offer fairly similar sound, but if you're fully immersed in a Samsung ecosystem there's no going wrong here."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-07,Happy with my purchase,I will start off by saying there are better wireless buds for the money. However I am very happy with these. They look very nice and don't protrude from your ears like some others. The battery life is pretty good and more than enough to last me a few days before having to charge again. The sound quality isn't gonna blow you away but comparatively its decent and the ambient noise feature is nice to have. Lastly the fit of these takes a little bit to figure out whats comfortable but once you find it they stay in pretty well and if they weren't blasting noise in my ears I'd forget they're there.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-07,Quality of sound js good,Use for gym!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-07,Better than I thought.,"I'm happy with this purchase, the jabra elite 75t I had disconnect issues. The sound quality is really good, but the call quality is even better. Can't say enough good this about this buds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-07,"Can't use ""Find"" feature without granting literally every permission available on your phone","The ""Find"" feature is simple. All it has to do is beep the earbuds so you can find them. But that's hidden inside the Galaxy Wearable app.
In order to beep your earbuds, you have to grant it access to *always on* location, storage on your device, your calendar, call logs, your contacts, the ability to make phone calls, and to send SMS messages. I also had to give it permission to INSTALL APPS on my phone, but since I couldn't find a way to take it back in settings, I assume it went to some Samsung system app somewhere, who knows where. I didn't want to give it these things so I said deny. You know what the app does when you press deny? It just crashes. No graceful handling, they will not let you use the app unless they get your data. I was desperate to find the earbuds, so I said whatever, and pressed OK to the mind numbing number of permissions dialogs. But that's not enough, it STILL won't let you beep your headphones unless you agree to the global Samsung privacy policy. Allow me to paste one small part of what you'e agreeing to:
*Sale of Personal Information*
We may allow certain third parties (such as advertising partners) to collect your personal information. So I gave up at this point, I had no idea it was even possible that buying earbuds could turn into a privacy nightmare, but Samsung made it possible. I just wanted to make the headphones beep, but I'll find them myself instead and return them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-07,Finally Samsung nailed it,"They finally got it. The buds that came out last year fell short. I had to return them, i could not have a conversation with someone without them complaining about me sounding far away. I work long hours in a noisy environment. That problem has been FIXED. I can wear them all day at work, 12 to 14hrs. The buds plus are comfortable enough and the conversation quality is great. I have had no complaints. The soud of music could be better but that is not the purpose of me having them. I am also comparing them to the sanhizer and klipsch that i had. The best part for me is the fact that i can make calls from each bud independently. And the transparency mode is pretty good as well, definitely an improvementover the buds. I am happy to finally have something that can handle a loud work environment."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-07,Burning charging,I love these headphones overall.. the one down side I have is that when I wirelessly charge the headphones they get crazy hot and feel like they are going to burn me. Besides that they are perfect
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-07,Amazing,"Battery life is off the charts, Sound quality is pretty good and the app is awesome! Switched from the bose true wireless and I dont regret it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-08,Great buy,Excellent wireless earbuds!!! Very satisfied
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-08,"Good quality, weird ambient noise cancellation","Pros:
- sound quality is very good; deep bass with sharp vocal and treble
- battery life seems to be very good, although I have not used the whole battery life since I bought my earbuds last week. Cons:
- Ambient noise cancellation is weird especially when you put it in low cancellation mode. It creates weird noises, especially in quieter indoor places. - The maximum volume is not ever super powerful. I compare it with Bose QC35 II. Although there seem to be some improvements needed by Samsung, I'm happy with them as a workout earbuds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-08,Buds 2 are top notch.,Best fit. Best sound. Best sound canceling.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-08,"Great sound, great battery life, and comfort","The sound quality is very good. Good bass, and treble. The mids can lack with certain genres, but still good. Some might be better, but not without spending twice as much. The ambient sound detection is a very nice feature. These are the most comfortable earbuds I've tried. With the different sized tips and wing tips, you can get a perfect, snug fit. They don't come loose under any circumstances I've encountered. Combined with a Samsung phone, it's a seamless product. Even though the charging case doesn't hold a ton of recharges, 11 hours on a single charge more than makes up for it. Even if you don't have a Samsung phone, the play store app is great for controlling these."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-08,Discreet and unique. More importantly great sound quality,Pretty good sound quality and features that are great to have. Not sure if there is a volume thing on the headphones still learning them but super happy with this purchase
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-08,I like,They are working great just hard to get out of case for me and I wish there was a way to hang them around my next
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-08,Buy these...don't bother with the competition!,"These earbuds have changed the game! They paired with my phone and the Samsung Wear app with no issues. The sound is crisp and clear and with super high ambient mode you can enjoy your music and still be aware of your surroundings. The touchpads are customizable and yes you can pair with 2 different devices...simply open the Samsung Wear app on the device you want to pair with and just like that they are in sync with it. The battery life is second to none. I listened to music for 6 to 7 hours and they still had 20% left. I really can't picture paying $100 more for Airpods and them being worth doing so. Call quality is great and they don't hurt your ears with extended wear. If you're in the market, these are it!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-08,Great quality,Beat ear buds you can buy.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-08,Not Bad,"I think these buds are pretty cool. I'm able to leave one in my ear all day and listen to music/podcast while I'm at work. They get a little uncomfortable for me after a while though. There is a little rubber flange on the buds that help hold them in your ear, after a while it starts to hurt. I also wish that these got louder. I'm not sure if there is an issue or not. I have these paired up with an S10 +."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-09,Best one so far,Worth the money
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-09,Not compatible with Windows PC,"These earbuds are purposefully made for Samsung products. It so happens they worked well with my Google Pixel Phone. The sound is very crisp, on point. I like a lot of bass. For my liking, these earbuds don't make the cut, but the sound is so clear, I would have kept them. Call quality might just be the best in the business. The case feels flimsy. Most disappointing is, a Samsung Galaxy Support agent told me clearly they are not compatible with PCs. There is a clear lag between sound/image and sound in the earbuds. Very disappointed. I can't believe someone would pay so much to have earbuds work only (exclusively!) with one device."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-09,Great and reliable,"Out of all the wireless sound buds I've purchased over the last few years, this is by far the best. I travel a lot and the sound is great and the case is small enough to fit into my pocket with ease."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-09,WOW! Best upgrade ever,"I was perfectly happy with my original Galaxy Buds. For about a year they were my faithful companions, which is why when Samsung introduced the Galaxy Buds+ I was originally thinking I would pass. I watched a few reviews on YouTube and my ears started to perk up. Last week I decided to buy them and WOW! what a difference they make. Call quality, in even the most challenging environments is significantly improved. This alone is worth the upgrade, in my opinion. Then there is the huge improvement in sound quality and on battery life, 11 hours vs 6 in the regular buds. I highly recommend the Galaxy Buds+. Get them, you will be glad you did."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,"Great sound, ambient mode is great at work and the find earbuds mode is a lifesaver!! 👍","First of all it's a Samsung. You can't go wrong with any of their products. Sound is amazing!! Especially when it's on the dynamic mode. With dual drivers in each earbud, everything is crisp and clear. The biggest seller for me was the ambient sound mode. With this you can listen to music and still hear people around you . This works well especially if you're at work. They have a low, medium and high setting just in case it's too much. And today.....as I got out of the car to walk towards my house I accidentally dropped one of the earbuds, that was laying in my lap in the car, on the ground when I got out. Of course I panicked thinking I'd never find it and probably misplaced it at work thinking it's lost for good now. Then I remembered that on the Galaxy wearable app there's a way to find a lost earbud by tapping find my earbud. When you tap it and if it's close by, you'll hear a loud chirping sound. Thankfully I found it on my front lawn. If it wasn't for that feature I would have been SOL big time. Another big reason I'm satisfied with this product. 👍😁😎"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,"Sound is okey, Mic is very good",The sound is not loud enough but the mic totally worth it! Had no problem withe the battery
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,Best earbud ever,Loved it the vest earbud i ever used. So worth it for the price and the battery life is amazing lasting me the whole work hours using just one side. Shipping though is horrible because no weaps to protect my expensive package. Just a small box inside a big box moving freely when beejng toss around.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,Excellent quality,These are EXCELLENT!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,"Excellent battery life, great sound, decent mic","The battery life has been great with these. 11 hours per charge, with the case allegedly holding one additional charge for a total of 22 hours of battery. For the price these are amazing, with good sound and good noise isolation. These do NOT have active noise cancellation. That's not a big deal for me personally, but if that's important to you these are not going to work out. They fit securely, and the microphone sounds great as well."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-10,Not as good as expected,"Not the best earbuds I've used. Sound is a little weak, battery doesn't last as long as advertise."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-10,Its nice,Overall it's good but your ear might start to hurt if you wear it for long periods of time
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,Battery life for days,"This was an upgrade from the previous version of the Galaxy Buds. As far as looks are concerned, the charging case has a glossy finish this time around rather than the matte look on the previous case. This time around, the battery life is definitely improved from a 6 hour life to an 11 hour. The quality and feel of the tips and buds however are the same but with an added microphone on each to improve on ambient sound. For an extra $20 USD, I think these are a decent upgrade but no need if you still have the standard."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,AirPod killer!,AirPod killer! This sounds much better than AirPods Pro! Much more comfortable. They do not work perfectly with an iPhone but they work well enough for me! The high end is pristine compared to the muddied upper registers on the AirPods Pros.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-10,Exceeded expectations,"Buying these headphones was not a decision that I took lightly. after reviewing the pros and cons and watching several review videos on YouTube I decided to purchase these instead of buying the original Samsung Galaxy buds based on the improved call quality with extra microphones, better sound quality because of two different drivers in each earbud to handle dynamic and balanced sounds, and better battery life. Only had them for a week but great so far"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-11,Best buds,Love these buds + last all day at work and some comfortable and easy to pair almost 100% hand free
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-11,Amazing!,These earbuds are beast. i suggested them to anyone that wants good battery life and real noise cancelling.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-11,Perfect fit Note 8,My husband likes it so much. It fits his note 8 phone very well.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-11,"Quality Product, great sound and connectivity","Have now had the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus a few days and I will say for sure that they are an awesome product and don't regret buying them. Not much you can find wrong with these what so ever. Able to use either bud separate of each other
Pros:
Bluetooth range is good
Call sound quality is very good
Video/music streaming has no sync issues
Awesome batter life
Nice charging case
Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time
Plenty of extra winglets and ear pads
Pairs super easy
Neutral:
Charging case is a tad small, but not too bad
Touch controls are very sensitive and odd to get use to
Only one extra charge in the case
Cons:
Need the Galaxy Wear app to get all benefits
No dual connection
Cannot control volume through the buds. Must use your device
Way better than the Bose Free SoundSport (Good Product) for a lot less money. You almost don't realize they are in your ear and can ear them. No issues with anyone I have called not being able to hear me. This is a product I can highly recommend"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-11,Almost fantastic,"Sound Quality:
These tws iems provide a very relatively neutral sound for a consumer-focused product. Everything sounds present, Subbass-bass-mids-highs. Nothing really overpowers each other. If you are someone who listens to many genres or likes to explore music, these are a solid choice. With the EQ presets you can 'slightly' adjust the sound to better suit the genre - I wish they just implemented custom eq, they already have it in sound assist...
I would say where these can fall short is when there is a bad connection between these and their transceiver. If the connection is stable, but 'bad' the highs start to artifact really badly. For my Samsung Note 9, this usually only happens for the first minute of pairing, but eventually ramp up to A+ quality and low latency - most likely because of the Samsung Scalable Codec. My computer, however, if I get a bad connection it stay there until I try repairing it a couple of times - I don't like installing drivers as much as the next person, but I mean why hamper the experience + they sell laptops too. Other Features:
Hear-through: My jaw dropped the first time I put them in, its really just crazy to know you are listening to iems, but can still hear the world around you. It almost feels/sounds like you aren't wearing anything, but somehow still getting music pumped into your head. It also helps with the cabin air pressure feeling I get from just wearing closed headphones/iems. It falls short in busier sounding environments though. If there is 'loud' chatter going on in the background, I can't really hear the person in front of me too well. That said I only ever kept them on the middle setting, never bothered with the super-hearing mode. Fit and Comfort: With 3 sets of wings and tips, I was able to find a good fit for both my ears. Where with other iems I would have to learn to seat each monitor differently to fit my ear, the guides really aid in positioning the monitor very easily into your ear. Touch controls: Didn't always work as intended. Sometimes I would want to turn on hear-through but it would just register as a single click or if I was adjusting the monitor it my ear it would also register as a click. The corner double-tap rarely worked for me. Maybe 1/10 attempts it would work. Some people said that kinda flapping the back of their ears with would press the button more accurately for them, but unfortunately my ears are too small and my fingers too sausage-y to get it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,Airpod Killers,"I finally found a good earbud solution that beats Airpods for anyone who doesn't either like the fit of Airpods or doesn't have an iPhone and Mac (like me). Pros:
Works with both iPhones and Android
Touch pads on both buds have awesome customizable functionality
The ability to use these with Windows, iPhone, and Android
Sound quality is the best I have found at this price point (I have tested the previous Galaxy Buds, Airpods, JLabs, and now the Galaxy Buds+)
Nice color selection
Great companion app that lets you customize the touch controls on Android and iOS - these customized controls also work on Windows (I don't have a Mac to test with)
Battery life is insane - 11 hours for the Buds and 11 hours for the charging case = 22 hours of battery life, a 3 minute charge from the case lasts an hour
Cons:
A little heavier than Airpods
Cost is $20 more than when the original Galaxy Buds were released"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-12,"Excellent Battery and Sound, a step back otherwise.","I assumed that BUDS+ would indicate BUDS plus more. WRONG! The health coaching in the earbuds is gone, as well as being able to upload songs to the buds for playback. These are just bluetooth earbuds with all the great features of the 2018 version removed."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-12,"Great sound, needs deeper tip option","These have excellent full range sound quality with good detail. Unfortunately the tips supplied don't go deep enough into my ear canal to get a tight sound leak proof fit. I have to fight with them every time to get them in a good enough position accidentally triggering the touch controls in the process. The depth of the earpiece is part of the problem. I have used wired buds in the past and due to their slim nature, there is no impediment to get a good sound seal with a similar tip size. I am looking for replacement tips that offer a bit more flexibility in getting a good tight fit. Disappointed for 150 buds that there were not more ear tip options included. The wing tips don't offer anything useful for my situation."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,These rock.,"I love it, and the range is impressive. I guess the sound could be a tad better, but I think it may be the rubber tips which one could replace. Fit is also amazing."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,THESE THINGS DON'T MOVE +Black Magic,"I was head banging to some music like a violent crackhead, and these little black beauties didn't budge an inch. Not only that, but they have some crazy black magic that lets me hear my surroundings even if I'm rocking out to some loud tunes. The sound is so good, it's like I Rick Moranis'd Blink 182 and put them directly into my ear canal. I turned these bad boys up to 11 and didn't look back."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-12,I really wanted to like these,"I'm obviously in the minority when it comes to these ear buds, when I say that the sound quality of the buds for listening to music is not really that great. There are others who are really liking the sound quality, which pushed me to second guess myself. My first response was ""why does the drummer sound like he's banging on cardboard boxes?"". I googled the different ways of getting these buds to sound better than when I first put them in my ears. And, they did start to sound better. Tweaking the Equalizer, putting the Samsung Wearables on ""Dynamic"", and what really helped was going with the larger earpiece. But, none of these came close to the Anker blue tooth earbuds that I was trying to replace. One thing I got from this experience, is that spending a bunch of money does not guarantee better quality."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,Incremental upgrade from the original.,Owned the original Galaxy Buds and AirPods. These are only a slight sound upgrade from the previous Galaxy Buds. They are considerably lighter and the battery life is significantly longer. The bigest difference from the original is the call quality. The caller won't be able to tell the difference in you having the phone to your ear. Compared to the AirPods they're more comfortable and sound better. You really can't compare these to AirPod Pros because they are in a different proce category.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-13,Good for what it is!,"If you're looking for all day usage, great call quality and overall good connection reliability, this should be at the top of your list. If you are critical and want your music to be as transparent, clear and immersive, bluetooth will not take you there. You need a good DAC and a decent pair of iem's for that. Having owned the original and now the plus, it is a good enough upgrade to justify the price. I will not go into the features but it is implemented properly and Samsung seems to have worked out all the glitches. Bluetooth has it limitations and while it has been getting progressively better, it could never replace a good pair of headphones. This technology is a couple years old and I think it's about time some engineers come up with something else that would enable us the bandwidth to stream without degradation/ compression. You can enable Dolby Atmos, change EQ settings, apply effects and all the bells and whistles that come with the application, it will never bring out what is already lost. I have done tons of comparisons with wired alternatives to see if it's even close enough and I'm left disappointed every time. I'm spending too much money on these things with every iteration thinking it will get close enough so I'm taking a backseat until some other tech for audio transmission is developed. With sound quality out of the way, everything else about the product is great."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-13,The buds to get,"These are definitely worth the price. Replaced my airpods 2 with these and definitely there's a difference. The Mic quality is exactly the same same as in airpods gen 2. Battery life is something else, you can wear these all day long and not need to charge them. The buds do get loud. Very comfortable and don't fall out when training."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-13,They're great!,"I've had these for a few days and, I have to confess, I didn't like them at first. Due to a lack of documentation which would have provided helpful information on how the ""wings"" and ""tips"" work, it took me quite a few tries to find a combination that works for me. However, after that, I've very pleased. FYI, i had to use the ""wings"" that are basically flat with a large tip in my right ear and a medium tip in my left."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-13,Good sound and great battery life!,"These true wireless galaxy buds + sound really good and have amazing battery life. My only knock would be that buds don't power off when removed and it's nearly impossible to reposition or remove one without changing tracks or pausing your song due to the touch sensitive side panels. Not a deal breaker by any means. Also wish it could go just a little louder. They get loud don't get me wrong,but I always try to go just a little higher and I am already maxed out. I'm being picky only due to the price. They work flawlessly and I've had zero problems. I highly recommend. I am using with a Note 9."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-13,Only worth it if you have a Samsung phone.,"Is it really worth 150? Only if you are using a Samsung phone. It gets the job done and is all around for everyday use. Not much to say about it. Portable and good for all situations. The case is glossy so it is prone to scratches. I have one fat scratch on the case. No big deal though. If you have the original, don't bother to upgrade. There is only a significant difference."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-13,Worth the price tag,These are great way better than the alternatives. Work flawlessly and the battery lasts for so long it’s nuts. Also active listening is a game changer for me at work.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-14,Garbage battery life,"My galaxy buds ""plus"" gets barley 7.5 hours of playtime before I have to charge so their 11 hours is all lies I'd settle for the first gen they're cheaper with the same battery life"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-14,Over 12 hours of battery,"Battery lasts over 12 hours from full charge
Fit good
Best earbuds I ever bought"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-14,Best true wireless buds I've used.,"Best wireless buds I've tried. Ambient sound, battery life, call quality, you get no background noise because the fit is so good in ear. I use these while driving for hands free, and they're completely safe because I can hear everything around me. The music sounds so good I prefer it over the car Bluetooth. I ordered a yellow case and wireless fast charger through Amazon as well. The charger has the phone stand and the side plate for the Buds+ to charge. Both can be used separately or as one unit. In regards to the yellow case, I got that because Samsung used a gloss finish and I didn't want to scratch that up. The case works by having a small double sided tape on top, but I found it wasn't thick enough to stay stuck to the case on top so I added a second one (they included 2 extra) and it's perfect. Battery life is amazing, I use these daily and only charge my case every few days. I haven't run out of battery yet. Call quality is great, people can hear me better using the Buds+. The original Buds were pretty bad for calls. Overall these are a major improvement. The touch controls are extremely responsive. I love that I can customize the long press on each ear, I have ambient sound on/off in the left, and Google Assistant on my Note 10 on the right. The volume up/down on the outer edge is tricky at first, but you get the hang of it quickly. I love these, and would absolutely recommend them if you're thinking of upgrading to the plus model or just looking fit wireless buds in general."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-14,Long battery life!,Lasts my entire 8.5 hour shift and sounds great. It's secure in my ear when I gently push and twist the bud in my ear. I wish there l were bigger rings for the outter ear though.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-15,Happy I bought the8,The call quality is fantastic
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-15,Does not work in Skype for business,"These earbuds are amazing. They are super comfortable and just stay in the ear. Sound quality is great. Be forewarned that they do not work in skype for business calls, which was why I bought them and the reason for a 3 star review. After 15 minutes into a Skype call, the mic stops functioning and you can no longer be heard. I have posted in the Samsung community and no resolution."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-15,Awesome battery live,The sound quality and battery is amazing I just don’t like the ambience sound I think is not yet there they are going in the right direction for sure but it just sounds to much pressure on your ear it’s not comfortable for long hours
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-15,Great Purchase,Best bang for your buck.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-16,"Easy to use, charge, and store","I love the ease of access, the fit in the ear. The ease of operations, the small size of the case, and it's ability to stay in the ear. The charging feature of the case is out standings. These are perfect for me."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-16,These headphones are the truth!,"Really sound quality, noise cancelation, and battery life 5 out of 5!! !"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-16,Best battery ever for earbuds!,"Ok this is an upgrade for me from the SM-r170. This is superior in the one place I wanted the most, that is the battery life! I started at 6am and didn't take them out at all except a half hour break till 4:15pm. The right earbud still had 29% and the left had more. All other features seem pretty much the same. The Wearable app does now show the cases battery level as well which is a great improvement. The case feels and looks sturdier and more attractive with a heavier shinier appearance and better left right indicator inside. The ambient sound function is noticeably improved! I was able to leave them in during an entire conversation with my boss today no problems at all hearing him. As a matter of fact unlike the older model I couldn't even tell I was hearing the sound being converted to digital and back to my ear again other than a mild background hiss, but that was expected considering heavy equipment was running around us. This is absolutely the best ever earbuds! The wings on the shape are superb allowing me to twist them in behind a fold in my ear which allows them to lock in place. They never fall out!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-16,If you like high volume these are not for you,"I love the fit and in app features, but the volume is way too low"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-17,Just not as good as airpods,"I really wanted to love these I really did but..I just don't. I'll start with the good:
Battery life is absolutely amazing. They can be connected, playing music, talking on the phone, etc. for hours - and still have 70% battery. Sound is very good IF you have them securly in/using the right size configuration. And now to the bad:
Remember that amazing battery that in theory could provide all day listening? Good luck wearing them more than 3-4 hours, seriously I tried my hardest to get used to them along with multiple size configurations and simply couldnt get past the comfort. If they're at all loose the sound is horrendeous. Use your laptop/pc with bluetooth? All I can say is good luck, these constantly drop and even when they're connected the sound is extremely tinny? And yes I tried updating all my drivers with no success. My biggest gripe is the fit, which could be just a personal issue. Also if you dont listen to music for a long period of time every day these should be great for you (assuming you also arent using a computer). I'm a happy Andriod user, but sadly I'll be switching back to the old airpods."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-17,Too many issues,"Music speed changes when my screen goes on or off (using the Galaxy S10+ no less)
Left earbud had connection issues. Case battery drains while not in use. I returned mine."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,0,2020-03-18,"Good Casual Use, Bad Athletic Use","There's a reason I found it by the Galaxy phones and not in the fitness earphone aisles. Pros:
Very comfy and light, meaning almost no bounce when running or bouncing. The fit in the ears is great, and that's coming from a guy with cauliflower ear. I often have problems with buds staying in my left ear. Very aesthetically pleasing. Very responsive touch button. The requested actually happens quicker than other buds of this price range. The ambient noise feature is great and almost natural. It's nice being able to have a conversation with my wife with both buds in. You can connect to multiple devices, no problem. Three mics for good call sound and noise cancellation. Cons:
Terrible water resistance and should not be worn in the rain. Sound is balanced, but isn't as full as other alternatives. Choppy Bluetooth connection through the body if phone is behind you (i.e. in your pocket). The choppiness went away with the phone in my hand. I feel like the choppiness was reduced if I turned off ambient noise, which I don't want to have to do. Wind through the ambient noise feature sounds terrible and messes with music experience outside. It sounds similar to the way wind sounds are captured on an old camera recorder. App doesn't have as much functionality as alternative product apps (very limited equalizer selection that doesn't change the experience much). It doesn't help that I'm used to the app for Soundcore with their amazing equalizer options. Summary: Good for casual wear which is primarily in doors. Bad for active use like running, except for their fit. Great for phone calls, but just a little subpar for a good music experience, especially if you like bass."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-18,"Great sound, battery life and features","I'm a huge samsung guy. I have a samsung phone, samsung laptop, samsung tv. The brand has never failed me. These headphones are really good. Sound is great. Nice features. Price is a little high then what I'm used to paying for other headphones but I guess its becuase it name brand and really isent far off from similar name brand earbuds. The ambient sound feature is nice as well but I noticed when I turned that on when I run I hear lots of wind that the microphone catches. So I had to turn it off then it was fine. After I was done I turned it back on and it was kinda cool I dident have to take off my earbuds to talk to people. The samsung wear app let's you change alot more settings then I'm used to so that's a convient feature. The battery is a great bonus to. 11 hour off one charge and 11 more with the carrying case. Bottom line I'm very happy with them. Great sound, battery life and the look and feel are great!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-18,Battery is crap,Would be perfect if the battery on the case wasn't always draining when the charge on the earbuds is already at 100%
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,Great product,Great for music and phone calls
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-19,Not thrilled,"The sound is very tinny, base is practically non existent. Also the sound is definitely weaker out of the left earbud even after trying all possible earpiece combinations which is very annoying and makes me wonder if they sell returned/faulty products as new hoping the buyer would rather just keep them than go through the warranty or return process."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,Good quality great with Note10+5g,"I expected them to be ""loud"" however they aren't loud per say but when volume is maxed you hear nothing else which is good. Pretty comfortable battery life is good easy connection and on screen display when connecting"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,Light weight and comfortable. Good sound quality.,"They're so light and comfortable that sometimes I totally forget that they're still on me. Sound quality is somewhat balanced (in Dynamic Mode). Noise cancellation isn't the best, but for a pair of earphones with no ANC... they'll surely surprise you. Battery life is impressive for their size. For about 1-2 hours of music playback a day they last for almost two weeks. ALMOST! !"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,The perfect pair of true wireless earbuds!,"An unbelievable generational jump that isn't getting enough credit for how spectacular it is. The Buds+ are the purchase I've been waiting near a decade to make. Flawless connection, amazing sound quality, and all day battery. As a factory worker, these were a revolutionary jump in quality of life at work. Can not recommend highly enough!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,I'm impressed!,"Never been much of an earbud person let alone saw myself spending this kind of money on something that seemed trendy more than anything. The ambient passthrough is what really sold me. I work in manufacturing so it's important that I'm able to hear my surroundings. All I have to say is WOW. Call quality is amazing, battery life is good, and I'm 100% sold on these! No regrets! If you're debating these because of the price, don't. They're worth every penny!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,The best wireless Earbuds out there.,"I can honestly say I love these. The previous version was good, but these are 100x better. I will never go back to any other wireless Earbuds. I never leave the house without them. Thank you so much."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,Best i have had,Best earbuds I've ever had. When you switched from my iPhone 11 pro max to the Samsung S 20 Ultra i still held on to my airpods while they worked i had no control of them so I switched to these glad I did not using my aipods anymore
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,Love it,Perfect
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-20,Not a big fan of the sound quality,"For what it's worth, it does have amazing battering life. The noise cancellation is not terrible, however, if you want earbuds with THE crispest sound quality, this isn't it. The bass boost sounds very artificial. If you don't really care that much for rich sound quality, these are definitely the best bang for your buck."

Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Great buy,"They're great at music. If you play around with the settings you can get some great bass out of them. Music is great on both Android and iPhone. On iPhone weirdly, both pieces of the headset show up individually when you try to pair. The call quality is great and people can hear me just fine. On iPhone you must have both headphones set to connect in the blue tooth section for them to work. Apple make everything complicated. Lastly the touch feature is weird to use but after some practice it almost feel natural. I wish you could customize the touch settings further than just the one touch and hold setting. Beside that this is worth the purchase. Be mindful of how to wear them as it will hurt your ear off you don't wear them properly."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-21,Great for price,"Good sound
Great battery life
Can experience fatigue when worn fo a long time"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Good quality.,Much better than the regular Samsung earbuds.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Worth it.,"Totally worth it! Sound quality is amazing, and with the app on my Samsung Galaxy S8+, I can change the sound quality to my preference. The ambient sound feature works really well. Zero lag in calls, and the touch sensitivity on the outer portion of the earbuds works great. Lots of custom features made to fit the needs of the individual user."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,The microphones are much better!,Nice!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,What more could you even want,"I absolutely love these. My first gen ones were great save the battery life but these go all day at work, pop them in the case for the ride home and they can go all night at home. If they sound not great move up a size for the inner ear (I know it's not the inner ear) and I promise they will blow you away! Expensive yes but worth it also yes"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-21,"Disappointed, and returning","I was so excited to receive these. It is very hard to find excellent earbuds, especially from Samsung. I just received these yesterday and without going into a lot of detail, these really let me down. They are confusing, uncomfortable, and very expensive. In the first hour of using them, all my calls dropped. I did do the update which seemed to help, but I am not taking any chances. I feel like these buds are strictly for music, NOT phone conversations. I was also not happy with the ambient noise feature and tapping on the buds to skip song selections. It was very annoying. A light press would not work; I had to hard press to skip or pause a song, which only drives the earbud deeper into my ear canal (not comfortable at all). I cannot comment on the battery life as I am returning them right away. For close to $160, I think you can find better than these. I like the choices of audio (dynamic, clear, normal), but I don't feel these are worth the price. These fell out of my ear a few times and although I changed the earbud size (that comes in the box), they never felt right. I just could not get used to them, even after one full day. Returning, and going back to my AKG earbuds that offer amazing sound with less pain."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Great Ear Buds,Great for keeping them in and still able to gear around you. When you want to.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-21,Best earbuds,"The sound of these earbuds is crazy good, not only are they crystal clear but somehow the bass is phenomenal too! They also pair super easy with various Android phones I've tried and my windows laptop."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,They do the job and sound better then most earbuds in this price range,Much better than original buds for calls they even sound better than my wife's Airbuds pro
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Add to cart!,Love the battery life. 11 hour play time and another 11 hours from the case. Hell yea! I wish the Bass level was better but over all it's a great buy. Glad I waited for the plus to come out.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-22,Feels great sounds bad,I ordered these last week cause I wanted buds with active noise cancellation. They felt great right out of the box. Very comfortable and great battery life is about all that is good about these. However they sounded awful. Very tinny and low sound even after the firmware upgrade and messing with the lousy EQ. No matter how I tried the sound was just bad. Also when you touch them to adjust them sometimes it cuts out the music. Please save yourself the disappointment and buy the Jabra 75Ts.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-22,"Horrible, muddy sound","For $150 and being made by Samsung, I would've assumed the audio would be tolerable to say the least. These sound barely better than the Samsung buds I got with my S10 lmao. I never liked earbuds because the audio was always bad and fell out, but still. These don't fall out but the audio is not worth the $150 price tag. I'll stick to my headphones or eventually try a more expensive model from Sony/Sennheiser/etc."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-22,Sounds and easy to carry,I love these. Connects to my s20 great.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-22,Great quality ear buds!,"These are great ear buds. The battery life is superb, the sound quality excellent. I’m slightly disappointed with the bass, but other than that these are high quality, easy to set up and use. I use the iPhone version of the galaxy buds + app. Despite reading many reviews complaining that they couldn’t connect their buds to the app, I had no problem. If you’re going to use them frequently, I would say they are worth the money."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-22,Beats airpods,Way better then airpods gen 2.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-22,The husband loves it,My husband loves these buds. He uses them for work. He works in a small office with coworkers and the noise cancellation capability works WONDERFULLY. Hes able to speak and hear his clients in peace and without the distraction from his colleagues.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,0,2020-03-22,🤢🤮,"Man, Samsung, you could've added an 11 how battery life 2 years ago. I've got a pair of 20 dollar earbuds that are IPX7 and lasts 15 hours on a single charge that put these to shame, even in sound quality. 🙄
C- 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-22,Great value and incredible product. Definite improvement upon the first gen.,"Every single minor complaint I had with first gen Galaxy Buds was addressed with the Galaxy Buds+. Everything I wish the first gen had or did, these ones have it or do it. Much clearer ambient sound, like cant even tell you have headphones in. You can use ambient sound while on a call. A much better overall battery life. Clearer and better sound quality overall. Better setup with the Galaxy Gear app. Massively improved voice recognition for voice commands through headphones. I cannot say enough good things about these. The Galaxy Buds+ are without a doubt worth the extra $50 over the first gen Galaxy Buds. I recommend them 100%."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-22,so far so good,I bought these as u can link to iphone but it doesn’t show me how much battery life they have. I have to be guessing how long they will last but besides that they are okay.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-23,Quality product,"Exactly as advertised, extremely happy with these earbuds. Love the wearables app and all the personalization you can do. I wish there was more in the walkthrough when first using them, for example you can just tap your ear to increase/decrease volume which I found on Reddit. Great quality product and love the wireless charging of the case. Time will tell how long they last as this has been the case in the past with headphones not lasting long."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-23,These have amazing battery performance.,"These are the best experience I have had in blue tooth ear buds. Samsung makes a great product. I dont have a Samsung phone yet, but it works and connects very well with the phone I have."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,0,2020-03-23,Constant issues with left bud,"2 stars because I have been through 2 sets of buds in less than a year. First, the left bud started loosing volume till barely any sound came out of it. Sent it back to Samsung and what a process that was. They sent me a replacement - 5 stars for that. Second, the new pair did not last more than the first, about 4 months and the left bud stopped charging. Would I buy them again? Nope."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-24,Works great,"Editted: Had a software issue, phone was dimming audio because it thought it was casting hulu to the tv still, when it wasnt. So they're great. Lol also learned some tricks to make the volume loud af. Turn that Dolby atmos on! Had them for a few days and the volume drops about 40% after a few seconds of video/music. Tried all the support fixes and still does it. Sending them back. Had cheap 20$ buds before and didnt have this problem at all."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-24,Comfort and Convenience,"These are great. I wanted the convenience of long battery life in a TRUE wireless bud, and these deliver. They are VERY comfortable, at least for my ears. They're also held securely in place with a slim silhouette, and no protruding stems. They recharge FAST. As far as sound quality, they're not Sennheiser 600s, but for this design and price point, they might be as good as it gets. I just don't have a way to benchmark them against competitors. But the convenience and ease of use make these a great product for all day use any time you like."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-24,Fix the right ear bud please,"The right ear bud starts to muffle and starts to lower in sound over time. And the only way to fix the issue is to put the left ear bud inside the charger, but you need to leave it in there for a couple of minutes because if you take the left one out right away the right bud will get muffled again. Bought two new ones and they both had the same issue. Would recommend if this issue is fixed but for now its just infuriating"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-24,Buy it so worth it !,Got this for my bf and he absolutely loves them we’ve been struggling to find a pair that cancels out background noise when talking on the phone and these do the job !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-24,Come on Samsung!,"🤦🏾‍♂️ I desperately wanted to love these earbuds, after all they've gotten pretty stellar reviews. The case feels solid, has a nice snap whenever you close it, the synching is pretty easy. The buds themselves fit perfectly in my ear out of the box. The controls were simple and intuitive enough. The sound quality for music was good, no thumping bass, the vocals were pretty clean, changing the equalizer really didn't do too much of nothing. So what's wrong with these earbuds?.... The call volume is hideously low! The voices sound so tiny. I went to YouTube, Google, Samsung trouble shooting page and nothing! I don't know if I got a bad pair or not, most videos dealing with the issue focuses on music volume. No mention of call volume at all. I did a search in the Amazon Q&A and there appears to be one more guy who's having a similar issue, but there's no other smart answer other than the ever so unhelpful ""mines work fine dude."" I put in a order for a replacement and I'll update to let you fine people know what's happening."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-25,"Not bad, no bass even turned up...","Clarity is great, but if you're looking for something with more bass this isn't it. Battery life is great and with its price point a better deal than say the other brand."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-03-25,Poor Samsung support,"Like the fit and quality of sound. Tighter fitting eargel definitely increases bass. Haven’t had it long enough to say anything about battery life. Had to return it to Samsung (not Amazon) because case would not charge on Qi charger. I have yet to receive a replacement. It is now March 25. I sent it on the 1st of Mar. ,they received it on the 3rd. I have chatted with Samsung support twice and called once. All they can say is that the ticket is still open. No word on when I will receive my replacement or why it is taking so long. Very frustrating. One star for Samsung support."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-25,Great product that deserves a great review.,"These earbuds are amazing! Pros:
Sound quality
Call experience
Ambient sound
Connectivity
Battery life (3 minute charge gives 1 hour listening experience)
Cons:
The sound could be a tiny bit louder. But, I mostly took care of that with my phone settings. Trust me, this is very minor. I saw some reviews on how people were angry because they were not ""true"" noise cancelation earbuds. I work in the construction field and, when you turn ambient sound off you're not hearing much of anything. Also, my gym plays their music ungodly loud. So, when I turn these earbuds on I'm not hearing my outside surroundings. A positive note for not having ""true"" noise cancellation is that your battery life is 11 hours on a single charge. all together you get 22 hours with a second charge. This is Compared to apple's new earbuds that only last 5 hours on a single charge. Now, I like Apple and they make great products but, the Samsung earbuds are just flat out better. I hope this review helps."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-26,Trash,"Trying to get support for the volume issues is pulling teeth. Yes, I downloaded the galaxy wearable app. Yes, I've scoured countless support forums and reddit. My left earbud is half the volume as the right and unusable. I have a pair of wired headphones that were about 5/6 bucks that are vastly superior plugged into my brand new 4 day old s10"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-26,No big improvements over the original Bud,"Had the Galaxy Bud, decided to give this upgraded one a try. Nothing worthy of an upgrade really. Samsung brags about huge improvement in sound quality but I really didn't notice anything. Ok the battery has improved a little, but the original Bud already had a pretty good battery. Bass is still poor, which is understandable for an earbud. It looks a bit shinier and glossy compared to the original bud. I'm not sure if it's a keeper."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-26,This is GREAT,These are great! Much improved call quality (3 mics). Music sounds better too with an additional speaker. All day battery life. The noise cancelation is the best. ABSOLUTELY 5 STARS 🌟
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,Good,Good
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,Best buy ever,"Think about a great wearable for your phone, this is one. I can easily make calls and hear myself and the person clearly (you have a bunch of options to make de ambience sound better)
Also the sound for music it's pretty good too, and the fact that you can easily choose what to do with each side (like open spotify directly, etc) it's pretty great"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-27,No ear fatigue,Love this earbuds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,Perfect but...,Great earbuds and feel great in the ear! Sound better than AirPod pros but they don’t work as well with Apple iPhone. If I had a Samsung I would definitely recommend these!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-27,Might just be me,They made my ears bleed. ☹️
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,Definitely a buy!,I think for the price these are well with it!!! A lot better then AirPods!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-28,"Sound great, last all day.","I love this Galaxy Buds+. Great sound, great battery live, very comfortable. I can use either left or right one. Clear voice when on my phone calls. I had the Jabra Elite 65t, they were good and had a better rating when it comes to water resistance but overall I prefer the Galaxy Buds+."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-28,Pretty good buds,"The galaxy buds+ are really great, battery life is pretty good, sound quality is pretty good, wish they had active noise cancellation but they do a pretty good job at drowning out the outside noise. I also wish they were more water resistant, I tried using these at the gym but my sweat was messing around with the controls and pausing my music. Love the app easy to use. But other than those 2 complaints, they are pretty good."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-28,Good earbuds,This is my first pair of galaxy earbuds and they're pretty great I definitely love the sound quality They stay in my ear the only thing that it's weird it's when you're talking while listening to music because you can hear an echo of yourself but other than that great earbuds in for the price
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-28,Perfect,Fast free shipping...just as described....great sound...long life...
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-03-28,Faulty design - cannot handle wind conditions,"The design is faulty. With the slightest wind, the wind noise gets amplified to the point that anyone speaking to you cannot hear you and you cannot hear music well. This means if you run. Faster than a 9 min/mile, the wind will interfere with sound quality and it worsens incrementally. So disappointing"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-28,Really Nice Wireless Ear buds,"These are my first wireless ear buds and I really, really like them. The sound quality is great, but slightly less presence than the wired buds that came with my phone. Not bad by any means. They were very easy to set up. I pretty much opened the pod and my phone and tablet instantly found them. It's really easy to switch which device I want to use them on also which is so convenient. My absolute favorite feature of these is the ability to hear sounds around you if you turn on ambient sounds. There's no perceivable delay, and at the medium setting, I can hear almost as well as my regular hearing. It's nice to pause my music with one tap, and carry on a conversation without taking out a bud. Since these are my first wireless buds, I can't say that they're better than any others, but I do recommend them if you're looking for some."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-28,Great product.,Love ambient mode. Sound quality is great. Value perceived is greater than price paid. Dont have to worry about it falling down or recharging it all day long.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-28,Perfect,I wish I would have gotten these a long time ago. Perfect. Comfortable. Great sound!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,0,2020-03-29,Disappointing call quality,"I bought this product (not at Amazon though) because many reviews on Youtube reported on the excellent call quality. Although it is maybe better than average, it is still not satisfying to me. I bought and tested 12 bluetooth headsets (Soundbuds Slim, Taotronics, Philips, JBL, MPOW, Samsung, ANKER - unfortunately I can not upload a photo here) and surprisingly, the inexpensive MPOW S15 (not TWS) came out on top regarding call quality (noticeably too!). Even when listening to music the MPOW sounds better than the Buds Plus! Unfortunate, because I would truely like to have TWS earbuds with excellent call quality. The Galaxy Buds Plus is great in other respects, like small size, battery life and comfort. But regarding call quality I am disappointed. I have tested the noise cancellation too and that works fine. When calling next to a busy road the other party could hardly hear the traffic."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-29,Cannot connect to 2 devices simultaneously-DISAPPOINTING,"the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus could have had a 5-star rating however they will not connect to my phone and laptop simultaneously which is a deal-breaker for me. at the $150 price point, I expected better. It did not occur to me that duel connction would be an issue since my Jaybirds X3 connected right out of the box."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,A must buy....,Impeccable sound quality exuding from a comfortably fitting product. Worth all the bucks spent and more. My first Samsung Bud. Love it🙂👍
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-29,"Great buds, but the iOS app doesn't work","These buds are great. They are comfortable to wear if you get the right size ratio. The battery life is off the charts compared to the other earbuds on the market. During phone calls, the clarity is good on both ends. The 3 microphones really help with call quality. The app is ok for adjusting the noise cancellation feature and the preset EQ is comparable to most of the other EQ apps available. My only gripe is with the Galaxy Buds+ app for iOS. It isn't compatible even though they say it is. I'm running iOS13.4 on my iPod 7 Touch, and it won't load because of compatibility issues. I tried reaching out to Samsung, but they are absolutely no help. All in all, these are great earbuds, but if you want the benefits of the app for your iPod. It won't work."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,As expected,"So I am coming from jabra 65 to these. Big difference,
1. The fit, fit way better than the 65 jabra, these are lighter and more pushed in, makiing them more comfortable. 2. Sound, is great good bass good highs ,and calls sound awsome. I really like to use the ambient sound on for all day use and its perfect. 3. Battery, not sure how they did it but they last a long time. 4. The mono use, i can use either left or right side only... on my jabra it was only right side."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-29,Not a really great value,Returned.. Major problem with sweat gave me a beeping sound
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-30,Dont buy they suck,Dont buy. Sound quality low!!!! I returned them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-30,Absolutely Amazing Buds!!,Love these Buds. Call sounds quality is amazing. I am using them for work call which is all day from 7:30 to 5pm. Calls are clear on both ends and batteries last all day. Only downfall is they are not waterproof. Otherwise they are perfection.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-30,"Works great, sounds great","I was a little skeptical to but these due to some so so ratings. I can only say that I am glad I did. I bought some cheap knock offs prior to this. The sound quality was tinny and the bluetooth connectivity was bad. Not these. The sound is rich and powerful and the connectivity is great. The noise cancellation is good for what they are (they are not over the ear, which is the best) as well. I recommend them highly."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-31,The worst I've heard for music ever,"I use uncompressed files for music. The audio on this set is horrible. No bass and weak thin mids with the highest frequencies almost twice as loud. The volume has to be way up in the red to listen at average volume and starts distorting even at low volume. Using Poweramp app helped level the sound out by lowering the high frequencies as they start to hurt your eardrums very quickly. Any attempt to bring the bass or mids in caused instant distortion. They simply can only carry high frequencies and not any reasonable volume level. There is high levels of noise sometimes as if the volume level is up high but with low output from the audio track. I was severely disappointed and find the $5 drug store earphones much better for music though these have better treble. Through the noise,
high distortion and low levels, music is immediately unpleasant. The ambient noise feature works well but I was able to use an app for that on standard headphones anyway. I'm awaiting feedback from others regarding call experience when talking to me."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-31,Reliability,"Absolutely the best buds I've ever owned. Some think they are pricey, but you do get your moneys worth."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-31,Good product but....,"Great product but not very comfortable in my ear for long periods of time. Since I purchased these to use while exercising, that's a deal breaker for me."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-01,"Reliable connection, good battery life, sounds great.","I bought these ear buds because I needed buds that would reliably connect to my phone during long runs and stay connected. I had been previously using Bose Soundsport True Wireless Buds, but while they sounded great, they would stutter and disconnect randomly while I ran. It was incredibly frustrating. I ordered the Samsung buds because I figured they'd have a better connection with my Samsung phone. I have not been disappointed. They sound great, there is no stuttering or cutting in and out, and they remain connected the whole time I use them. I like the charging case. The battery life on these buds is completely adequate. I barely put a dent in the battery life even with my longest runs. These buds are comfortable in my ears and I have no fear of jostling them or of them falling out. I would absolutely recommend these ear buds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-01,Fantastic!,"After buying cheap earbuds that self destruct in 2 months , these are awesome! Great sound and 12 hours of music and podcasts on a single charge!! Small case!! I'll update later on!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-01,I found them clunky and hard to use,I was not sure that I was going to like earbuds that just hung on my ear and I didn't. I have been using Wireless earbuds that have a wire between the two earbuds and that works better for me. I did buy a strap so that I would not I have to have these stuck in my ear all the time and I could hang them over my neck like my earlier pairs . I found these to be clunky. Every time I had to move them in my ear I would do something to either change my phone or something. I did not find them easy to use at all. Compared to other earbuds they are probably great. I love my Samsung products but a stand-alone earbud girl I am not.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-01,It is so much better than the previous buds!,especially the sound quality is so good.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-01,Worth it!,These galaxy buds in red are a beautiful color! I love the sound! And they're very easy to connect. Haven't had a problem with them at all!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-01,Epic,Epic
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-02,Disappointed with the connectivity,The only issue I have with these is that it hurts if you have them for a while and when i would go run it would cut off and that's why i returned them when i would be walking normally they would cut off too I'm disappointed i really liked these
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-02,Great while it lasted,"after using twice, the right one barely works now..."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-02,"Decent earbuds, but the touchpad functionality ruins the experience","This is the first set of Bluetooth I've owned so I can't say how these stack up compared to other brands. These were pretty easy to configure out of the box as they were immediately recognized by my Samsung S10+. They integrate using the galaxy wearable app with mixed results. The app works well for customizing sound presets, but not so much in other aspects. Sound and voice quality is good, and I've been using these primarily for video conferencing for work. The one major complaint I have with these earbuds however pertains to the touchpad functionality. Essentially, you can gesture on the actual earbuds to do various things (skipping tracks, volume, etc.). However, there's a tap-and-hold gesture that will end the call, and this is where my problem lies - if I go to adjust my earbud in my ear while on a call, it's been frequently disconnecting my call which is VERY frustrating. In the galaxy wearable app, there's a setting to disable these gestures, but the setting doesn't seem to hold after I put my earbuds back in the charging case and take them out to join another call - or at a minimum it's spontaneously reactivating touchpad gestures. I have to be sure that this is turned off whenever I'm wearing my earbuds before joining a conference call. If the app just worked properly and I could confidently and permanently turn these gestures off, I'd rate this product at least 4 stars, but it doesn't so I won't."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-02,It's a pair ear buds.,It's very small but sleek.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-02,I love these!,"I use these all the time. The battery life is no joke - literally 11+ hours of audiobook/music. The case holds about 2 full charges so I charge my buds+ once a week. Call quality is good and the ambient sound feature works, but both are a bit ""tinny."" I'm a little bummed that these are not water and dust proof, but I am more than satisfied with this product. Also, i like how it doesn't look like I have little cigarettes sticking out of my ears."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-03,GREAT INVESTMENT 👍,I'm a cheapy when it comes to headphones. I purchased the raycon 55 which were serviceable but terrible bass. Then I got some knock off brand $30 cheap plastic actually decent sound but failed every where else. Did not want air pods because I just think they look silly with the book. And I was going to go with the original air buds but for $50 more it seem to make sense. What I can say these sound amazing! Balanced sound and bass great clarity. I wish call volumes little louder buts a knit pick. I purchased these actually because working from home amid covid I needed good teleconference ear buds. But now we use zoom so I use them to hear and cancel out background noises. When music is on they basically are noise cancelling. I have Samsung level over the ear blue tooth headphones as well and will put those against Bose. Great product!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-03,More volume. Are you too young?,I want to go def when I wear these and that didnt happen.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-03,"Dual drivers, mostly neutral accurate sound","Skip gen 1, get these. Dedicated driver delivers fast, deep, accurate bass. Highs come through with a nice sparkle, never shrill or hot. These are quite neutral in signature with a slight bump in low end and when using samsung scalable codec (samsung only devices) they sound amazing for $150. $150 for a wired version would be a great deal, but BT 5.0, spotify integration and a bunch of other bells & whistles make them a steal. Fantastically tuned. Not bad AKG, not bad Samsung. Keep at it!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-03,"Great sound quality, horrible connection quality","The sound quality is amazing. The connection quality is terrible. I bought these mainly for running, and even with my phone strapped to my upper arm, the sound is constantly cutting out. I have tried various bluetooth codecs, changing the audio quality priority to connection stability. Every possible trick I found online, to no avail. The features it has with my Galaxy S8 are awesome, but AKG/Samsung should be embarrassed by this product overall."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-03,Poor Customer Service and Product Support,There is an issue with my left ear bud. Something with a mic in the left one while in ambient mode. I've tried several times to contact customer service and have been lied to about tickets being opened for my issue. Very poor customer service with different people telling very different stories. I just want to get my issue fixed so that i can clearly hear people while on the phone as that is my main method of working during the current pandemic.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-03,DON'T GET THEM IF YOU'RE GONNA USE IT WITH A WIRELESS TRANSMITTER!!! they're ok for music and calls.,"So I mainly bought these for work to use on my walkie( I'm an undercover security guard and I don't like the wire hanging from my ear) My goal was to purchase a wireless transmitter, hook it up to the walkie and connect the Buds+ to the transmitter. So I did that, I bought a $20 transmitter and while at work within the first 5-10 minutes when people would talk on their walkies the Buds+ would distort their voices almost robotic/""bit-crushed"" like. The only way to stop it was to disconnect the buds and reconnect them. I ended up buying an Airfly transmitter which is like $45 and It still distorted the sound within minutes of being used. My coworker has the same transmitter but the only difference is that he uses the first gen Apple Airpods and he doesn't get that distortion as I do. I've reset the Buds+ and it still happened, I used my girlfriend's Buds+ which I bought with mine and it does it as well. I ended up trying my Bose Soundsports and the noise was gone, only issue is that these earbuds are too bulky and have a wire attached to each bud. I contacted Samsung and all they told me was to contact the company and let them know about the issue. I'm hoping it can be fixed when the next update kicks in."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,happy kids,I bought three of them for my kids. They love it
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,Worth every bit!! Love them!,Love them! Was worried they would be uncomfortable but they are very comfortable and music sounds amazing. Easy charge & easy pairing. So worth the money!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-04,Great find,"These have been great so far. A friend recommended them and I have been impressed. I use them for both my Android and iPhone, and they works well on both."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,Perfect,"Its perfect, the best earbuds that I buy in my life after beats of course. But grate sound, grate quality and confort."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,Work great,"Bought for my gf she loves them, far better than any other she had before"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-05,"Nice sound, weak connection","Nice sound, works well for phone calls and battery lasts a good while, nice listening to music while I work.... but I'm really disappointed that it gets connection issues (static/breaks up) when my phone is in my pocket and I sit down. Really expected better...."

Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-05,Great headphones!,"They work as advertised! Great headphones, well built. I'd recommend them to anyone in the market for headphones."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,0,2020-04-05,Great but there's and flaw,"Great headphones, the only problem is they go out whenever I'm on a call and an earbud falls out of my ear and I reinsert it back in. They connection is also choppy Everytime something covers my phone."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-05,No good for physical activity...,"These work we'll while I'm in the office working (not moving around much), but the moment I go outside to jog or any physical activity they start cutting out. Another issue I had with the first pair was the touch pad on the ear bud started flaking off (these were returned)."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-04-05,"TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! Value, based on cost, is not at all worth it. Like, AT ALL! TERRIBLE!","Yet again, I tried out a Samsung product and at 2 months and 1 week in, I had problems. It does not charge wirelessly at 2 months use every day or every other day. The connectivity during phone calls since day 11 are absolutely horrible. I get about 12-21 seconds into a phone call with these and NOBODY CAN HEAR ME, LIKE EVER!!!!!! I'm beyond angry and I want my money back because I got roped off but apparently Samsung won't issue me a refund because, ""I made a bad choice"". Really!?!? Really Samsung!?!? Wow! Way to keep up that customer satisfaction and keep your name trustworthy. I'm extremely displeased with these ear buds. They worked great for about 7 days, 1 hour, and 12 minutes. I documented it based on what it showed I used. LG headset and Google pixel buds will blow this crap product it of the water! I'm so angry with Samsung! Very very VERY unhappy with this product!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-05,Very very disappointed 😔,Order first pair Feb 17th by the 29th I was ordering another pair got those on march 1st today is April 5 and same problem on new pair both volume go extremely low in one speaker. Dont believe YouTube videos about touchpad volume helps this it dont. Also if ear wax gets behind silver gill speaker sound like it's not even on only way to fix this is basically destroying the buds by taking the grill of (which u cant put back on) and cleaning black fiber thing behind the grill...dont waste ur money u been WARNED!!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-05,this one is better,super
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-06,One earbud never works,I have ordered two pairs and in both cases one does not work. I had to send them back twice
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,Great product!,This product stands up to the Samsung name!! I love the ambient option. I love being able to hear what's going on around me but yet my music sounds great. Wonderful job Samsung!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-06,Don't buy it.,"Looks cheap, And quality was not as expected."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-06,Good while it lasted.,Well they sounded dope while they worked 100%. I bought these day 1 and they were great. A month and a half later when I get a phone call they have a weird tinny sound to them and it's annoying to listen to. While listening to music or videos it sounds great. Phone calls sound like garbage.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,Now have 1 bud ambient sound,"I might be a little bias. Im a Samsung guy, love my galaxy stuff. They are better than original buds. Not a big difference in sound. The sound is always good. The improvement is in the battery life, ambient is stronger and can be used wearing only 1 bud now. I have heard from people I talk to on the phone that the sound on there end is better. I think that's due to the extra mic on the buds+. So improvements basically extra mic for sound on your caller's end and ambient. As well as 1 bud ambient. Last, battery life on buds and case."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,Best battery life,Great sound quality as well as battery life. I've had mines for use at work to listen to music and I haven't charged them yet for past week. You can also use 1 at a time to extend life of battery and the easiest bluetooth pairing for Samsung devices
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-06,Decent headphones but a little over priced,"Good for everyday use, fits well"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-07,Best Earbuds! Worth the Investment!,I'm loving these already! Only had them about a week but so far so good. I was worried about them fitting in my ears good because of my piercings but they fit fine. Only complaint is I couldn't be heard well with all of my windows down driving. That's typical though.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-07,Unacceptable for phone calls,"These things have adequate sound for listening to podcasts and music. The equalizer is pretty much non-existent. None of the settings make much difference. The received sound during telephone calls is marginal, the transmitted sound is an unintelligible staticky mess. No one can understand anything I say. If I wasn’t passed the return date, I’d send them back. Fail on the telephone use, adequate on the rest."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-07,Slips out of my ear,"Great earbuds but they don't stay in my ear. When I smile or do anything with my face, even though they are very tight and sealed, they slip off and I have to be constantly pressing to keep them in place."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-07,iPhone 11 Pro Max user,"So I just received the Samsung Buds +, right out of the box, they required a charge which went quick. I'm happy about that. I did purchase the Airpod Pros and I really didn't like the fact they didn't stay in my ear. I tried all 3 sizes and none had a good fit. These Buds+ right out of the box fit great, I think it has something to do with the wing that secures the bud in the ear and are very comfortable. The app for the iPhone works very well. I understand if you have the original Samsung Buds, the app will not work. There was an update waiting for me as soon as it connected. I will update once I have had a chance to listen to music, test the ambient noise etc. But so far, so really good. UPDATE: I have used the Galaxy Bud+ for conference calls, I was told the call was super clear from my end. I have also listened to music and because I have different listening options through the app, I can select how I want to hear the music. These are AirPod pro killers, my pair is going back once the the Apple store opens again. I believe you will be very happy with these Galaxy Bud+."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-07,Best quality,Bought them for my fiance birthday and he loves them!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Great product,"It is small, discreet. Great sound and easy to use."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,I'm glad I purchased them,"I debated whether I should buy these or not for a long time. I checked reviews, looked at reviews on YouTube, and then asked a friend who has a pair. She loves her pair so I purchased them. I have no regrets. Pairing them to my Galaxy S7 took 2 seconds. The sound quality is so clear and crisp. On the phone and speaking on the phone the person I'm speaking to can hear me clearly. The only thing that took me a long time was figuring what size wings and tips so they don't fall out. Size small tips, medium size wing tips. My next difficult decision is what skin do I want to protect the case."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,"I used to think it was silly, but I can't go anywhere without them now.","I stubbornly clung to my wired earbuds, and grabbed some cheap off-brand bluetooth wrap-arounds to use with yard work, but I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about with these new Buds+ models. They blew me away. I didn't expect the sound quality to be that noticeably higher. I didn't expect them to be so comfortable, or so well ""stuck"" in the ear (a major issue for working outside, or exercise), and I didn't expect the sound-passthrough to be so useful or well implemented. The touch controls are FAST and just the right amount of sensitivity. JUST MAKE SURE YOU TRY THE EXTRA SIZE FITTINGS. When I put them on the first time they sounded great and stayed in the ear, but they had wiggle room to rotate around about 30 degrees. I had no idea this wasn't ideal. After the first week I thought I'd try the large sized wingtips and silicone inserts - it's a whole new fit, and even more impressive than the first time. Far more comfortable over long periods, too. The case fits in the lighter pocket of my jeans, and they've joined the EDC club."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-08,Fix this,"Its good works well and all but all of a suden, the left one gives up. The left one now does not hold a charge anymore, its bugged. Im going to return it"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-04-08,some might be defective,Within 3 days the battery was not charging and I could not get a new one sent to me for the return policy I am hoping that Amazon can send me a new True wireless headphones the ones that got sent to me are defective.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,All I can say is ... wow,"These are great. I've had air pods, which kept falling out of my ears and that got annoying. I currently have Power Beats Pro, but they disconnect from my Samsung Galaxy and dont have a great deal or bass ironically. These are excellent. The software works great, the separate woofer is noticeable and of course it pairs easy and works seamlessly with my S10+. I was on the fence given how much I had paid got the beats, but these are well worth it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Awesome!,Met every expectation of what I've been looking for.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-08,"Excellent product, but they wont stay in my ears.","The battery life, audio quality and compatibility with my note 9 is wonderful. They connect super fast, the ambient sound feature works great. My problem lies with these things constantly loosening and falling from my ears. I have tried all 3 sets of tips and wings, all giving me the same problem. Very dissatisfied that I cant use these without constantly making sure they stay in place."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Great Buds,"Great sound quality, extremely easy setup and use. Definitely recommend."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Very Nice! Great for conference calls,"I got these specifically because of the good reviews it got for call quality. I am impressed for the price. Everyone I ask says my audio quality is very high. Sound quality is awesome when sitting still. I have the problem that the buds seal your ear shut and you can hear your heartbeat. Any change in the pressure of your ear canal can be heard. Walking and running for me with these in is a ""no go"". Battery life is as advertised. I am really very happy with these for the price."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-08,good sound - ambient mode is poor,"The sound quality is good, not magnificent, but for true wireless at this price point, you're not going to blow your ears away. The microphone is also good enough. People say they can hear me on calls just fine. Again, not as good as a dedicated voice headset, but that's not what I was expecting. The one true disappointment is ""ambient"" mode, where it lets in sound from your environment. Ambient mode is terrible. To notice any difference you have to turn the ambient volume all the way up, and even then it's spotty and the pass-through quality is bad. Lots of headphones or even ear protection have ambient pass through. It's old tech that should be easy enough to execute on. They missed the boat on that feature and it cost them 1 star. Otherwise I'm completely satisfied with the purchase. Ambient was not a huge deal for me."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-09,Decepcionante,Nunca lo supe pues no me llego lo la caja porque dentro solo tenía basura
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-09,"Great sound quality, poor fit for the ears","I love everything about these buds but the only problem and the most important part of an earbud, is that they stay in your ear, these do not stay in very well. It might just be my ear shape but it's still highly disappointing considering the sound quality is amazing."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-09,Battery life no where near 11,I have only one complaint about these buds and it’s the battery life.I only get about 6 hours on a full charge compared to the 11 advertised. I might have received one with a defect
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-09,Amazing battery life,They sound amazing and fit good in my ears and they look amazing
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-10,SAMSUNG LA MEJOR,Se les paso la mano en la CALIDAD de SONIDO Su Batería La Mejor que he Probado Muy Como .Felicidades SAMSUNG Sigan Trabajando con esa CALIDAD. LA MEJOR DEL MUNDO.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-10,Right earbud does not work,"I was totally excited to receive these earbuds as they were an upgrade from the 1st generation in terms of microphone quality and battery life. However upon opening the box the right side bud never paired with my samsung phone or the left side ear bud. I tried updating the app (which would not be allowed unless both earbuds are paired). I restarted my phone as well as tried charging the buds and case until they were both at 100%. Still no luck. The left side paird perfectly. I have used the 1st gen airbuds about 6 months now and my only issue was the microphone quality. While on a call persons would have trouble hearing me at random points throughout the conversation. Thats why i decided to upgrade. Ordered a replacement, hopefully it comes with no issues."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-10,Not even two months,"Bought mine in the middle of Feb. They sound great and I used them all the time throughout the day. The noise canceling feature works just the way I like. Beginning of April the connection between the buds to my phone started to go out randomly. I want to say after the last update around that time. I disconnected them and even uninstalled them and now only the right bud has sound. The left one is on but it doesn't connect at all. In the app it just shows as disconnected but it still beeps when I press it. I hoped they would lasted longer, didn't even have them for two months."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-10,Defective,Right earphone volume is lower then the left only had them a few months.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-10,Well done Samsung,"Best quality and inexpensive 🥰🥰
I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 black
a Samsung Galaxy Watch 42mm rose gold
And now these awesome
Samsung Galaxy Buds+ well done Samsung I'm pleased with your products 🥰🥰🥰🥰"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-10,best,super nice the best for calls and noise cancellation
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-10,Oustanding,"Have many Samsung products as with my others I am extremely impressed at these earbuds. They have a great fit and do not even feel like you are wearing them, even when working out. Highly recommeded"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-10,Would Recommend to Everyone,"Before buying these, I had Zolo Liberty wireless earbuds for several years that I used heavily at work. I got these because those old ones couldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour anymore. My first impression was how small and light the case was. I was even more surprised by how light the earbuds themselves were. My Zolo Liberty case felt easily 5 times the weight of this one. When I put them on, there was such a night and day difference with the feel of the earbuds themselves. They feel so lightweight and comfortable that I could see myself forgetting I'm wearing them. My old Zolo Liberty earbuds would always hurt my ears after wearing them for longer than a couple hours and I'd have to lodge them into there good, for fear of them falling out. After unboxing these new earbuds, I downloaded the app to go along. I'd not read all the details of them before getting them but was nonetheless excited to see what they could do. The app allows you to not only see the exact charge on the individual earbuds and the case, but also set the level of ambient sound from off to levels of 1-3. There is a wonderful equalizer that I messed around with a bit and was glad to see it actually does change your sound quite a lot. Aside from that, you can change what the touch controls do when you hold them down. I set holding down the left button to open Spotify, which works flawlessly. It even has feedback sounds to let you know your input was taken. You're able to turn the volume up/down in this way if you wish, by changing the settings in the app.
The final thing which I can imagine coming in handy eventually is a Find My Earbuds in the app. If you lose one of them, it'll emit a beeping to help you find it. This would have been great to have for all the times I dropped one of my Zolo Liberty earbuds and had to crawl around on the floor to recover it. All in all, I'm very excited to spend a few years with these things. The functionality seems wonderful and I'm looking forward to the long battery life on them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-11,Don't spend all the extra money for the Bose sport.,"I was impressed with the microphones. When you have ambient sound on high, when your not listening to music or whatever, I can hear better like a hearing aid. I have hearing loss working in a steel shop 30 years."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-11,I had to buy a pair for myself!,They are amazing I got these for my husband.... And he loves them so much he thanks me for them almost everyday LOL .
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-11,Another win for Samsung.,Best 👂 earbuds I ever purchased. Usually have a hard time finding the correct size tips. Not with these. Found the correct pair and they provided a nice snug fit which improves low frequency bass. HAPPY 😊 Noise cancelation is amazing. Thanks Samsung and AKG for an amazing job!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,You won't be disappointed,Love it!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,Great for the price,Can't wait for the next model to have more intuitive controls
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,Would recommend,"Love them, very comfortable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,WOW!,I only have one word to say - WOW!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,Amazing,Love my buds plus. Great fit & sound quality is amazing. No issues with phone calls like original buds had. Would purchase again without hesitating.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-13,"Received regular Galaxy Buds, NOT Galaxy Buds+","Ordered the Galaxy Buds+, received the original Galaxy Buds in a Buds + case. Bit of a scam. Definitely exchanging these."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-13,All Boxes Ticked,"I love these things these are officially the 5th pair of Bluetooth headphones I've owned and I've come to learn you get what you pay for. These don't have the issues the cheap sets do. I don't have to worry about them randomly turning on, connecting, and taking audio off of my car speaker and throwing it into headphones in the center console where I can't hear it. Not an issue with these babies. I even had someone in public notice them and ask what brand they were. That's never happened. I highly recommend these. Excellent ambient sound balancing (most interesting/unique feature) noise cancelling, firmware update via app. Ultra portable, excellent battery, wireless charging. All boxes ticked."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-13,button flexibility lacking,"I just received my new Galaxy Buds + and mostly love them! One functionality not available via the app's area where you can customize the long press buttons:
I want to modify the buttons so that I can keep long press on right earbud for Google Assistant AND have volume controls on left bud. Talked with Sammy support and they said no. Seems a bit retarded because both of those functions are super useful."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-13,I dig these,"LOVE these, ambient mode is fantastic, case charges on my samsung watch stand"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-13,Awsome,"Wow i also got the original and this one both are awsome, their is no such thing as noise cancelation it just minimize the amount of sound u can hear, great call quality and battery power last about 20hrs for a full discharge."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-13,Great overall earbuds with long battery life.,"These little guys go above and beyond on what I expected. Great sound quality, long Bluetooth connectivity and last all day! The one thing that I'm not super partial about is the hearing your surrounding part of it, luckily it can be turned off but when it is used, white noise becomes an issue, ie; fans."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-13,"Pretty good, especially for the price.","PROS
Sound quality good
Comfortable
Battery life is 11 hrs on buds, 11 hours on case
Controls are easy to learn
CONS
Not water proof
No active noise canceling
Ear buds differ when discharging
Example L=89% R=72%"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,Very Happy,I am very happy with my purchase. Just that the case battery drains faster than I thought and I am wondering if it's normal? Anybody having the same issue?
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,Awesome mixed with awesome.,Love these. Hands down the best headset I've had.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-04-14,Nice upgrade from original buds.,Well worth it! I have these matched with Galaxy Note 10+ and Galaxy Watch. I would definitely buy again.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,Nice job,Good overall earbuds but kinda overpriced.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,"comfortable, cool design and features. Long battery life",Bought these to workout in. I don't use the ambient noise feature outside running due to the fact it causes too much wind noise. Turning this feature off and you won't hear wind noise. I think the sound quality is pretty good. Could use more bass in my opinion. The earbuds charge quickly and the battery life is long. I love the styling and the fit of the ear buds out of the case fit really snug. There are several rubber adapter buds to find one that fits your ear best. Connects to the phone very easily. Cool animation on your phone when you open the ear bud case showing you battery life of the case and each ear bud. Tap the left ear bud edge to decrease volume and right buf to increase volume. You can pause by tapping and change tracks. Many more features. My wife wants a pair now. Only downfall is that the case is small and I am afraid I will lose them at some point. There is a find my ear buds feature on my phone though. :)
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-14,They fall out of my ear very easily.,They won't stay in my ear.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-14,Not head phones you'll want to wear for long periods of time.,"The ""touch screen "" component is both cool and horrible at the same time as I find myself accidentally pressing it when adjusting the bud. I've hung up quite a few times on accident, almost everytime actually lol. The call quality is excellent both on my side and being able to be heard, seems like the buds pick up quite a lot of surrounding noises too, for example my husband can always hear the kids talk even from across the room. It can go a reasonable distance away from the phone. Charging is easy if you already own Samsung products, can be charged wirelessly too! Set up was a breeze because I already own galaxy products. If you wear these too much you will probably get an ear infection as of course it traps the... ahem ""ear mist"". BUT that's just what happens with buds in general. I think I'll be keeping these as I am only going to be wearing these for certain activities and for not for long hours at a time."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-15,Works great,Works great
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-15,No me sirve,No sé lo que pasa sale con otro audífono
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,Great earbuds.,Tried plenty of earbuds and headphones. These i like. One thing I like is that you can go to a previous song. Not many of them can do that. Sound is great. I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 5G Ultra and it works great with it.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,Great product,Great product
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,Great ear buds!,"These are AMAZING, especially with a Samsung phone. They auto connect to your phone. They know when they are in/out your ear. Great sound quality and exclude ambient noise. They sit in your ear well, no fallout, and are mighty comfortable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,Great earbuds!,I have no complaints for the earbuds. They are amazing in every way. The tiniest downside is that the charger cable does not come with the piece that you plug into the outlet; only the cable itself. But the earbuds are incredible and arrived very very fast.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,"Perfect comfortable, awesome sound quality!","Fast delivery, sound great! These fit perfectly. Hardly know they are actually in my ear. Stay securely while exercising, while out for a run, or doing yard work. ***Note that I had issues with low volume until I set one for volume up, and the other for volume down. It's all in the Buds+ app."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-16,"Great, but not for me","These earbuds have excellent sound quality and battery life, but if you don't like in-ear earphones, these aren't for you. They don't go too deep in your ear canal, but they do create that ""underwater"" feeling that many of these types of earbuds have. If you have a samsung phone and the included AKG earbuds fit you well, then you'll love these."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,"Actually better than I expected, a lot better.","I have worn these for working at home. Both to use as calls and to listen to music. You come to better understand the noise reduction when you use the ambient sound feature that allows you to hear the audio ""outside"". It really keeps you from ""yelling"" on the phone calls. Very satisfied with them, and I have forgotten they were on a few times. I did have to use my own tips, but that's because I am probably more fussy than most."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-16,"Great handsfree, mediocre bass quality on speakers","Great handsfree, mediocre bass quality on speakers. For earbuds which cost almost $150, I would have expected that the sound quality would be a lot better. I want to be able to really feel the bass, especially when I'm listening working out! The reason I kept these earbuds is because the handsfree for calls is excellent! And I really needed that. Overall a 3.5 star for me. If these earbuds cost $50 it would have been a 4 star."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-16,Couldn't pair to my Oneplus 7T,They are very nice earphones and have a good long lasting battery. Quality of sound is acceptable but not o par with the better ones like Jabra abd Beats. My main problem with them was that I couldn't pair them with my daily driver Oneplus7T. I tried and tried and tired... but no luck even after I unpaired them several times and reinstall Galaxy Wear app. They worked just fine with my other phone Note 10 + though. So I have to return them as I planned to use them with both of my phones and stay with the cheap ones I bought earlier from Amazon. They had no problem pairing with any phones in my household
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-16,Great features but poor sound quality and loose in ears,"I know with Bluetooth you can always expect a degraded sound compared to hard wired headphones, but these were worse than normal. There's a persistent low-volume hiss, and all highs sound shrill with a hint of distortion. I ran them for 10 hours, just in case there was any break-in difference, but none was heard. Features are great, they pair really easy (Galaxy S8 and S20) and the ambient function is excellent and impressive. But, headphones at this price should sound better. The fit was OK, but I expected them to be more stable in the ear, as they felt like they were always going to fall out, no matter the tip size. Returned."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-17,Amazing quality,"Amazing sound quality!! The ambience noise that allows you to still hear the noises around you really makes it seem like you're not even wearing headphones when there's no music playing. The case is incredibly compact and has a very slick design. The headphones themselves fit almost perfectly in my ear with just the stock gummies. They have about 11 hours of play time per ear for audio, which is fantastic. These are the best headphones I've gotten, and offer a customizable equalizer on the app as well. 10 out of 10 would recommend, have only had for 2 days."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,0,2020-04-17,Don't waste your money. Go with Raycon.,"They're decent as far as ear buds but, after about a month of use, I went to sleep with my left bud on my dresser and it died. The next day it stopped working even after charging for 24 hours. I have tried resetting, turning off and on, trying to disconnect and reconnect, and still there is that red exclamation point on the left indicating it won't connect. After looking online I learned that this is a common issue and, for upward of 120$, I don't feel like the left ear bud should just stop working."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-17,Awesome buy!,"Loved these!! Work really good with my I phone,! !"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,0,2020-04-17,Very Poor Fitting-Sound is Very Lacking,"I'm sure that if you can get a good seal in your ears with these that they could sound decent. I just got these and the largest size tips are barely a medium size in other types of tips. I was searching for large but the largest these have are still way too small for my ears so I cannot get any type of seal. I will see if I can find a substitute tip that will work for my ears, BUT, I am concerned about the tiny case these come in and any larger tips may not fit in the case for charging which will be a big problem. I can't understand why they are designed the way they are...case is too small, tips are too small and because of the small case, this will limit tip substitutes. I luckily get these using points I had from Samsung otherwise I would immediately send these back. Even with correct size tips, not sure they will work due to their design...I am amazed of the overall good reviews for these...they all must have tiny ears. UPDATE- I was able to custom fit some SHURE foam tips I have using my Dremel tool to enlarge the hole on the foam tip so they would fit the earbuds.....did make that seal that is needed and did improve the sound a bit. I also went back to my phone and located an app that allows you to increase the volume significantly. Even after all that, I would rate these 2.5 stars, maybe 3 for sound quality....but, out of the box, these just don't work at all for fit and sound quality....you really have to do some work to make them sound just OK."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,"Compared to Sony and Apple; Good Buy, Good Upgrade to Buds","The infamous sony wireless earbuds, which everyone raves over, do sound better than these, and the Apple AirPods Pro Sound significantly worse than these. Buds+ are a solid buy for Apple and Android users, and I use mine for both. The huge advantages they have over other headphones is the quality of the ambient sound feature, the two driver design gives them far more range than Apple Pros, the case is 1/10 the size of the Sony case, and the buds last longer than the Sonys. Overall, I have held onto my Sonys and these, and not the Apple, Master & Dynamic or Klipsch. The Samsung Buds+ are a significant improvement over the Buds, and if you own the Buds I would recommend the upgrade to the Buds+. I do like the sound on the Sonys better, but the carry case is so big that Buds+ are often my buds of choice. Because I am an audiophile, who avoids using bluetooth whenever possible to begin with, the convience of better battery and smaller case is a good trade off in your non-primary listening device. One huge difference between the Buds and Buds+, is the soundquality on calls with the Buds+ is infinitely better. It is worth the upgrade."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Great sound and Battery,"Great sound and excellent battery life. If you are looking for a great pair of earbuds in the 100 to 150 range these are great. Calls are great, everyone can hear me clear. That's the biggest difference when you make a jump from a cheaper pair of buds. Tip: there is an equalizer in the wear app, but if your phone has eq settings, you can fine tune your sound. I have a Note 9 with Dobly where I can set the eq for each BT device separately."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Would buy again.,Better than the original buds. Updates make the white noise in ambient sound way less noticeable. Comfortable fit. Sound quality better with two drivers. Battery life is amazing.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,"Just do it already, you know you wanna",Incase you are debating on getting wireless headphones or not. I gotta say I got just got the Galaxy Buds+ today & they rock! For being a female & having smaller ears & worrying that they wouldn't be comfortable I can say they are comfortable & that the sound is amazing! If you are an Android/Samsung user do it! They are much better then the wired AKGs that come with Samsung phones.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Great!,Great!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Sound is incredible.,Smartphone adjustments for sound. pairing is easy. Comfortable to wear. Stays in even when sweaty.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Like hearing a new world for the first time,"Absolutely love these. I'm amazed by the battery life, the ambient sound feature, and the sound quality. I recommend getting these to anyone. They fit perfectly in my ears but come with 3 different size buds and ear pieces for all different sizes. I even tried to make them fall out but couldn't. And with the ambient sound feature you can just go outside and listen to nature and all the sounds around you crystal clear like having sharing aids."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Absolutely excellent,"These are comfortable. They sound great. The ambient audio pass though works EXCELLENT ,but can be disabled. Wonderful battery life. If you have a Samsung phone, it gets even better. You won't regret this buy"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-18,Was expecting better quality after reading seller's description and reviews,"Took buds for test walk. Experienced poor quality sound compared to wired Panasonic with Mic, static and fading of music. Too disappointed to try a phone call."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-18,Falls out of my ear as soon as move my Mouth!!,I've been using Samsung products since 2011 when I switched over from a IPhone and I've been a happy customer until now! I've tried every combination of the tips they provided and regardless of which one I use or if I get a good seal or not in my ear as soon as start talking or smiling the earbuds fall out! 2 days after I got them one of them fell out on my run and almost went down the sewer! I'm really disappointed with this product I hope I Can return them.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Nice and so easy to use,Peeerfeeeeect
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-18,Skip them go with another brand,Fit well... but the sound quality is very poor. Almost no base...
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Great battery life,Best truly wireless earphones I've tried. Great battery life as well. No complaints
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-19,"Great headphones, battery life on case is an issue",Great headphones and all my only concern is the case battery life. It looks like the battery drains even if the headphones are at 100% battery life. I have airpods and these take over the airpods but as far as battery life on the case goes airpods beat these.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-19,Galaxy Buds+.....really dope,"I normally don't write reviews however when a product works well we have to tell others. I have a Samsung s8 (soon upgrading to the s20 ultra). I also own Samsung gear s3 smart watch and a few Samsung televisions. The Galaxy Buds+ synced up really with my phone. They have this feature called Ambient sound. It works extremely well if you work in a environment were you have to be aware of surrounding, however if the volume of your media is too high you won't be able to understand a person talking next to you. I personally love this because I can listen to music while I also interact with the outside world all without taking my headphones off. They are small and light weight. My dreadlocks covers mines, so people often don't notice I'm wearing them. I love that they charge wirelessly in case. The case is a bit small for my liking and also very smooth. The equalizer controls are in the galaxy wearable app, and are comparable to their labeling. I prefer to be able to control my equalizer level in all ranges. The controls are a simple series of taps and a tap and hold command. The tap and hold commands can be changed from either voice command, spotify, Ambient sound, volume up, volume down for either right or left ear bud. One thing to be aware of is that if choose to use tap and hold as volume control the other earbud will automatically set other earbud as well. I love that if miss place a earbud I can make it alert. Music and media sound quality is great. The call quality is wonderful when coupled with the ambient sound because your able to hear yourself and the person your talking to clearly. The only thing about these earbuds that I don't like is that if you use the ambient sound feature you have to be careful not to cover the bottom mic otherwise causes feedback loop."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-19,Definitely recommended buying!,Great sound!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-19,"Sounds is good, fit not so much....","Overall the sound quality is good, I give this a sold 4 starts for the tech and sound. However it gets a 1 start for fit (averaged to 3 star). I bought these to wear out at the stable while taking care of our horses. I have tried all combinations of the rubber earpieces trying to make it so these don't fall out of my ear with no success. I've already had several cases where one of the buds falls out in the stall with the horse nearly stepping on it. These will likely work fine as long as you use them in your car, home or office, anything where not a lot of movement is involved, I would expect taking a walking would be OK too. Actives like yard work or anything involving bending over or a moderate amount of activity may cause you trouble. I'm not an Apple fan (quite the opposite) but I'm really wishing I had bought the Airpods instead..."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Sweet product!,These things are pretty sweet! Great sound. Very comfortable. And the touch buttons work nice. Saw some people want a push button but they work very smoothly. Very impressed.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-20,"Does not isolate very much at all; ambient sound feature is unrealistic, very poor quality","I was quite disappointed at how little sound insulation I got from these earbuds! Even with a good, snug fit, that little piece of rubber just isn't anywhere near the ability of over-the-ear headphones. I cannot tell any difference whether adaptive cancellation is on, or not. For any scenario dealing with the traffic noise of passing cars, the feature MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE THERE AT ALL. The sound quality is passable, in particular if you have diminished hearing in the upper ranges. However, making room for the tweeters inside the unit takes away any sort of powerful bass. I believe I should have gone with a different product, now -- one that employs a larger driver. Such products are available for a lot less than I paid for this one."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-20,For the quality I fill it was a little over priced,"Over all there good ear buds. You definitely dont want to sit your phone down and walk away. It does not have good range! Also if phone is in back pocket it cuts in and out!! I fill they could be a little louder, for the first 3 days my ears hirt bad then I got used to them..."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,IT os really good,"IT is what I was looking for,IT is Amazon
it is really good and confortable ítem"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,AAAAA++++++,Awesome product would buy many times over
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Great sound quality!,Amazing sound quality for blootooth headphones. As long as you have an ear tight seal the noise cancelling works great as well and the battery life works a strong 24 hours with constant use. Now to find a case I like!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Love em,Another excellent product offered through Amazon
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-20,I found my all around my TWS.,"I have been trying to find an ear-bud that can be used while sleeping and otherwise. I have tried a number of them, get - try - return multiple times. I was trying a mid-range price point no luck. I decided that it was time to bump up my price for the fact that I will be using them every night. I have a pair of 1More (which I love but falls out of my ears all night). I have also found that they maybe can be used continuously for at the most 7 hours. I have used the Samsung buds+ once and love them they did not fall out, and still have a good amount of juice to last for a good 3 or 4 hours more (total 11 hours). A couple of things I love is that the buds can be used completely independently (just like 1More), which is one of the main things I look for in earbuds. A long battery life (which the Samsung buds have). I have a galaxy S10+ and it integrated with my phone with ease, and they have an app that is easy to use. The buds have a cool feature which I have also used is the ambient sounds thing lets me be able to talk to someone I am very excited about this new thing! There is no ANC, but that is not really needed because the earbuds cover my ear canal enough where I do not get any of the outside world. So at the moment, my overall evaluation is excellent. I will keep posted throughout the next month or so and what it is like to live with."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Perfcto,Me encanta duración de bateria exelente
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,Best!,Have had alot of these kind of earbuds over the years and these are by far the best I have had! 6 hours of listening to music and still had 59% battery life!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,Don't try to save money on refurbished,"I purchased refurbished ones about a week before I I ordered these, and let me tell you the difference is immeasurable. The buds plus are fantastic, the fit the sound and call features are awesome!! Would definitely recommend."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-21,Earbuds,Only sometimes the earbuds didn’t start the music you have to go in with your phone but the sound is good
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,Earbuds,Great earbuds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Comfortable,I couldn't be happier with my purchase. They are extremely comfortable. When paired with my active 2 I can listen to music while offline. This allows me to leave my phone at home during runs. Battery life is incredible.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-22,Disappointing,These buds are horrible! I can’t make any phone calls for a long before the Bluetooth connection drops!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-22,Easy to connect,"Great battery, but phone calls are a little funny to hear every now and then (not often) great sound to drain the noise"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,(Expletive) AMAZING!!,"If I were to describe these headphones using the full spectrum of the colorful language of my people, amazon would never publish my review so I’ll settle for trying to express myself without using any foul language. These things are (expletive typically used to describe fornication however also used to express strong feeling or excitement; in this case excitement) AMAZING! I loved my old headphones and recommend them to everyone, but they are absolute (excrement) compared to these beautiful (male children of female canines) the sound quality not just when listening but also on calls is (fornicating) incredible! The ambient sound feature is really what sets these apart, I’ve never had that in a headphone and I love it! When listening to music, you can block out all other sounds but when the music is off, even with the headphones still in you can hear the clunk of ant (excrement) from across the room! The shipping was incredibly fast too. We are in the middle of the (deity cursed, maternal figure fornicating) covid crisis and they still shipped these to me in less than 36 hours. (Fornicating) incredible! Great job everyone at Samsung. I wish I could buy all you beautiful (children of female canines) a beer!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,A must for Samsung users,Big improvements from the last model buds. These give apple a run for their money and they come in multiple colors
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Better than I had hoped,Wonderful sound and quality they fit excellent they are better than I had hoped
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,0,2020-04-22,Very good quality,I like these very much. More comfortable than other Bluetooth earbuds I've tried and very good sound.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Great clarity I recommend,I love these earbuds the sound is great plus when you speak over the phone people can hear you very clearly unlike the the previous earbuds I recommend this to anybody because the sound quality is great and the voice comes out clear when you are talking over the phone
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-22,Sound quality,Like the quality of sound and how it easily connects to my android phone.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,"Had the originals, these are better!","I have used a lot of different wireless ear buds. From other vendors, what I can say is after using them all the Samsung buds were and still remain my favorite. You will hear complaints of missing premium features like built in mp3 player with out your phone and such non-sense, honestly all those features are silly. At the end of the day I am rarily with out my phone within arms reach, and even less do I leave with out it. With these headsets, I have them paired to anything with Bluetooth, they connect easily seamlessly, they stay in my ears and sound great regardless of what activities I am doing. The battery is long enough that I never need to worry about being caught with them not charged. Simply put these are the best bang for buck."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-22,Why you shouldn't buy Samsung buds,"Its really great product but the only issue with it is the battery life for the left side, it doesn't last long as the right side. Now it stopped charging at all! Plus at that price I would expect something really good"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Good,Love it
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Ambient amazingness,So far so good! I love these super handy and versatile! I use them with several devices and and i love the ambient sound option definitely helps with the kids around
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Truly wireless earbuds the provide excellent sound!,Love the small form factor! The truly wireless capability is excellent.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Highly recommend!,"This is my first time using ear plugs, I am impressed!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Excelente producto,"La verdad es que el producto de lo mejor, la calidad del sonido no tiene igual, rebaso mis expectativas, la bateria le dura bastante y muy cómodo. ampliamente recomendado"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-23,Good quality for the price,"Easy to pair with Galaxy watch, reasonable sound quality, light and small, ideal for workout"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-23,Great headphones! Slip a little in my ears,"I have enjoyed this headphones! However, seems I may have weird ears as the buds after long time
of use have a tendency of loosening and falling out. I have tried the different bud sizes to no luck,"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-24,Hoodwinked,Bought these for the ambient noise. I've only ever used one ear bud. Thought these would be a great way to enjoy using both. However that feature is only available when using a app that requires access to everything on your phone. This is unacceptable. It should be available stand alone. A simple pattern a pushes wouldn't have been hard to add. Guess the opportunity to make more profit was to hard for them to pass up.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Clean & discreet!,Love these buds I use them all the time at work
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Grear,Great
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,0,2020-04-24,So far the best I have owned,"Purchased from Best Buy. Out of Jaybird, Beats and off market brands from my past, Samsung Earbuds plus is the best. I have already recommended to a friend. Easiest set to fit in my ear, sound and call quality are great. I carried a one hour phone call session while walking around the lake (practiced social distancing). Although the recipient didn't realize I was outside during our conversation."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-24,"Battery Life not as advertised and poor signal, wasn't expecting this from Samsung.!!!!!!!","***Always, one earbud dies first than the other, usually the left one. ***Signal strength is very poor, the music skips few seconds and cuts itself from a pocket distance, and also sometimes my phone is in the counter while me being in the stove cooking. ***Volume edge feature doesn't work. ***IM STARTING TO THINK THIS ARE GALAXY BUDS NOT GALAXY BUDS PLUS, BUT IN THE AP IT SAYS THEY ARE THE PLUS SO IM CONFUSED***
BOUGHT THEM BECAUSE OF THE ""11"" HOURS AND NOT EVEN CLOSE, AT MOST 7 HOURS. VERY DISSAPOINTED"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,So far one of the best airbuds !,Yes finally i have the new buds plus ! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Just Buy Them! Incredible Sound.,"I'm normally pretty picky about my music. I've had many earbuds and they've all been disappointing. Picked up the Galaxy Buds + as it seemed to have excellent reviews. My Buds+ arrived today and I installed the Wear app on my Galaxy Note 9. For me, I had to change out the ear canal inserts to get a nice fit. These buds are very comfortable...unbelievable. I normally use Amazon Music since it seems to have much better sound than Pandora. I fired up some music and could not believe how nice these sound. They have an excellent, clear and clean sound quality. Bass is surprisingly very nice, not overpowering, but it's there. Once I got the buds fitting nice and the app set, the music is just incredible. Also, the battery life is amazing. Currently, I'm on my first charge and I'm at 5 hours and only at 70%. The range is great, I got about 50-60 feet away before it started skipping. For this price point, there is nothing that's going to sound better than the Buds+. Nice job Samsung!!! Just buy them....you won't be disappointed."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Great,Great
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Sweet buds,I love that I can hear everything around me and pretend I can not. The sound is great and I can still play music while hearing my surroundings. Stays put and I have made it as far as 50 feet away from my device in an office without losing reception.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,best earbuds I've owned,Amazing
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-25,only one,I bought this as a Birthday gift and my little brother was so excited to finally have these and he opened them and it only came with one ear bud. For $150 I would expect these things to be listed correctly. I am beyond upset and will not be purchasing from this company again if I cannot get this resolved.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-26,Would not hold connection,"I wanted to love these as I have Bose version. But they would not hold connection even with my Note 10+, I also kinda wonder if these were a return and they did not exactly match the picture on the site."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-26,Not with the bass that I expected for the price.,"Amazing battery life. A bit heavy on your ears, and you get tired of them after an hour. Non discrete. ""Adapt Sound"" function is annoying. TIP: No bass when you connect them, but it re-establish when you volume down to the bottom, and then slowly go up."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-26,Great Earbuds,"Great fit and function, great sound quality. With the ambient sound feature turned off they are very good at blocking external sound. They work very well for phone calls as well. Battery life is fantastic, easily 10+ hours on a charge plus the rapid recharge in the case can easily give you a few more hours in just minutes or a complete charge in an hour or so. Highly recommend."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-26,"If you buy it for laptop, don't. But good for Samsung phones","During the covid-19 quarantine, I attend lots of video or audio conference meetings from my Lenovo laptop and galaxy buds+ sometimes do not work properly. Microphone just randomly stops working and cause lots of problems for me. But with my Samsung galaxy phone, I haven't faced any earbuds issues. Biggest disadvantage is that there is no mute button or noise cancellation. It is 2020 but Samsung still launches new products as it is 2010."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-26,Excellent,One of the best earbuds that I encountered I highly recommend them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-26,Better than gen 1? Not in sound.,"These things don't sound very good to me, in fact they sound just as bad as the gen 1 version which my wife has. When I compare them to the standard corded AKG buds that came with my Galaxy S9 there's absolutely no comparison. The corded phones have more clear bass, smoother presence, less fatiguing highs. You know, like real headphones. The upgraded sound was the main selling point and why I decided to spend the extra money on these but I'm disappointed. I'm sticking with my corded phones for music listening while these are just for meetings and phone calls."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-04-26,GARBAGE PRODUCT - LIFETIME SAMSUNG CUSTOMER,I have tons of Samsung products from TVs to laptops. First earphones from them. They have worst connectivity than the S9 from Motorola in like 2008. It took a few calls to realize how bad it was than they refused to refund because it was 15 days. Trash product. Trash company.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-26,These are amazing...until you use both buds at once and split the bluetooth signal,"I did a lot of research before going with the Galaxy Buds +. In all honesty, I really wanted to try the new 2020 Google earbuds, but they kept stringing a release date along and I needed something better now. Keep in mind for my review: I'm not an audiophile. My $20 pair connected by a cable sound great to me. I was looking for BT earbuds with silicone pieces that seal in the ear that would work on planes and a great mic for business calls on the road. I won't have a good review of bass highs and lows or detailed sound quality. Also, my main use case, I'd say 90% of the time, is with one ear bud in at a time doing work around others so I can listen to news, podcasts, books, or music but still hear my environment around me. Pros:
- Call Quality: This is the main reason I went with the Galaxy Buds + over the others I was considering. I was able to find a couple real world call quality tests and these blew everything out of the water. Even in an airport or cafe I'm able to take a business meeting and the other end hears me loud and clear with minimal background noise. It's just a great call experience. Not a single person has said my quality is bad or I'm too quiet like many other sets I've tried. - Able to use one bud at a time. This was important to me and a lot of other true wireless devices won't do it. - The fit is great. At first I was mad that the typical third-party silicone pieces wont fit in the charging case, but the provided ones fit great and I can wear them all day without discomfort. - Battery life. It's just amazing. I wear my headphones on and off all day. Anywhere from 2-10 hours a day and I'm only charging these every 2-3 days. Gone are the days where I need to remember to plug them in every night or go without the next morning. - Ambient sound mode is amazing. I typically only wear one ear at a time because I need to hear around me, but more and more I'm using them both because with the ambient mode I can listen and also clearly hear whats going on around me. Hell, I can even turn ambient mode up to max and it's like what I would imagine a low grade hearing aid might be like. It takes some getting used to, but once you do, its pretty nice. - Size of the case. One of my major draw backs was no cord connecting them. For years I have used BT buds that connect with a cable and use a clip to keep it attached to me shirt all day. That way I could just press the pause button on the cable and pull it out when not needed and let them hang. It took some getting used to, but carrying that case and taking them in and out all day isn't too much of a change. A benefit of this also is that because I always wore them on my shirt, I was constantly losing the silicon ear pieces, and no more. - Sound. While I'm not an audiophile, I do like music a lot and these are far superior to the $20-$30 pairs I've been using for years. It's not overly important to me because most of my listening is just voice talking, but it's nice. Cons:
- Poor signal. This is the entire reason for my 2 stars off. Like i said, 90% of my use is with one earbud, so it took me a while to figure this out. With both buds connected, the BT signal seems to be split and makes the range very low. So low in fact that with he phone in my pocket the BT signal degrades for a few seconds every few minutes to catch back up. I run 4-5 times a week and that's one of the times I use both ears. I simply can't use these wile running because I use a belt that holds my phone close to my hip an the buds can't get a clear connection. I have 4 other pairs of cheap BT sets, 2 of them literally only $5 backup pairs, and the Galaxy Buds + are the only ones that have this issue. If I run with only one bud in, I don't have any problems. For a set of $150+ Bluetooth set, I should not need to have my phone sitting on a table with clear line of site to use both headsets. I even tried putting my phone in an arm band on my upper arm, but it was still too far away for the earbud across by head. I could stand to lose some weights...but I'm not such a mass that should be blocking a BT signal. This is a very poor design. I intend to contact Samsung to RMA these and I'll update this review if the second pair doesn't have this issue."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Quality and battery life,Best earpods headphones in the market
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Great product for the price,"Great audio quality and noise cancellation all in one sleek case, the only problem is I have larger ears so they do tend to slip out but as is all earphones I’ve purchased. Just wish their was more size options for the gummies"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,0,2020-04-27,Just question,Work with note 8? ?
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Worth every penny,"Wow! I’ve tried several brands ranging from $40 up to $300 and I think I’ve found a winner. The bass isn’t exaggerated, stereo separation is exceptional, and the overall features bundled with this level of sound quality is a very pleasant surprise. I’ll provide an update when I try these with their proprietary sound app."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Great Headphones!,These headphones are fantastic! I had the AirPods before and they just werent that good the battery life like all apple products sucked but these were fantastic I could have them on for hours and hours. Overall a great purchase!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Great sound quality performance is amazing,Please contact me immediately
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Works fine,Works fine
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Works beautifully,Read the review of on this one and I love them so far. My favorite feature is the ambient mode very unique.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,They can hear u when u call using Galaxy buds +,Way better than the Galaxy buds. these sound better and when u call someone they can hear me and not static or a loud noise. if u have the Galaxy buds u need to get the Galaxy buds+. To me they are worth the extra 30 bucks
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,A,Awesome
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-29,love them,much better than the originals.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-14,Good Upgrade from Original Buds,Original buds were good. These are great! Much improved call quality. Music sounds better too with an additional speaker (woofer and tweeter). All day and then some battery life.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Good quality,Doesn't feel like it'll fall out of my ear and is very comfortable.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,iPhone 11 Pro user approved,"iPhone user approves these headphones and in my opinion wayyyy better than the standard AirPods . 👌🏽 Prettier, more discrete, more comfortable less expensive, newer technology. Haven’t tried the AirPods pro but don’t want to bother with those expensive ones when there’s these. LOVE that Samsung gave Apple users more support. You’re able to change around some sound profiles and customize the headset. One of the cool features is the ambient sound which allows you to hear more of yourself and the environment around you. Very useful when you’re out and about shopping yet need to take a call or want to listen to music but still be able to hear people around you. Love this feature. You can toggle it on and off as you need
I did have the older versions and can confirm that these are louder and have better call quality. Everyone can hear me clearly and perfectly during long calls. I will update this review if anything goes wrong but I don’t foresee it . They are seriously so pretty love the little glimmery touch pad, reminds me of an opal."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,Worth the upgrade!,"Starting from the surface, I love the new glossy look on the case and buds themselves. With the case, the hinge inside it is improved as it is smoother and more satisfying when opening/closing the case. Battery life and sound is superb. Richer sound due to to the enhanced woofer & tweeter. Overall worth the upgrade from the first generation Galaxy Buds!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,The sound,Nice quality
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,awesome,amazing..the ambient sound is crazy..LOVE THEM! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-17,A Fantastic Value; Made Even More Fantastic.,"Brief summary:
The Galaxy Buds+ are a very decent set of truly wireless earbuds, and great successor to the original Galaxy Buds. They are lightweight, comfortable, have a long battery life, and the sound quality is more than sufficient enough for enjoying music on the go. They also cancel out a decent amount of noise despite the fact that there is no Active Noise Cancellation. There is also great synergy between devices, especially Samsung devices, if you own them. Whether you're on iOS or Android, these are a better choice compared to the other offers in this price point, and even beyond. (Yes, even AirPods)."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,My search has ended!,"I've been searching for quality earbuds with all of the features I want and I've finally found them in the Galaxy Buds+. I poured over page after page of wireless earbuds on Amazon, reading specs and watching Youtube video reviews. I was about to purchase the Mifo 07 earbuds when my woman told me about the Galaxy Buds+ that just came out so I decided to check it out. Although I preferred the look of the Mifo 07 and its compactness, the Galaxy Buds+ won me over with its single charge battery life and ambient mode. I like the fact that you can customize what the touchpad does in the Galaxy Wear app. It also has different EQ options. The buds will also start the music when you put them in your ear and pause when you take them out. A feature I didn't know about. They also have seamless switching from single to dual buds with no music interruption which is another feature I was looking for. The ""find my earbuds"" feature is a nice touch and something I haven't seen with other earbuds. You activate it from the app and the earbuds will chirp like a baby bird so you can find them. lol Oh and they also sound great with the 2-way speakers. I have my volume controls set to double tap on the earbud edge which frees up the center touchpad for other functions. The only thing I don't like is how slippery they are. You kind of have to fumble around to dig them out of your ears. lol Not a deal breaker though. Overall, I'm very happy with them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-18,horrible bass,I am sending these back. The bass was horrible and so was the volume. My four year old Jaybird X2's sound 100 times better. Maybe I got a defective pair since mostly all other reviews say the sound is great.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,First Pair of Wireless Buds,"These things have awesome battery life. The sound quality is great wish they could possibly get a little bit louder but that's really my only complaint so far. They fit really nice and the spotify compatibility is great. Would definitely recommend these. EDIT: So I figured out that if you select change earbud volume for the touch settings in the samsung wearable app, you can make them much louder. So basically, I have no flaws to mention in the review anymore."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-19,Beats the old buds in all areas except the case itself (for trivial reasons),"So far I am very pleased with these updated Galaxy Buds. The battery life can't be expressed enough as a virtue of these buds because I can finally use them through an entire workday without needing to recharge. They could have sounded like tin cans as long as the battery life met my expectations. But I'm pleased to report these do not in fact sound like tin cans, but instead very rich and full sound without distortion or lag when streaming video. I am not much of an audiophile but I am a music lover and I do not discriminate too heavily when judging wireless earbuds because the main bonus for having wireless buds is being able to listen as long as possible without fatiguing the ear or running out of power before the listener is done listening as well as not getting wrapped up in a cable when you get up from your desk to file some paperwork or refill your coffee cup. And I am pleased to say that these check all of the above boxes and more. They remain as comfortable as the old Galaxy Buds, and come with more adjust-ability in the form of different sized wing tips and ear tips. For myself the factory installed tips worked well for me but your mileage may vary. And the case is fairly good at it's job especially with the added left/right earpiece battery indicator inside. The only area the case is at fault, in my opinion, is that Samsung decided to go for a glossy appearance and frankly, for something that is to be handled daily, it would have been ideal if they had kept the soft texture of the past Galaxy Buds case to avoid pesky fingerprints being so boldly visible. But with this being my only real gripe, I would say this set has been worth the cost. One addition I'd like to speak about is the reported lack of bass from other reviews here. I have the original Galaxy Buds and now these Galaxy Buds+ and I can tell you with the unit I received the Bass is indeed improved over the original buds. I played a bass heavy track over and over using each pair of earbuds individually to confirm the improvement. So perhaps other users had a defective unit or they have unrealistic expectations for the amount of bass tiny earbuds can provide before distorting. It's not going to feel like you have fully enclosed headphones and 40mm drivers. So expecting that type of performance is going to set you up for disappointment."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,Very good product,These are some really good wireless earphones
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,I love them!,Great sound and comfortable.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,Best purchase I've made in several years,"I bought the Buds a few weeks ago. The buds were cool, but I wasn't impressed. I returned the Buds and decided to try out the Buds+ after reading some reviews online. The Buds+ are honestly the best purchase I've made in years. Here are a few things that have made the Buds+ insanely awesome:
1. The ambient sound level can be adjusted, and it's much better compared to Buds. Now I can keep ambient song on and hear conversations clearly while listening to music; it's like having my own soundtrack to life. 2. The Buds+ ambient mode is insanely sensitive. There is a Beta test option (under ""Labs"") to have 'Extra Loud' ambient sound. I tried it out in downtown Baltimore, and thought I was hearing a little static. I paused my music and looked around. The static was actually the sound a gentleman emptying his bladder--all the way from the alley across the street! I've never been so shocked, amazed, and repulsed all at once. 3. I let 4 colleagues (3 iPhone owners) try out the Buds+. Three of them (2 iPhone owners) have since ordered a pair. Two offered to buy them from me on the spot. And in case you didn't know, the Buds+ are iPhone compatible! 4. The white Buds+ look fly as hell. 5. The battery life gives a combined 22 hours of play time (11 hours in the earbuds and 11 hours of charge in the case). I only have to plug them in every other day! Basically, you'll never want to take these out. With every other earbud I've tried, I've needed to remove my ear buds to engage with others in-person. The Buds+ eliminate this drawback and allow you to fully integrate a piece of hardware into your life, and facilitate hands free use of your digital assistant. TLDR; Get these now!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-21,THESE ARE A MAJOR GO!,"Using Flossy Carter's ranking system on a scale of 1-10 these are a triple major go. The battery on these is no joke with 11 hours on the buds alone and 22 hours with the case. Also, call quality on these are great with everything sounding clear you should have no problems taking a call with these and with ambient sound you could listen to music and still here what's going on around you which is great. Now, this could vary from person to person but for me these are comfortable which is perfect for long listening sessions but your mileage may vary. All in all these are great buds for the price and would highly recommend."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Recommend,I would go for these versus the previous Samsung Galaxy buds tbh.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Ain't no joke,I'm pretty sure y'all have watched videos about these but it's legit
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,A great set of Buds for the price,"I bought them for the improved ambient mode and I was not disappointing. They are the best buds for that and I own some Buds that cost alot more. the music sound has improved because of the 2 drivers instead of one. I own both gen of Galaxy buds and am very happy with them all. BTW, I also go back to the IconX, so I have been there for all the Gens."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Very solid ear buds.,"Samsung Galaxy buds plus improved battery life significantly from am original buds, and easier to connect, shows battery indicator on the case as well , more fuller sound, and better than iPods."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-24,I got wrong type,I order galaxy bud +... It's coming the first generation..
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-25,best earbuds tried to date,great all rounder
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-25,Unreliable!! Do better Samsung!,"UPDATE: Now both cut out. The new ones came. Lets hope they're not dud buds. ORIGINAL: They sound great....when they work. I've only had them a few days, and the left side bud already cuts out frequently. I can get it to come back if I reset them. I shouldn't have to fuss with them to get one to work. Theyre going back"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-25,BAAMMMM!!,"These are waaayyy better than the previous models (Galaxy Buds 1)....the ambience is nice...I can hear people talking while music is playing...as long as the music's not too loud, you can converse with people around you...and I can hear people about 15ft away from me in a different room talking...can't understand what they're exactly saying but, I know there are people in the other room talking...pretty cool....you can still hear yourself as a muffled internal voice, but you can also hear what you are saying via the extra mic they put in this model of Bud+...pretty cool....I gave my AirPods PRo to the wife, she's on the iPhone and I moved to the Note 10+. Overall, very happy with this purchase....easily worth 150$!! They're the same build as previous, nothing changed physically, however, the touch pad is more pearl like finish. The life of the battery is what ultimately sold me on these as they're supposed to have 11 hrs of use...I haven't got that far with them cause I only received them today...."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-26,Their just plain great!,Their great. Connection with Note 9 perfect. Automatically reconnects when you get in range and they will bring up your last song or playlist. Kinda neat...definitely try the different ear ends to get a good fit for each ear.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-26,Awesome,Awesome buds +
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-27,Fantastic earbuds,"The most comfortable earbuds I've used, and the battery life and short charging times are great."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-28,Best,Best
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,A Must Buy,A much better improvement from the last galaxy buds. More listening time due to improved battery life.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-01,So Much Tech In Such a Small Package,"I've been skeptical about true wireless earbuds for a long time now. They are so wildly expensive for something that only works for 4-6 hours average. The sound quality is mediocre on most brands due to the wireless and I totally understand that you are giving up certain things for the true wireless capability. Then in steps the Buds Plus. These little ear pieces are amazing. 11 hours of battery life without a charge and, let's face it, if they're not in your ear, they're charging in the case. So that keeps them going strong all day. The sound quality is pretty great compared to other brands I've tested, especially when you use the Equalizer on the Samsung Wearables app. The ambient noise feature is great for when there are people around and you don't want to take the earpiece out. Just simply pause your music and its basically like nothings there. People have even commented on how well they can hear me during a phone call which makes these perfect for work. All around, I can't say they're perfect. But dang do these come pretty close."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Good,First set cane bricked. Replacements are great
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-02,Best battery life of any buds I've tried(which is a ton),"Put them in my ears at 830am and listened to YouTube non stop while working..left the jobsite at 7PM and still had almost 30% left. That's top notch.sound is good just not as good as my Jabra 75t actives,but is definitely acceptable"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,Worth every penny,"I don't normally write reviews however this was worth it. I was worried that I was spending too much since they offer a cheaper model, but I am telling you, you won't regret it! They are worth every penny. The sound quality, ease of operating, the seamless app that you use with it. If you are questioning the price don't its definitely an investment you won't regret!! !"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-03,pretty good,much better than the regular buds . in comparison to the airport pro? they beat it in quality sound and bass and haptics but not noise canceling
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-04,Good,Good
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,First true wireless earbuds... And amazing,"I am absolutely impressed with these earbuds. My favorite things about them are the first factor...I totally forget they are there, even with a winter hat on over them, super light and fit perfectly in my ear. I am also really impressed with the ambient noise feature. Perfect for better having to take these out to interact with anyone I need to. And finally, the battery life is crazy awesome. The sound quality is good, not as much base as I would like (even on the dynamic preset), but I'm using these as my daily commuter/work set and don't really need it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,Better than Apple pro in everyway,These are amazing and sound 10 times better than my apple pro.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-11,Fitting,I really like the Samsung buds but one thing I dont like is the fitting..they always manage to fall out from my ears..even after I put the different sizers
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-12,One side died,Haven't had them for a month and the right side isnt working well anymore. The sound is like a whisper. Before that they were perfect.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-12,Mediocre sound...lack strong appeal,"Excellent fitting. But Still lacking in bass, devoid of the richness in sound typical of headphone within the same price range.."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-14,Great battery life. Good features. VERY low volume and so so music sound quality.,Great battery life. Good features. VERY low volume and so so music sound quality. No matter what I did I couldn't get these things moderately loud enough. If I plug in my V-Moda I can't go above 50% without damaging my ears. With the Galaxy Buds + with every maxxed out it wasn't loud enough to hear all the detail and I don't listen to blasting loud music. Returning to try the Sony's.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-15,true all day battery life!,"as someone whos had a ton of cheaper wireless buds, these are worth every cent! where others id have to stop after 3 or 4 hours for a charge, these truly do go all day. ive got over 11 hours on them before listening at around 70% volume which is all you really need considering how loud they get. i mostly listen to podcasts. but the touch and hold to turn on ambient sound is amazing so i dont need to pull them out if i see someone i want to speak with. fit is great. they look great. and the case is small enough to be pocket friendly. 11/10 recommend"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-15,Best buds ever,I've had apple air pods. I changed to Samsung and I liked my buds. But these Samsung buds plus are SOOOOOO much better than the originals. It's not even comparable.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,Great for galaxy users,"I was debating between this and airpod, but decided to get these as I am an android user. My decision was great. The sound quality is great and they don't fall out even when I'm jogging."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-18,Case not working,I have had the headphones for a couple of weeks and the case will not charge the headphones anymore.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,Best Headphones Around,Some of the best headphones on the market. Works great on iOS and Android. Definitely worth the price especially compared to competitors.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,🤩,🥰
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Can't go wrong with these!,A great step up from regular galaxy buds. Nice sound and call quality.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Great !,"Got these for my little brothers birthday, he loves these earbuds he was very pleased that they came in white as well"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-22,To answer phone calls,It is hard to answer phone calls I don't like that. The sound is very clear.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-25,Best Buds for Best Price!!,"Best buds ever, especially if you have Samsung Phone...
Great sound, with soft cancellation of noise and yet can still hear my toddler asking me questions"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-26,Meh. Disappointed.,Amazing until right bud went out within 5 weeks of getting them... for 150 dollars I expected better.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,Great Product,This the the best purchase I have made in years. Hands down the beat wireless earphones out there!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-31,The battery life of the Charging case runs out quickly,"I concur with other reviewers that the earphones themselves are outstanding with sound and, while without any electronic form of noise reduction, allows for a sealed/noise-free listening pleasure, controllable by software for outstanding sound. One thing that makes me feel uncomfortable about the earphones is the charging case. For some reason, the case runs out of charge quite quickly. I wonder how much power the case should be able to charge the earphones. Thanks"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-31,Comfort>volume,"This is a comparison of my wife’s & i’s: Powerbeats 2, taotronics 72 something’s, echo buds, & Soundcore liberty pros. Galaxy buds overall pretty good. Little overpriced I feel. Not very loud, but what volume there is, seems pretty good. No prob connecting to galaxy s7, windows 10 pc, iPads ect. Can’t use Alexa app on phone so that’s a bummer. Would of liked to be able to hands free, say call wife. But have to open Alexa app, & even then didn’t really understand what I was wanting. Lots of wind noise when anc is on. I typically don’t use so no biggie. Great fit &finish. Distance is trypical crappy Bluetooth, about 25ft. Initially bought the libertys cuz of rave reviews of volume. Wanted to like them but found them to be high volume/low quality. As well as being huge. These fit similarly to wife’s echo buds. But Sound better. Bout the same crappy volume. The cheapy taotroncs are as loud or louder. I guess that’s the trade off for earbuds: high volume=larger driver=heavier. Would of bought the echo buds if they were $50 cheaper. 130$ for them is just too much. The touch controls are finicky, seems hard to double tap to skip track. Would of rather spent less on a physical button, but we live in an age of sissies who have overly sensitive fingers, & wants everything with the least amount of physical activity as possible. Bike rides/walking pretty comfortable. Like I said tho with anc activated wind noise is an issue. Wish the bud tips went further into ear. Tho I know a lot of ppl don’t like that. In all, Don’t regret purchase, but a little pricey for what they offer."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-02,Great product. No single replacement earbuds available,"These earbuds+ are great for music listening and especially making phone calls. The mic quality is better than many similar TWS earbuds, It is truly superior. There's one thing to consider though, unlike Apple airpods Samsung does not allow the purchase of a single earbud to replace a lost one. A Samsung rep told me that i would unfortunately have to purchase an entire brand new package."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-03,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I just received these yesterday. First of all shipping was amazingly FAST! I wasn't expecting to receive these until today. They are very easy to connect and when fitted into ear properly they sound amazing! The bass is incredible. When I have them in, no one else can hear what I am listening to either. They stay put nicely. I will be able to walk and exercise with these in which is one of the main reasons that i purchased them. I get up at 4 am to exercise and the rest of my house is still sleeping. I wasn't able to listen to music while exercising before for fear of waking everyone up. I am very happy with this purchase all around!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-04,Call quality is horrible,"Call quality sucks... static, they cant hear me... sounds like a Ro it"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-05,Very Nice Ear Buds. It's a shame they can't make decent refridgerators!,These ear buds are very nice. I was reluctant to buy them because my French Door refrigerator is defective on two fronts - the ice maker and the fridge portions have malfunctioned bi-monthly - and Samsung knows there's a problem with thousands of these products and they still fight the customer.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-05,Love these headphones!,After my past buds got stolen I decided to upgrade to the Buds +. I love them and the improved battery life over the past ones is well worth the upcharge. Great noise cancelling and very comfy to my ears. Would very much recommend!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,Great sound,"Ambient sound is definitely improved, very nice"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,"High quality, user friendly and sound great","These earbuds are fantastic. I reccomend using the dynamic setting on the app. The bass setting loses way too much of the high end. AKG who makes these is a brilliant German company who makes a fine product. If you have a newer Samsung phone the earbus that came with it are AKG, but are there cheapest available which you can purchase foe under $20 and are pretty weak, so don't exrect anything like that because you get every bit of what you pay for. The touch pads are also very nice. The build quality is great. Charging is quick and convenient with a wireless QI pad. I also bought a the case cover that has the chrome trim and a keychain clip which I attach to my belt loop and can still put the case in my pocket knowing I will now lose them. The QI pad charges through the added case. I have had other brands and these are the best wireless I have had."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,IN-CREDIBLEEEEEEE!!!!!!,"These buds + are seriously amazing. The stuff you can do with them is awesome. The sound, at first, was a little disappointing. But then I realized I didn't have a tight seal with the size eartips that come installed on the buds. I switched them out for a size bigger and instantly the buds came to life. The noise cancelling is top notch for when you want to escape your surroundings. And when you need to be able to hear your surroundings, turn the ""ambient sound"" on to 1 of the 3 levels and you'll be able to hear cars coming from behind you if out exercising, or even be able to hear things at a magnified level if you put the ambient on the highest setting. I highly recommend and don't know why anybody would waste money on anything else (cheaper earbuds OR ones that are more money)."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-06,"It's not worth 150,","I own both version, and to me there no big difference in sound, only a bit clear but not was I was expecting cause the first version sound good to me. Battery life itg amazing I can go up to 3 days without charging(6 to7 hrs a day)
Noise cancellation I dont use this feature but it does drain you battery quickly, and the microphone works really really! good,"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-08,"Great, except for one thing","I was debating between buying these or AirPod Pros. In a side-by-side comparison between the two, the sound quality is very on par with one another. I love using the Dynamic and Bass Boost settings on these. I also enjoy the touch pad. The battery life is excellent. The audio is also great with calls. I love the variety of ambient settings, but my ONLY complaint is that if you’re outside, ambient is very sensitive to any wind, and it’s really annoying. Overall, I would recommend these, especially since they’re less costly than the Pros."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-14,Good sound quality but hurt my ears with 1h+ wearing,"Elegant look, good sound quality, but it weights just a bit too much and hurts my ears"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-14,Bad sound,I didn't give these much of a chance after discovering the sound quality was so poor. I would never buy these for use in any environment other than a manufacturing plant or other similarly noisy place. And then I would not expect to hear very good music.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-15,Great,Great quality product. I recommend the plus over the regular ones.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-15,Don't even waste your time/money,"The right headphone never connected. I've done multiple things (as recommended) to fix the issue and nothing worked. I reset my phone, deleted the Galaxy Wearable app and re downloaded it, disconnected and connected the headphones countless times. Let the batteries drain and try to recharge them hoping it would work. NOTHING. I tried to contact the seller and no reply. I contacted a Samsung representative they said ""go to a repair center"" FOR A BRAND NEW SET OF HEADPHONES FRESH OUT OF THE BOX? I shouldn't have to get something repaired that's brand new. Really disappointing that I paid $140 for one working headphone. Amazing."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,LOVE THEM CAN WEAR ALL DAY,I previously had the 2017 Gear IconX and I rode those til the wheels fell off so this was a welcome upgrade. Great sound and even better battery life only miss the on board storage for music when not connected to phone.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-17,Awesome buds,I haven't had any trouble with these. They are like hearing aids and I can use them to hear far away sounds.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Noice,👌
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Battery life and clear sound +++,"Apple device user, and I am so pleased with these. -Pairing is strong and only sometimes unpairs when I call over skype or something VOIP. Has never unpaired on the phone or with music/podcasts. Can jump between pairing with my phone and macbook easily. -Battery life is no joke, lasts 10 hours using them straight through the day, case has a full charge + more when fully charged
-love the wireless fast charging, only takes a couple hours to fully charge an empty case
-no active noise cancelling but I can listen to music and podcasts and it really blocks out the noise of 2 roommates, a dog and a roomba, so i'm happy with it. -sound is clear and crisp, with plenty of bass
-price tag beats airpod pro by about $100
-comfortable and stay secure in my ears whether at my desk or working out/running
-multiple beautiful colors, intuitive in ear controls allow me to play/pause, answer calls, go forward a song, go backward a song without accidentally hanging up on someone
highly recommend for a fantastic all-purpose set of TWE that won't give you buyer's remorse"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,yes samsung!!!!,Samsung never cease to amaze me!! Hesvy dsmdung fan here and these bud are everything!!! Noise cancelation is on point no surrounding sound i hear at all to silence!! I love that!!! Buds well worth the money! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,The best buds,"Great product, excellent sound quality."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-21,Right earbud Not working !!!!,"as far as fit and sound quality out of box the left bud it was good. long battery life is convenient however the right bud failed to even turn on. You think with a brand like Samsung this shouldn't happen but I realized that this is a common issue with these earbuds. I tested them with three different phones and a laptop and no sign of life what so ever...
seller was nice. they sent the return label and refunded my money but they did that after receiving the returned product which meant I had to delay buying replacement till I get my money back."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-23,Issues started after 2 weeks of use...,"I loved them in the first 2 weeks!!!. After 2 weeks, they started losing connection to my phone, muffle sound and make me hear robots and people were not able to hear me well very frequently. The left battery started to drain much quicker than the right one and I need to charge them more frequently. The ambiant sound feature is super cool, but sometimes you hear the air passing by, specially after I upgraded their software. I was super happy with them the first 2 weeks, and I accepted the fact that they do not have noise cancelling feature, but the fact it is not allowing me to make quality calls is not okay :("
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Awesome Exactly What I Wanted,I love them completely... I dont think there is anything I would change... even has a locate feature incase you lose them...
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-24,Good all around ear buds,"Good sound for ear buds with nice highs and mids, but not going to give you the sound quality that a good set of headphones will. Microphone works well. Comfortable fit. Plenty of features. Battery life for case could be a little better. Build quality is good, but too early to tell on longevity."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,So far very happy with purchase,So far so good. Got tired of the wires. These sound great (not awesome but still great) and have quite a few nice features. Needed to use the smallest ear pieces. I've found dynamic with a customized equilizer created best overall sound quality. The ambiet sound option is a major benefit.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,amazinf,love it
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Buen Artículo,En mi caso puedo decir que son un excelente artículo; Sólo que después de usarlo un rato me molesta traerlos
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Very pleased,"I already had a pair from the store when I got the Galaxy Note 10+. I was worried these would not be up to par. They certainly were. They are just like the ones I received at the store and the quality is great. Also, I received them within two days without prime."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,I love them,They work great I'm satisfied
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Battery life is outstanding!,"I work in a REALLY small office where I can occasionally overhear my co-workers, and when it is frequently eerily quite. In order to deal with both of those issues, I was using a pair of cheap wireless earbuds from Amazon. They did the job, but the battery life was about 3 hours, which worked, because I'm only allowed to wear 1 at a time, but it wasn't ideal when I wanted to use both buds on the weekends, etc. Additionally, the call quality was non existent. I chose these because I use a Samsung phone and they had good reviews. I could not be happier with my purchase. The longest I've used a bud so far is 8.5 hours, and it still had more than 50% batter remaining when I returned it to the case at the end of my work day. The call quality is just as good. I can make/receive calls with just one bud and have no trouble hearing, nor do the people on the other end. The app for the buds that you download to your phone allows you to turn on/off ambient noise, which is great when I'm wearing both buds while walking my dogs. I feel so much safer that I can still hear the world around me while also having great sound quality for my music. You can even customize the level of the ambient sound, depending on your preferences. I'd highly recommend these buds to anyone!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Give Apple a run for their money,"As someone who sold their soul to Apple, I am THOROUGHLY impressed with these bad boys. Wasn’t ready to put down 250 for some AirPods, so I figured I give these a try. First and foremost, they work with my IPhone, no problem. They also stay in your ear really well! Which is one of my biggest issues - even when running and sweating a lot. Secondly they have pretty solid sound quality. Not up to par with Bose, but I’ve tried AirPod pros out before and I think it’s better then them. Noise canceling is solid. Charge time is great - can listen to them through almost whole day of work. Really happy with this purchase. Highly recommend."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-28,Letdown,"I was excited to try these wireless buds due to all the positive reviews but once receiving them myself I was pretty disappointed. For the price the sound quality was mediocre and below average to what I was used to. The touch commands on the buds weren't intuitive. Worst part was that the buds weren't comfortable, especially laying down hurt me ears more than they should've. I love Samsung but they have yet to perfect the wireless earbuds, past generations and models were also disappointing unfortunately"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-14,SHREK,"I think shrek is a very adequate movie and i think that you should watch this movie if you are over the age of consent. edit - the earbuds are just about as good as shrek...
The earbuds in the 2nd photo have the new rubber on the inside of the case to prevent the scratching as seen on the old earbuds case. Ps. that should be the new display photo for the buds lol"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-14,Good battery sound and call quality,Amazing battery and sound
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Battery life on these are a game changer!!! True all day battery life tested.,"Charged them up and used them all day till the evening and I gotta say I am so impressed with the battery life of these earbuds. From 9am to 6pm on a full charge using MAX Volume settings, I still had 10% left which is really good compared to all the other Bluetooth earbuds out there, the 11 hours that Samsung advertises is with the volume at 50%. These Earbuds do not have noise cancelling but with that $150 price tag compared to all the other high $$$ earbuds that do, it’s a good trade off in price point for the consumer that’s not looking to spend over $200 for some quality wireless earbuds. The Ambient Sound feature is great when you need be alert of your surroundings when using both earbuds. I’m using these with my iPhone XR and I downloaded the Galaxy earbuds plus app to customize the settings and features and sound settings within the buds pretty easily. The Sound is great!! When I’m blasting them on full volume with the ambient sound feature turns off I don’t hear anything else around me other than what’s streaming from my phone. I have the AirPod Pros and They sound a little better and the noise cancelling is great but is it $100 more great??? IMO no, and where I see the value of these Galaxy buds + over the AirPod Pros is definitely in that Battery life. So it really all comes down to what you value more out of daily use of your earbuds, the AirPod pros can never get me through my workday continuously without having to recharge them every 3-4 but the galaxy buds got me through 9 HOURS continuously and I still had juice left at the end of my workday which is unheard of Bluetooth headset. If you want to maximize even more battery life, just use one earbud for 8-11 hours straight and when it runs out switch earbuds and get another 8-11 hours while the other bud is charging. To me the Battery life is a game changer and Samsung has just set the standard of what’s possible out of tiny earbud batteries. They have switched me as a daily airpod user to a galaxy bud plus supporter but Android still has a long way to go compared to iOS on the iPhone side of things."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Excellent sound and features-Cloud Blue color is nice,"I have the original Samsung Buds and have 2 phones ;Samsung UI Android and Apple IOS so the new feature of multiple Bluetooth pairings is nice but clumsy.I get into that near bottom of review but this only means pairing ,you can not use these buds on 2 devices at the same time.The fit is exactly the same as the original buds and does a great job for me with passive noise reducing.ANC is earbuds is a bit overrated because your ear is exposed to sounds and there is only so much that will help.Over the ear ANC works ,I tested some buds and it barely makes a difference and could give you a headache. The overall sound is a big improvement over the original buds and the low end fits up the sound range.Not super bass but a definite improvement overall.The ambient microphone settings are a big improvement.The medium setting is more than enough to hear people talk and the high and sound labs-extra high are like hearing aids.You could hear people talk 20 feet away easily,kinda scary.The battery life is more on the 8-9 hours if you are listening to music all the time.Going down to 11 hours would probably zero out the battery and you wouldn’t want to do that.The new app (the iOS is in my pictures) for the Buds on iOS copies any Sound Lab settings you have set up on the Samsung wearable but you can’t change them just on iOS.I also noticed less difference between Dynamic,treble,bass etc on the iOS app vs. Samsung Wearable.Switching involves disconnecting from one device and connecting to the other.It is easy to disconnect on the Samsung but on the iOS you have to open Bluetooth settings.Now if you are only using one device,the buds automatically connect and disconnect so that isn’t a problem.The buds do want to connect to a Samsung device after starting,but if you are switching it is much easier than before.The touchpad tap options all work ,Spotify has to be open or with a last track playing.Just tapping Spotify didn’t wake the app for me.The Labs double tap for volume on it side works but you really have to hit the edge,too close to the middle and the other function will work (play next track)Call quality is fairly good ,if you are in a crowded place or near loud noises the person you are talking to will hear some of the sounds but not too bad. I like the case feel even through it is shiny,the lid now has a smooth feel and better snap at closing.Overall I highly recommend these to anyone with a Samsung device,these are excellent for the price point.I recommend upgrading if you are a fan of music or use more than one phone regularly.I really recommend the Cloud Blue,nice color and blends with fairer skin people better than white in my opinion."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Great earbuds all around!!!,I received the Galaxy buds+ today and I connected them to my iPhone XS Max. So far my experience with these buds are great! Connecting them was simple thanks to the galaxy buds+ app. Glad it could be installed on my iPhone. I do like AirPods other than them falling out of my ears from time to time. I couldn’t afford the AirPods pro at this time that’s why I purchased these buds. Therefore I can’t give you a comparison of the pros and the buds plus. They do in my opinion sound better than the regular AirPods. I’m impressed with the sound quality and from what they say about the battery life I won’t be complaining about that either. They fit amazingly in my ears and I don’t have to worry about them falling out. I’m glad I purchased these and they will be my earbuds of choice for awhile. Eventually I will purchase AirPod Pro but for now I’m quite satisfied. I hope your experience with these buds are as good as mine. The call quality is also great!! No complaints from me. Hope you all will have a great experience too. I say go for it if you haven’t already! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Great buds if you're in the market for some,"I will preface by saying that I have been in the market for some 'Truly Wireless' Earbuds for the past few months. I went through the Jabra Elite 75t, to the Jaybird Vista to these. If you're like me, you want some earbuds you can pop in and forget. I wanted to strike a balance between audio and functionality as I do enjoy exercising without wires. While the review feels a bit rushed, I can give a first impression of the Samsung Galaxy buds+ compared to my previous choices. I will keep the alternatives succinct listing only the features that I find noteworthy when comparing. Any features not mentioned were lackluster or not worth mentioning. Jabra Elite 75t:
-Battery Life, 7.5 Hours, 28 hours total
-Pass through audio
-Great for exercising
Jaybird Vista:
-ipx7 rating(Waterproof)
-Better balanced audio than Jabra(Jabra audio is overwhelmingly bassy and muddy)
-Community EQs
Galaxy Buds+:
-Hear through superior to Jabra(Loud hissing on Jabra)
-Best sound quality out of the 3(I love clean bass, pronounced mids and crisp highs)
-Battery Life, 11 hour super single charge, 22 hours total
Overall First Impression:
These are my first pair of buds from the Samsung family. I can immediately attest to the Samsung user experience being snappy and responsive. I opened my case and immediately my phone notified me that I had buds to pair which was pleasant. I love the audio on the buds. They feel clean, the mids are vibrant and the highs really soar, the bass feels clean and controlled. My only gripe with these so far is that they don't stay in as well as the Vistas or Jabras, but those buds are designed to stay in really well. The wing tips on the Buds are not bad, don't get me wrong, they are solid, but they will not hold for intense exercise. All in all, I don't get that sinking feeling of regret that I got with the Jabras. While I am content with the Vistas, the Buds+ are a no brainer. Especially at this price point. Very glad with my purchase for now."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,I loved how they are rounded and have that shiny color. Looks and sounds great,"I just got it today so I have to see if I still like them after using them for awhile. But so far they are so comfy, cute, and good sound. I was afraid it wouldn't be loud enough but I put it on Dynamic setting and that was best for me. I paid more for the cloud blue color and glad I did. It's so shiny and looks sweet in my ears. I hope the battery will last a long time, and still charges good after a long time. Thank you for sending it in good condition"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-15,Definitely not worth the price,"So for the price of basically $150.00 you get tinny mono sounding ear buds which have great tech inputs, but even using the app + choosing dynamic equalizer, these are still like 15-25 sounding ear buds. These earbuds are preset to prioritize: 1. Treble -> 2. Bass -> 3. Mids (instrumentals). The treble is quite nice, the voices are very distinct, but the bass is a bit muted, and has no feeling or soul to it - and then the mids - wow. It doesn't even exist! It's very very drowned out. There is a reason why bass heavy earbuds are so popular - they make you feel. These are very purist, but true purist earbuds would be something like: 1. Treble -> 2. Mids -> 3. Bass
So they fail at that too. But the biggest upset for me is the mono sound. It doesn't feel like stereo L and R at all."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-15,Very Satisfying def Recommend!,"I own the previous version of the Galaxy Buds and also own the Airpods Pro. I wanted to give this a shot and so far, it is so good! When I started using the first gen Galaxy Buds, it started off wack with so many connection issues, but that wasn't the case with this. Adjusting the bass, it sounds just as good as the Airpods Pro and worth the price. I recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to spend $250 on a pair of headphones."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-16,Phone sound quality is the best that it could be.,"I could not turn out sound coming from quite talking in the next room.No noise reduction on my 1 day old earphones plus.I heard no base sound unless i held the earbuds hard against my ears.Battery life is very good. Samsung earbuds plus was delivered the same day i ordered them.Amazon said i could return them for refund. Maybe I could find a better fitting tip to the earplugs.The earplug felt like they would not fall off.Volume of sound
from my Galaxy s9 phone was very high and music was very clear and no interruptions thru my ear bud. I recommend the new Samsung plus over my apple pros."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,A true upgrade from last years galaxy buds,"Definitely an upgrade from last year's galaxy buds, better sound quality, more features and longer lasting battery! Great purchase. 10/10 would reccomend for its price. :)"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,GREAT upgrade!,"I bought these at best buy since I had a discount with them($20 off). Great upgrade from the originals, sounds much better during calls and battery lasts waaaaaaaay longer. I recommend. And to the moron giving them a 1 star rating for cancer? Living inside your house gives you cancer. Stepping out of your house gives you cancer. Literally everything gives you cancer. I hope you catch cancer soon with your unhelpful hater based ""review""."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,Fantastic for the price,"Excellent sound, decent fit, extremely easy to use with galaxy phones, ambient noise feature works surprisingly well wthout compromising too much music quality"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-16,Beautifully made,"So I am new to ear buds. I have never tried the previous version so this is something new for me. I recently started a job where they do not allow you to make and receive calls on your cell, so I needed something that would be discreet should I get a call from my husband who is a trucker or from my son's school. These work perfectly. The sound quality is excellent. I have used it for music which is nice and crisp and clear. And I have made calls. Both sound great, and when I asked the person on the receiving end of thr call how the quality was being that the mics are in the buds themselves, they said call quality was great, that they never would have noticed it was from an ear bud. These are nicely packaged and discreet. I love that you can put them in their little container and just throw them in your pocket or purse, makes taking them from place to place super easy. The 11 hours of battery life is wonderful for a 9 hour day at work. I'm also considering getting a set for my husband while he drives, because with the ambient sound controls you do not have to worry about the buds cancelling any outside noise, while maintaining clear sound via music and calls. They fit great with the standard rings on them in my ears, but if they didnt work for you, they come with 2 other sizes. I got the cloud blue and it's a really pale blue with an iridescent sheen to it. Very pretty. They charge super fast, the case charges fast also and the touch pads on them are very responsive. Cons: while you can receive calls via the buds themselves, you can not make calls with them without pressing call from your phone, if there is a way to do this it is not in the manual. Also I was under the impression that you could receive notifications via these buds, yes you do get your notifications but unfortunately it does not tell you who they are from or what they say, whether that's my ignorance or not, these will not work for everything I was hoping they would work for."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,Awesome upgrade,"Awesome upgrade. Sounds better. Mics clearer, battery lasts way longer."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,MUCH better than my Airpods Pros,"These fit better (meaning they are way more comfortable, and they will not slip out like my airpod pros do). The music, podcasts and YouTube videos all sound rich and brilliant (use the Dynamic setting in the app). Passthrough sound works a million times better, which is extremely useful since earbuds dampen sound around you naturally... Which is why i don't miss the active noise cancelling at all. Here's the major thing, I can go the entire work day off one charge! I grew tired of the 4 hour limit before having to charge my pros... So now they can sit the hell down somewhere."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-16,"Excellent battery life, outstanding fit/comfort, great sound!","Much improvement from the original galaxy buds. Great call quality, great overall sound, excellent fit/comfort, does not fall out of ears even when running. Outstanding battery life, last more than a whole work day(11 hours). Plus they charge really fast, Love the touchpad options, gives more flexibility. Waited 2 months to order these instead of the orginal ones and it was worth the wait. Pre ordered mines asap upon realse."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-16,good sound quality,"good sound quality did not fall off when working out not heavy at all very light, and compatible with most of my music apps very happy with this purchase."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-17,The best you can get.,The are definitely the best truly wireless earbuds you can buy. I've had the airpods pro and many others but Galaxy buds plus beat anything else out there. Nearly perfect.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,"Great sound, great price.",These sound great and are worth buying.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-17,Love them,Wonderful
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-02-17,Disappointed,Will be returning these. On a full charge I listen to music from 8:20 am to 11am then disconnect it from my phone. Left it out the case because it was 83%. Then use it from 7:30 pm to 11pm with 2.5 hours if talking and the rest is music and just having it connected and it needed charging because it was dead.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-17,Outstanding improvements - voice quality A+ and sound quality is better than AIrpods Pro imo,I was do disappointed in the originals after moving from Iphone to Samsung this past year. I couldn't believe as a business professional how bad the voice quality was. Thoroughly impressed with these. I am going to convince my Apple friends to get these instead of the pros (they probably won't listen).
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,Great update to an already excellent product,"I love these earbuds. Having used the last gen Samsung Galaxy Buds, the increased battery capacity is a significant bonus as well as the additional mic's and the better ambient noise sensor/settings. BE CAREFUL WITH THE AMBIENT NOISE SETTING! WHEN ACTIVE, IF YOU REMOVE AN EARBUD IT WILL MAKE A HIGH PITCHED SQUEALING."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,Beautiful color,"The AKG earbuds that come with the s10's they never stay inside my right ear. So I was worried about if these would stay in my ear but wearing then around they did. They sound great and in the settings I added the bass boost which sounds so beautiful to my metal music. I really love these, yet I haven't tested the phone call yet although I'm sure the buds are still great."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-18,Great earbuds!,I bought these as a gift but the person likes them alot so far.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,One earbud drains battery power much faster than the other,"I'm uncertain as to why at this point, but my early use of this has exposed that my right earbud burns battery much more slowly than the left earbud. I'm trying to figure out if this is a normal thing or this is a defect. Anyone with ideas about this?"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,0,2020-02-19,Good product but customer support and app are horrifically bad,"Customer support: I couldn't get my buds to pair on Windows. I used the online chat and was redirected to a support team that was supposedly specifically for the Buds+. First CS rep was having multiple conversations and pasted an answer to another customer into my chat. He told me completely useless and unrelated instructions originally, and then send me a link to pairing instructions last iteration of buds (not the Buds+). After I informed him that I followed the steps, the chat went dead for 5 minutes. I asked if he was still there and didn't get a response for another few so I just disconnected. I called in and went through the automated workflow. It very misleadingly tells you that you can additionally be sent an external repair center location, which actually just disconnects your call (instead of just sending you the location in parallel). It tries to disconnect you again a second time by asking you to get support through text. When I finally reached support, I was redirected to another line that is supposedly specifically for the Buds+. The person on the line was very nice, but told me Windows was not supported (it is in fact supported! I got it to pair like any normal Bluetooth hardware on both Windows and Mac...I had a hardware issue I wasn't able to diagnose until I got to test pairing on another machine). I explicitly followed up and asked...so it's not supported on Windows even though it's a Bluetooth device and I was told yes. Overall, the support was so bad, I had to dock the buds two stars because if anything goes wrong with these buds, you're probably screwed. Battery: It's long. I tried to drain it to zero to get an estimate of how long it would last, but I simply could not listen to 11 hours of music in one day. After about 4 hours of listening and a couple of hours of idling outside of the case, I still had about 60% battery left (don't try to extrapolate that, it might not be linear). Sound: I'm not an audiophile and I have only tried 2 other pairs of wireless earbuds made a long time ago (both SoundPEATS). I have an extensive collection of wired buds because I go through them like crazy (I use them every day for both active an inactive activities and often accidentally break) The sound quality (when not using the microphone) blows the other wireless earbuds out of the water and match the audio quality of the best mid-range (~$50) wired buds from Sennheiser, Klipsh, Bose, 1MORE (think CX, S4, Soundsport, etc.). Response is pretty flat (it doesn't feel like they amped up the bass). With the microphone on, the sound quality not amazing (think non-HD phone call). I also have an issue getting the non-hands-free sound to play on Windows when I'm gaming with Discord on (edit: Need to disable the ""Hands-free"" device in both input and output on Windows). Latency is also very noticeable so probably not a good pair for gaming. Apparently, there's another mode that can be set called ""Gaming Mode"" which will supposedly decrease latency, but I haven't tried it because...
Software: ...The mobile app, Galaxy Wearable is horrible. To Samsung's credit, the buds work without Galaxy Wearable. But if you want to use any of the advanced features like audio passthrough or gaming mode, or modify the touch settings, you need to use the app. The problem with the app is it requires way too many permissions. If you deny permissions, the app flat out refuses to run. Why do I need to give calendar permissions to use my earbuds??? It also installs a separate app within the app for the buds, which has completely different permissions scheme and is hard to find in Android because it doesn't appear as its own app.
Comfort: The wingtips are useless for my ears. They aren't long enough. However, the buds themselves have good fit, so I'm not sure the wingtips are needed. I vigorously jumped in place for a bit and they didn't come out. Other: The touch controls are too sensitive, with no option to tweak. I find that I have to take out the buds or adjust the buds in my ears by grasping the side to not accidentally pause anything. Double tapping or long pressing is finnicky at times. You can disable touch controls through the app, which is good."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,"Galaxy buds+ best sounding Ear buds on the market, best with galaxy phones.","I recieved my galaxy buds+ cloud blue today. I ain't expected crazy sounding ear buds. But once I paired them to do a sound test I was blown away, the bass was strong along with the treble and mids was like wise. They sound like the over ear AKG headphones. I have B&O E8 ear buds and I swear the galaxy buds plus blow them out the water far as sound quality and call quality, along with battery life. But be mindful I have a galaxy Note 10 plus phone. So with the Dolby Atmos on really push these ear buds over the top. I'm being honest, these Galaxy buds+ is the best ear buds on the market. I ain't expected this from $150 ear buds. I paid $300 for my B&O E8 and they dont compare. If a person say galaxy buds ain't loud with strong bass and bright Treble. Then they need to order ear wax cleaner."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Amazing before and amazing now,"Galaxy buds+ have amazing sound, build, battery, design, and style!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-19,Hits a homerun in every way. Love them.,Not one con that I can find. Just take your time trying on the different fittments for a perfect seal and seat. These things are amazing. I've had them for 3 hours and received them with 3/4 battery in each bud and only took 15 minutes and were topped off. Wonderful earbuds. Seems like they have an endless supply of powwah!! Lol. 5/5 highly recommend.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-02-20,A tier,"These earbuds have done me well in the past 3ish days. I've used them till they've been drained and the 11 hour play time isn't a joke, these earbuds will last you an entire work / school day with no issues."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-21,Improvements on the original galaxybuds,This are a good buy If you don't own the original galaxybuds because the buds + improve more than invent something new or new features
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-21,Right earbud dead on arrival,Right earbud does not connect/pair. Have to exchange and the new pair will take a month to arrive.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-21,Great Sequel.,"They are honestly a great pair of buds, especially considering the abysmal microphone quality from the previous iteration of Galaxy Buds. The optional double-tap edge volume control is a huge, welcome return from the IconX. The only gripe I have with it is that the touchpad is a tad sensative. While walking outside, the volume, rarely, randomly increased/decreased."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-02-21,they pass I guess,"Bought as alternative to AirPods for my iPhone. They are not as secure when you begin to sweat. They are secure enough to lightly jog but not sprint.. you can't connect to multiple devices without ""forgetting device"" the alternative is using the galaxy buds+ app which doesn't even find other devices. I'll probably end up paying the extra 100 for AirPod pro"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-22,Totally worth it,Big improvement from the 1st version all around. Totally worth the money. Better and cheaper than the airpods pro
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Greatly Improved,I enjoyed the original buds and these are much improved. Battery life is a true 11 hours and they are excellent for phone calls. They are even more comfortable than the others. Worth the price in my opinion.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Absolutely love these!! Definitely buy them!,"I love these so much! I originally got the regular buds the day after the buds+ were released and after watching review videos, I exchanged them for the buds+. The sound quality is so good! Sometimes I like to wear 1 bud I appreciate the sound quality so much more when I wear both! The Galaxy Wear app is very useful for customizing all the settings and I'm still learning new features. I'm very impressed with the ambient sound settings! I wore them to listen to music while at my son's basketball game and was surprised at how well I could hear the music while still hearing what was going on around me. Sound quality with calls is also great. I can hear the person clearly and they can hear me clearly, even if I whisper! I was initially nervous about how they would feel in my ears because they appear kind of bulky but I was pleasantly surprised that they are very comfortable, don't fall out, and my ears don't hurt or feel sore after I take them out, like other earphones I've used. The blue color is not as light as I expected but it's still pretty and I'm still glad I chose this color."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-23,Great buds,"Definitely been better than the original buds (which are pretty good already). Ambient sound and call quality is way better on these, and the bass is definitely better than thw originals."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-02-24,Excellent Sound Quality and Usability. Few issues.,"After having them for 1 week, I would rate these 4 stars out of 5. The sound quality is excellent and the ability to customize each sides function is more useful than I originally thought it would be. The ambient sound feature comes in handy, especially as a delivery driver. Being able to switch from hearing nothing to hearing customers and co-workers without having to remove the earbuds is very convenient. The ear buds have had a few problems, but nothing major. First, and this has only happened twice, is that the earbuds will be out of sync. One earbud will be a few seconds ahead of the other and the only way to fix it I've found is to put them back in the case and wait a minute before using them again. The second issue is occasionally the earbuds will make music come through sound slightly robotic. I'm not sure how to describe it other than that. This only lasts a few seconds at a time and doesn't happen too often. They also randomly switch playlists on Spotify, I haven't had this happen with any other earbuds and it's nothing more than a slight inconvenience. One issue that was almost unbearable was the notifications. They worked perfectly on the first day, but by day 2 it started reading my notification non stop. I would receive a snapchat, and it would repeat ""Snapchat"" endlessly. I ended up turning notifications off and haven't turn them on since. Lastly, they do get uncomfortable to wear for any more than 45 minutes to an hour. I'm not sure if intentional or not, but whenever I remove one of the earbuds from my ear, spotify will either pause the music playing, or resume it if paused. This is useful when I have music playing and it pauses it when I remove an earbud, but if the music is paused and gets resumed when I remove an earbud it just doesn't make sense and it annoying when I have to re-pause the music. I would like to see more functions for the touch pads in the future, maybe like a certain tap pattern that allows the user to lock and unlock the earbuds, rather than having to go into the app to do so. Overall a very good product and I would recommend getting them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-24,Tried and true,These are the first Samsung earbuds I have owned. I love them. Every day is a little bit of a learning curve but the audio is clear and you can control the noise cancellation on your phone or other devices you are connected with.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,0,2020-02-25,Conflict with Xbox Wireless Controller on Samsung Galaxy S7,"I purchased these directly from Samsung as the color I wanted was and still isout of stock here at Amazon at the time of this writing. I was excited to get these as my pre-existing wireless headphones had a really bad audio latency issue (like 1 second) that is really annoying while doing retro gaming on the S7 (I have emulators for basically every 16 bit system from the 80's and 90's, to include Neo Geo). I got the Buds+ in today, and while initially blown away with the quality of the audio, when I try to game on my S7 there seems to be some kind of conflict with the XBox One Wireless controller that also connects to it via Bluetooth. There is a split-second cut-out every 4-5 seconds and there are various audio defects, such as squeaking etc (if you've ever heard a badly record MP3 file you may know what I'm talking about). This issue wasn't present with the PowerBeats that these replaced. There is no audio latency now, but these are basically unusable for this activity and I'm pretty bummed. I googled the problem but didn't find anything or other complaints with the search query terms: Galaxy Buds, Wireless Controller, Conflict etc.
This issue is only present when trying to use both the Buds+ and the Xbox One Wireless Controller (also knows as Microsoft Wireless Controller. I don't want to give these two stars for this but one of the main things I got them for was for gaming while on transit etc on the S7 and I'm still going to need to bring wired headphones with me for that. So 3 stars for this, I will update my review as far as longevity is concerned. Other than that they are really nice coming from wired bluetooth headphones with high latency. I haven't tried the call quality yet but even if that's stellar these still get knocked down to 3 stars for this. This is unacceptable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-02-26,Faulty or that's how its supposed to be.,"I dont know if I got shipped a faulty one but the left side is really low basically not even an earphone and the right side is mediocre, my regular buds blow these out of the water. Kinda disappointing and kinda want my money back."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-26,Very good fit,Sound is good battery is good and fit is really good
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-02-27,Muy buenos,Grandes audífonos con buena duración de batería
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-01,Amazing,Really like the color and the sound quality is amazing. Great upgrade
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,They're amazing,I have the buds plus and the technology in it is very very awesome!! !👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-02,Satisfied customer,Awesome. It's like the phone already know the earBuds+. So as I open the case they instantly connected to my phone (note 10+). Glad I purchased. 5 star recommendations cross the board. 😍😍
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,😍,I love them!! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-05,Ambient sound not made for running,"Initially got them and threw them right in. The sound quality was fine, but they did wiggle a bit. I switched out to a bigger size ear ring, and they fit perfectly. I went for a five mile run out of the box, and they never once moved or came out. I will say that ambient noise is a bit harsh and unusable for running, if the wind hits the right way it is unbearable. The case feels solid and weighted, feels expensive. The ear buds dont fall out due to magnets in the case. Setup is not super easy. You pull the case out of the box, open it, and you are prompted to connect. You press yes, followed by agree or disagree to share info and your set up. I had a small gear update, but didnt take over 2 minutes. I have been wearing them for 4 hours now and they feel fine. No ear fatigue, and have not budged a single time from original position. I will try to update after they die to comment on battery life. I am worried about the not dust or waterproof part. Hopefully special care is not needed, but we will see with time."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-05,It was okay,"These are good, but not for too long. They keep getting disconnected from the phone. Sound was lagging, after resetting it a couple of times i decide to reurn it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-08,I am still a fan of Samsung but sound fidelity is sorely lacking.,"Samsung is an innovator and is one of the few companies that continues to be a top technology beast. I own more Samsung devices than any other products from the other manufacturers. I may have put the bar too high when it came to the buds plus and am admited audiophile. But I also know this company is up to the challenge. Whith all that said here are my pro's and cons concerning this highly coveted and quite frankly very good pair of wireless ear buds. Pro's:
Very excellent and quick bluetooth 5.0 connection with codecs that span both apple, android and PC. All of the tech bells and whistles. i.e. bluetooth 5.0, ambient sound, USB C, wireless fast charging, low profile awsome comfort and fit, very unique and reliable touch controls, independent earbud connectivity, multiple device pairing, volume control that works by tapping your ears, personalizes audio profile using a hearing test, gorgeous colors for both buds matching case. Premium look and feel. Gear wearable app feature rich and dependable. No latency with audio and video that I could discern. Find my bud is very impressive. Ability to program touch features to individual preference. Battery life is out of this world. And the list goes on. Con's:
Audio is one dimensional. Bass is non existent. Audio is low. Call audio is lacking any type of quality. Except in isolating background noise. The magnets holding the buds in the case might as well not be there. Buds and case are way too slippery. Low IP rating. Recommendations:
I recommend going to a dual or even quad driver set up with crossover to separate sound and give a better sound stage with true high fidelity. As your S20 has proven that many people are willing to pay the extra money for Samsung product so focus on audio quality especially when it comes to phone calls. Yes these are better than the originals but other companies are light years ahead of you in this department. I am a Samsun fan and I know that you will step up to the plate. I am the proud owner of a Samsung watch, a phone, tablet, 75"" outdoor TV, 65"" curved TV and would have loved to complete my ecosystem with the Bud Plus. Also texturize the case and the buds to prevent slippage. A higher IP rating would also be nice."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-09,Super Uncomfortable,"These headphones were extremely uncomfortable and hurt my ears. The headphone didn't fit into my ear properly and so that made the sound quality horrible. These were going to be my first higher end pair of ear buds, but I'm definitely sticking to the cheaper brands that work just as well if not better than these."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,0,2020-03-10,One of them it wasn't working,My husband bought me the buds for a present. And when I used them I noticed that one of them it wasn't working and he forgot to return them so now I want to know if we can get our money back.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-10,They're amazing!,So far I love these things! Still playing with them and trying to find the right fit for me! Its really important to me to be able to hear my audio books when I'm in public so far I think between the 3 pairs of blue tooth wireless buds these are the right ones for me! But the Ultimate test will be when I take the bus and train to work.... 🤔. The only thing that worries me is that they're so heavy... the earbuds themselves! I hope it doesn't cause them to make my ears super sore. But so far so good!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,I'm blue da ba dee dabba da-ee,Super small nice color shinny great with Dolby soundround and the ambient sound control is great!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,The upgrade you need,I had lost the right bud of my previous generation Galaxy Buds and knew I had to get the next one that came out. Had these since launch day and couldn't be more happy about owning them. I use these on a day to day basis and the battery life is incredibly mind blowing. I practically wear them with no problem. My most favorite feature about these are the ambient noise because I'm pretty sure I've already damage my ear drums. So these are able to enhance my hearing and makes me realize I love these. Definitely an upgrade so just get them.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-12,Love them,Use everyday. Works awesome.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-13,Best earbuds I've owned!,Lots of nifty features for earbuds!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-13,Not bad,"It snugged comfortable in the ears especially when u have extra ear tips to fit any size ears. touch seems sensitive and responsive Except for the volume up and down. It's a tad bit difficult to perform a volume control task base on the way you have to place your fingers on the buds. My only gripe is the fact that the buds can't switch between devices without connecting them yourself. The ambient sound control is something is amazing, I enjoy controlling my background noise whenever I want. Can't go wrong with these headphones."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-13,"This is a sign, buy it!",The earphones are amazing. Comfortable and great quality.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-13,Not pairing together,Not pairing together. They're appearing as two separate devices concurrently. I can't have them pair together no matter what I do.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-14,"Good for the price, buy for the battery not sound quality.","I was expecting more out of the ""upgraded audio quality"" from the first Galaxy buds but it is barely noticeable. Otherwise, fantastic battery and performance."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-14,Que tiene buen sonido y mucha carga de bateria,"Me encanta el sonido
Y la duración de la carga"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-14,Tunes out the world.,"These things live in my ears. Sound quality is out of this world. I work near a freeway and these cancel plans noice. When my husband is being annoying, I pop these in with my favorite 90s playlist and am happy as a clam. Battery lasts 2 days. I’d say 1 Plus hours of continually play. Highly Recommend these bad boys."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-15,Better than the first galaxy buds,I really like the color and the sound is even better than the my old pair of galaxy buds. The ambient sound is the number one feature I really really like.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,Works great,Cuts out all noise and sound is great
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-17,Good audio quality but don't use for company phone calls,The sound in these headphones is really good but it's not the best to use for company phone calls. If you are buying these headphones because they have 4 mics that are supposed to be better for phone calls then these are not for you but if you are buying these headphones to listen to music then these are great headphones with clear sound and strong bass.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,No regrets,"I felt compelled to write something. These are amazing! Setup was instantaneous. As soon as I open the case, the buds paired to my phone. The sound quality is teriffic. I will need to test the battery life some more as I just got these today... I was holding off buying them due to the price but I might just start buying these as gifts to people now..."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-18,good product,love them they last a long time and sound just as good as earbuds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,"As a parent who always needs to be aware, these are perfect","Love them so far. The ambient noise setting is perfect. I'm a mom, and have pretty much just stayed away from headphones/earbuds because it blocks out too much of my surroundings (and cant have that with a little one running around) but these allow me to listen to music, an audio book, etc while still hearing my surroundings ( a knock at the door, my kiddo calling me from her room, etc). Amazing!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,Love them.,"I love the sound, color, they dont ""fall"" out."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-20,Very comfortable and compact!,"Comfortable, great sound, compact case, I love them!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Lo mejor,Súper contento
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,AMAZING Earbuds!,These ear buds are AMAZING! I love the ambient sound feature and the way they sit in my ear without hurting them. The charging case is great except that they don't have a loop for key chains or carabiners.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Enjoying these everywhere I go!,These are my first wireless earbuds so I don't really have much to compare to. I investigated a few pairs but decided I wanted a a good pair w/o the huge price tag and features I would never use. So far these are working very well with phone calls and listening. The ambient sound controls are very useful when at work or transit as they allow peripheral noises that allow you to be aware of surroundings. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend these. I am glad I waited for the upgrade as the 1st gen had complaints about call quality.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,buds plus FTW,better than my galaxy buds gen 1
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-22,Not bad,Had to return these because my ear canal is too small so they didn't sit securely in my ears.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-24,Beyond satisfied.,They came on time I absolutely love look and the sound. The ambient sound is absolutely amazing and being able to see my case life is pretty nice. The battery life on my buds last me all day.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-24,Meh. Ok. I guess.,"Pros:
Fit is customizable and good
Sound quality is decent
Cons:
-(1) If i leave them in and walk around, while not in use, ambient noise is substantially dampened to the point that i do not leave them in
- not smart enough. They do not automatically switch to pairing with my phone when i put them on. Sometimes it works, 50% of the time i need to open bluetooth to pair (i have a Samsung galaxy note 8) and about 10% of the time i need to pair 2x for it to work
So overall, i rate these a Meh
- while putting in the Right ear bud during a call, i have frequently accidentally disconnected the call"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-24,Great! So much beeter than the first ones!,I purchased the first buds and those went back! They were so HORRIBLE! These are hands down the best earbuds I have ever owned! I am so glad I gave them another shot!!! Worth the price!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-25,Worth every penny,Amazing earbuds worth every penny
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,"So cool, latest technology",Absolutely amazing!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-27,SO MUCH BETTER,"I had and loved my first Samsung Galaxy Buds and unfortunately lost one of the buds. Thankfully the Samsung Galaxy Buds + were announced and I picked them up day 1.
The first thing you notice is the glossy instead of matte finish, but other than that they look exactly the same. But wow...so many things are better. -Battery life
-Sound quality
-Ambient sound
-Call quality
My only minor complaint is sometimes I wander around with just one earbud in and I find that it will intermittently disconnect and reconnect which was never an issue with my old pair. Also I just wanna say to Samsung. PLEASE for the love of god sell replacement buds or allow the syncing of replacement buds. Samsung themselves can sync two matching buds that weren't purchased together, but does not allow consumers to sync them themselves."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-03-28,Doesn't impress me could do better,Some reason getting extra noise like cracking noise when listening to music or on phone. When on phone have tons of static on them would need to switch to phone becuase of static. Battery last good but case does died within 4 to 5 hours. Contact company and was no help person was rude.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-29,Needs some work,Pretty nice earbuds but sometimes they don't work properly. One time the right earbuds didn't pause or skip the song. Another time the earbuds started producing stactic noises when i lay in my bed. Pretty nice earbuds but they needs some updates
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,Battery life is unbelievable,"Out of all the wireless headsets/headphones/earbuds I've ever tried, these are the best. I have tried Anker's Soundcore, LG's, and a few off-brands, however these Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are the easiest to pair, have the best sound quality, and hands down the best battery life. When you open up the case to the earbuds, they connect right away to my phone (I believe it connects automatically to whatever your paired it with last), so I don't have to fiddle with the settings. The connection is immediate. I can also change the setting to hear more or less of the noise/voices in the background which is good for my line of work. I need to be able to hear people when they call me, but I can still listen to my music. Controls are very easy. Tap to play music, double tap to skip forward a song, triple tap to repeat. There is a special setting to access Bixby (or Siri, I'm sure) or you can change that to alter the ambient noise in the background. I had to change up the silicone ear inserts which was easy to do, and it's very easy to find a combination that will stay in your ear comfortably. I wear mine for approximately 4 hours at a time (10 hours a day), and they are very comfortable (they don't feel heavy or make my ears sore). There is an equalizer of sorts where you can set it to Dynamic, Bass, Treble, etc.
The battery life is phenomenal as I mentioned. The Anker Soundcores claim to have great battery life, but it didn't even last 6 hours on a plane ride with a 100% charge. These last all day, and at the end of the day there is still charge left. I like that there is an app that you can check out the levels for both receivers, and the charging pod. All in all, for $20-$30 more than most brand name wireless earbuds, these have been the best. This was an excellent investment."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,Great investment,Love these great sound quality and a great investment. Next purchase cloud blue s20
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-29,Its ok,I traded an iPhone for a Samsung and I do love the phone but the sound from the earphone is not a s great as other ones I've bought in the past. Wish there was better base and the sound was more evened out. Sounds a bit to flat.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-30,Wonderful and way cheaper than most.,New galaxy s20+came with the first galaxy buds and I loved them lots but my daughter actually loved them more with her iPhone so I made this my excuse to buy the buds+ and I am so glad I did. After a couple of adjustments they fit perfect and sound so good. The ability to make sounds outside the buds is great if you are like me and use them on downtime at work so I don't need to keep taking them out. Even better note is that they are cheaper than air pods if you are an apple user.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-31,A good purchase,All day battery life. And good quality.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-31,"Nice buds, charger cord sucks.","Finally figured out why these kept crapping out on me, the charging cord that came with them only worked for a couple of weeks."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-31,I love them now,"My first impression wasn't the better one, but after use my buds for a couple of weeks I am happy with them. Good sound quality, it fits amazing at my ears and the battery life is unbelievable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-01,Great wireless headset for android.,"My only gripe is that the call quality, while definitely better than the first gen, isn't great. The mics are better but fail when there's any wind. And the call volume is way quieter than the global volume."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-01,AMAZING!!!,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-02,Great product except for delivery,The product itself is really great. Easy pairing and sound is awesome. My only complaint is the way my package was delivered. Came from an Amazon delivery driver who didnt care about my package at all. I live in a big apt building and he carelessly left my package in front of someone else's door on a different floor. Not even close to my apt #. They really need to work on that! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-03,Severely disappointed,"I liked these a lot at first. Then they started cutting in and out sometimes but it wasn't too annoying. They also cut out if the phone was in my pocket. Now that I have had them for a while and amnusing them a lot more because I'm working at home, I wish I hadn't bought them. They cut out constantly even though my phone is right on my desk, they also like to randomly disconnect. Controls work when they want to and they do not stop playing when you take the bus out. I just ended up swapping them out with the $15 regular wireless headphones I have, because I couldn't take it anymore today. So disappointed"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-05,"Very comfortable, but some feedback noise at times","The battery life is excellent, but the noise quality can sometimes be lacking...it sounds as though the sound is breaking up at times if you too far walk away from your phone or are listening in another room despite being only a few meters away. The earbuds fit really nicely in my ears, though-ive had issues with other buds falling out and these stay in snugly and are very comfortable to wear. If Samsung just cleared up some of the feedback sounds when you walk away from your phone a bit, I would definitely give these 5 stars down the line!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-05,Is ok,"Ok no for me
earbud bother to much in my ears
difficult to push bottom for answer call
other big important thing is
This earbuds fell to me 3 times when O eas walking ,,no hold well
so becarefull to drop it in street the earbuds"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,Primo,"The sound is terrific. It doesn't do true noise cancellation, but it does have settings to let in ambient sound, which is a real necessity. They pair instantly and effortlessly with my Samsung phone."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-04-07,Treat your self.,"These things are amazing. Great sound. Great battery life, really it's out of this world. The buds aren't heavy or clunky. The case is slim and smooth. They work independently of each other, with the app the functionality of the touch sensors on the sides is exactly what you would expect with options in their ""Lab"" that are expanding it seems. The touch response is very good, no complaints. The adaptive sound is impressive and doesn't feel invasive in an office setting at low or medium, where high I can see would be great for outdoor activities or exercise. Call quality is probably better than what I can get out of my phone itself (Note 8), I am heard clearly and don't have to worry about asking for or being asked to repeat what was said. As I said, treat your self."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-08,Nice,Love them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Battery Life is Awesome,I love them. They are awesome.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Outstanding,Should have gotten these a loooooooong time ago. These are the best wireless devices I ever purchased.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-09,Stopped working.,Stopped working after 1 month. I would like the seller to contact me.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-09,Galaxy buds.,I did not receive any ear tips or ear wings with my purchase.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-09,Excelente producto y en buenas condiciones.,Excelente producto es cesacionar son muy buenos se escucha muy bien y llegaron en buenas condiciones.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-09,JUST A SAMSUNG GAL....,"Let me just start by saying I had an iphone but when my friend introduced me to Samsung I fell in love. I have an Samsung note 9. I have the Samsung ear bugs plus. I love the quality , sound . Just all around great. I am not tangled up at work and bound by wires. I also love the feature hear far distances. In settings on the app and also the phone. It makes it clear and crisp. Both settings together makes it hear clear."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-10,Sounds pretty good,These won't pair with my Pixel 4 or my Lenovo Yoga. They're getting sent back. I love AKG and really looked forward to these but if they don't work they are junk. Thanks to Samsung I was able to get them paired so I'm going to give them a shot.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-04-11,Samsung Buds+ Honest Review.,"These are definitely the best sounding ear buds I've ever used. They are decently bass heavy & sound clear for just about any genre. I listen to mostly rock music, & I can hear the bass drum hit every single time. Thats pretty awesome for ear buds. Keep in mind, you really have to make them fit right to get the best sound out of these. When they first came in, I used the wing tips that came on the buds, and it made it so they didn't go all the way into my ear. They sounded VERY quiet & I thought about returning. After adjusting the tips & finding what fits perfectly. They literally sound like different ear buds now. Even on half volume I can't hear anything around me unless I turn on the ambient sound. Which works wonderfully to. So for sound quality. Id easily give 9/10. Now for the noise cancelation, it works amazing. You can set it up in the Galaxy wear app to turn it off & on by holding down on one of the ear buds. Amazing feature, if I want to hear my surroundings or just drown everything out. I can do that without pulling out my phone. The ambient sound is also pretty clear, & it really picks up the sounds you want. I recommend using the medium setting, worked the best for me! As for noise cancelation I'd give it a 9/10. Now for the best part of these ear buds. THE BATTERY LIFE. I never thought I'd find ear buds that could last through the day. But I found ear buds that can last MULTIPLE days. Seriously no joke. 11 hours on a single charge. Plus the case holds about another full charge for both ear buds. I listen to them mostly right above half volume. & they last 11 hours. Or even more some times. They sound great for making calls as well. I can walk on pretty busy streets & people can hear me just fine, without to much background noise. As for the battery life. 10/10. I definitely recommend these to anybody. Obviously if you have a Samsung device, these will work the best, but they are compatible with iphones & other phones. I'll give them a 10/10 because I'm super pleased with the purchase. These do everything I want from an ear bud, and sound great while doing it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-11,great product so far,love the sound and ease of connecting. the size are a bit big in my ears. I am kind of small eared. But able to make it fit and size is great.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-12,Audio lag when connected to devices other than phone,"I am a college student and with the ongoing pandemic, I figured I would splurge a little and treat myself to good quality earbuds. Colleges praised the mic on the original galaxy buds and friends sounded crystal clear over calls with these buds. I received my pair and absolutely loved them for about a week. They work miraculously paired to my Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Wearable app makes these buds sound extremely nice. Everything works smoothly when connected to my phone, however when I connect to my Surface Pro 7, these buds have a serious audio lag. I tried for hours to mess with my audio settings to make sure it was not my device but nothing seems to fix the issue. This makes it extremely problematic and almost impossible to participate in meetings and online lectures. People can hear me fine but my audio cuts out constantly. The same happens with listen to music and videos and is extremely annoying for having spent so much dough. I shot my shot and concluded they great for commutes and leisure but not fantastic for classwork. Again they work fine paired to a phone, but they are trash when paired to laptop devices."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,Worth the money.,"I was skeptical at first because I have small ears and nothing seems to fit me right. I was afraid they'd either fall out or hurt my ears. It took me a few days to get used to them but I car wear them all day at work without making my ears sore. I've not had them fall out once since I figured out which wingtip to use. That's impressive for me, I've not had an earbud that felt like it fit me right since the older flat style. Battery life is impressive, I wear the right one for my whole 8 hour shift every day and it still has life left at the end of the day. As far as sound quality goes I'm probably not the pickiest person out there, but I think they sound great. I've only been on a call a few times with them but didn't have any problems. I use a Galaxy S10e phone and connection is instant as soon as you open the case. No disconnect problems at all so far. This is coming from someone who until a few weeks ago didn't wear earbuds and didn't like things in their ear - I love them. I could've gotten the black ones at my Best Buy but I ordered from Amazon for the Cloud Blue, and I'm so glad I did, they're so pretty."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-12,Noise cancellation,I had high expectations knowing Samsung but wow. Mind was blown on the noise cancellation. Sound is crystal for a pair of earbuds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-14,Great investment for me.,I work in a noisy truck and I have to talk with customers now again. Great for cancelling the truck noise but can still hear customers without changing anything I have set.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,best earbuds,I use earbuds while I work so I need good quality with a long battery life. With these I don't have to charge them every night but every few days. They are comfortable and I like the ambient setting. The app is easy to use too.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,Great 😊,"Ambient sound option is okay but not the best, but I didn't purchase these for their ambience. Long battery life (bout three days, with case included) and they don't fall out of my ears when I run :)"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-15,I love it!,I love it!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,Comfortable and secure,"I'd been wanting to get true wireless earbuds for a while. I stayed away from Apple's AirPods because the shape for whatever reason will not stay in my ear (and their AirPod Pros were more than I was willing to pay). After reading up on the reviews of a few different wireless earbud brands, I was between these and the Jabra Elite Active 65t. For me, I was looking for earbuds that fit comfortably and securely, even through physical activity like running. I cared less about sound quality and call quality (as long as it was decent). I liked that the Jabra buds were intended for exercise, but in the end I went with the Samsung earbuds as I liked them a little better aesthetically, and the reviews said they were fine while wearing them on runs. I've had them for almost a month now, and they've been great! I've gone on a couple runs with them, as well as wearing them for other workouts. It took my ears a couple days to get used to them, but now they fit very comfortably. The wing tips ensure they're super secure in my ears, and I never feel like they're going to fall out. The sound quality and call quality are both fine as well, and no complaints about the battery life."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-17,Good sound,"The sound quality is good, not great. They sit in my ears well and are fairly comfortable after long periods of use. I wish they had noise canceling when using for phone calls."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-17,Convenient and comfortable,"Very convenient since I have the galaxy s20 plus and there isn't an audio port. The sound quality during phone calls is excellent, music quality could be better I prefer more bass in my ear buds but can't complain too much. The buds are lightweight and comfortable to keep in my ears for long periods of time. Overall this is a very good product and I'd recommend it"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-17,Good product but stopped working after 17 days,Stopped working after 17 days. Not used for workout or in rain. Used for call purpose only. Going to return them. The product is good but there might be some issue with my unit.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-17,Quality.,"For Starters, WOW! 1.Bluetooth range, AWESOME! I waked all the way into my garage and shut the door and the bluetooth connection didn't crack. This is AWESOME! 2. Sound. Another Awesome improvement. The Ambiant Sound feature has also been greatly improved. I highly recommend These. I would get one of the light colors though. Dark colors hold heat. I know this because years ago I was wearing black jeans waiting for a bus. the top of my thighs started to burn. when I got home. they were red and it hurt like heck."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Awesome product!,just got these in today. Super stoked to use them right away. Both buds were already almost fully charged. Sound and quality is great!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-04-19,Samsung does it again!,Absolutely love these! Samsung never disappoints me. Absolutely no complaints. I have issues with fitting headphones in my small ears and these fitike a glove.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-19,Great,Best ear buds out there.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,My van is tan colored.,"Was surprised they came in this color, I've only seen them in black and in pearl colors. So the light blue was really cool color to have. I've always liked light blue as a color. I'm very satisfied with my purchase."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-20,Worst product ever. Doesn't compare to iphone airpods or airpods pro.,Battery life and sound quality horrible. There is no noise cancelling in this device
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,The best 👏👏,I use them all the time and I absolutely love them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Galaxy buds are awesome,This product is exactly what I expected.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,"Love it, perfect gift for Mom","Bought this as a gift for Mom, she loves it and thinking of upgrading mine soon"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Superior sound and fit in the ear,These earbuds fit so much better in ear than the airpods. No more earbuds falling out when I'm exercising! They also have superior sound and I love the touch controls! A great item!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-22,They're awesome when they aren't making your conversations sound robotic.,"The buds are really great! Especially on battery life. However, they disconnect soo much even after multiple developer updates. Talking on the phone while using wifi is horrid. The person you're talking to sounds like a robot. Other than that I would say that these are some pretty solid upgrades from the older models."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Great for at work,These are perfect for at work and sound great. The pass through sound works well too. The best part is the battery life on these and ease of use with my iPhone
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Hi Fidelity Sound,"Just got my buds +. Easy setup, fits snug and easy pairing with my iphone. Will blow the competition off with the sound production. I have them on for 2 hours now and don't feel any pain or discomfort. Excellent buy."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-23,Only one ear bud,They delivered me one earbud and didn't realize it until my son told me I'm supposed to have (2) earbuds one for the right and one for the left.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Great sound!,Great sound. Easy to use. Comfortable fit.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Very pleased,I am very pleased with my purchase. Came nicely packaged and they look and sound great.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Best set I’ve owned at good price,These are the wireless earbuds you’ve been waiting for! Take the time and read the owners learn all the settings and totally customize them to make them totally tailored to you personal liking!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-25,Mostly what I was looking for.,"The Galaxy Buds+ have a nice neutral sound profile, which is what I prefer. The drivers are not dynamic enough for proper tuning, but I get the sound that I want out of them. No overbearing bass, and for the most part, pretty clear sounding. In my limited (so far) use with calls, the call quality in both directions is really good. The Buds+ app for iOS is very basic. You get pretty much all the features offered, at least. The comfort is very meh. I prefer using something akin to the ""wings"" included with this kit, but Samsung did a very poor job designing them. What comes in the package is a large wing, small wing, and no wing cover. Both wings fit my ears, with the small wing having the best fit, but the wings are a bit hard and not properly contoured to fit without pressure points. If Samsung fixes the wing design, I could easily put that 5th star on there. As it stands now, if I want a worry free secure fit, I have to use the small wing and face eventual discomfort, requiring removal from my ears. If I want to have a long listening session, I don't use the wing, but the fit is much less secure. Overall, these are very good earbuds for the price with what I think is an easily fixable flaw. I'm planning to provide Samsung direct feedback about this as their focus on audio and call quality at this price range is important to me, and I'd love to see the next version be even better."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Best Quality,Im Inlove
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-26,Product description is wrong,Either defective or a complete lie from Samsung. The IconX had better sound quality then these and the supposed 11 hours of music streaming i got about 5 out of it.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-26,"GREAT HEADPHONES,!",Truly amazing headphones! The ambient sounds is the main reason I bought these and was really impressed! There not crazy loud but they are loud enough and have plenty of customization in the app you use with them.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-26,best feature is battery,"So i have a a big expectation seeing that this is the second gen Samsung buds but compared to the amazon echo buds. theses are just not that great. Noise)
So i work in data centers where we have machines running 24/7. with the noise cancellation on the Samsung Buds (SB) i can still hear the machines enough to where i need to turn up the volume to a certain extent. none of the settings provided by the Galaxy app helped this at all. Sound)
The sound quality is good when using the passthrough interface. you can clearly hear the person who is trying to speak to you. you can also use it during calls which i think is great. but again the noise cancellation is where this gets lost in. Set up)
Set up was easy. just open the galaxy wearable app and it'll automatically connect. it does so every time you open the box for the buds. i like how long the battery lasts. i still don't think it's a lot because i charged it full one day and later the same day it was down to 17% while the buds remained at 100%. Also the tap and double tap features are only limited to what the app will let you do with them. With the Alexa Echo buds you are free to use those buttons and set them up as you wish. Overall)
i liked the wireless charging that came with these headphones so i don't have to worry about charging them over night, i have a pad where i put my phone, watch and now headphones. if you can ignore outside noises on your own and don't care about not getting anything from the Galaxy app. these headphones are for you."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-26,Best upgrade I did,Had the original Buds and eventually after a couple months I lost volume in one of them and tried everything but they were a bust. The bud plus on the other hand was a major upgrade. Had it for months and it always produced a clean sound every time. Great bass and better features than the origianls. I was not disappointed.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Great product,"Amazing sound, battery life and quality of the product is great"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-27,plus - great multi-function - full sound. minus - Ambient sound wind noise,These are great. They fit well and I don't feel as if I'm missing any of the music. My only problem is the ambient sound when I'm running or riding the bike. The wind noise becomes unbearable; Even at low speeds with ambient set to low. I have to turn ambient off. That's not great since I got these so that I would be more aware of my surroundings while doing these activities.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-28,Not too bad.,"the case battery isn't great, but it's not bad. I have to turn off the headset and turn it back on for it to work when on the phone. Literally the ONLY downside."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Very Nice Headphones,Love these headphones. The noise cancellation could be better but they are overall great. Long battery life.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-28,Happy!,Just got it today! Super easy to pair and get started. No complaints and love the color! Only thing missing was a second cushion thingy of the biggest size. Super happy with my purchase! Will update review if anything changes :)
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-29,I am in love,"Just perfect. Was sketchy about spending this much on buds. Samsung made sure they were worth it. If you're thinking about buying, just do it."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-16,Great upgrade from legacy galaxy buds,"I sent in my galaxy buds under warranty for peeling clear coat after 6 months of use. I really loved them but didn't think it was right to have peeling paint so soon. While on the call with Samsung, the customer service rep told me of buds plus. I instantly offered to pay the difference to get the upgrade rather than the regular buds as replacement. Sadly, they said their policy did not allow it... fast forward to today. I got the replacement and to my surprise, they sent me a buds plus!!! What customer service! This is why I only buy Samsung for my electronics. And yes, the sound and call quality is noticeably improved over the normal buds. Just got off 3 back to back calls and I didn't have to deal with people not hearing me anymore. SWEET~"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,Great buds!,Enjoying the buds already! I owned Bose Soundsport Free in the past. But these buds are so much better. They fit better and don't fall off easily.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,Great product,"They look good, feel good, and sound good. Amazing Earphones! The red really pops!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,0,2020-03-17,()\(*_~)/() Good But Still Lacking,"The Momentum TWS Are Now $200
Some Pros
The Buds+Plus r a nice upgrade . They sound good with great call Quality and noise isolation . They actually stay in my ears unlike my liberty air II ear buds . The hear through is awesome . Its like super hearing . Some Cons
Sound Quality Is Not As Good As My Cheaper Liberty Air II Which Have A Wealth Of Features The Buds+Plus Do Not Have . You Can Get Liberty Pro 2 for $119 - $149 That Blow The Buds+Plus Away Even More . I Sent My Buds+Plus Back As The Longer I Had Them The More Disappointment Outweighed The Good Things About My Buds+Plus ."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,Red is the best!,The updated features make these much better than the original. Not going to say sound quality is much better but the original buds sounded great to begin with. The new Galaxy wearable app is great with more info/features for the Bud+.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-17,"New Bud, same fit and shape, great updates, better sound.","I bought the original buds when they came out and I like them and still use them. On a whim I saw the new ones in red so bought myself a new set of the Buds +. First off the red is sick.. It's not just flat red, it's metallic red.. pretty snazzy. Paired easy to both my Note 9 and my iPhone XS Max with no problems.. upon initial set up with my note, there was a software update. Which was simple and straight forward. I like how these fit and they are comfortable.. they don’t feel like they will budge once locked in. I typically like my AirPods Pro but these fit better. I don’t get these reviews saying these aren’t loud enough!?!? What are y’all deaf or something? These are best at 60-70% volume or are too loud otherwise for me."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-18,Galaxy buds red,"Great Product, red is very appealing."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,Llego antes de lo esperado,Buenos auriculares muy bonitos y llegaron muy rapido
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,Convenient. Not really for true audiophiles,"It's not noise cancelling. You'll still hear your surroundings or at least you can still hear someone talk to you. I was told that my phone chats make me sound a lot better and my listening to my calls sounds rather normal compared to my phone. The music quality will never beat wired headphones. It lacks in the lower and partially mid range area. At first it isn't noticable off the bat. But you'll start to hear the difference when comparing it to other headphones. I would still buy these. They fit nicely in my ears. I can run and shake my head and it won't fall out. It's good for the gym, for calls, for travel. The battery lasts longer than I care to have it in my ears. If I wanted amazing sounding ear buds, I wouldn't be buying bluetooths."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-19,Love them,Love these headphones and the color made my day...exactly what I expect from samsung
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-19,EXTREME issues on multiple purchases,"I must be the most unlucky person with these. I've payed for 4 pairs, only 2 have arrived. I don't know what amazon's problem is but they've lost two during prep for shipping, so they were ""undeliverable."" I had to call in to get my refund, 9 days later, even though they showed the record of undeliverable. Ridiculous. Shipping isn't the fault of the manufacturer, but quality is. I've had a black pair (bought retail at best buy, because amazon couldn't get me a pair, even when I paid) had terrible feedback and interference issues. Randomly during jogging, it would get garbled and have extremely poor distortion that was physically painful. So I returned those to Best Buy. Then the red version became available on amazon. Sure, why not, try once more. If this doesn't work out, I'll just move on to something else. Oh boy. So they were great. For 3 days. Then they lost their volume. Maybe it was a setting in my phone? I saw that was a thing online. Nope, and tried it on 5 other devices from tablets, to my computer, TV, direct connect to an echo device, etc. It was bad on all of them. Basically it wore itself out in 3 days. Had the tinny sound of a dying driver. Not exactly a good sign. So I have to give this the worst rating, as it is extremely poor in quality control. Nobody is making sure these are well made before shipping. I might be the 1 or 2 percent that slips through, but it happened more than once. I cannot say with any confidence that anyone should buy these terrible earbuds. Massive thumbs down. Until then, I'll go back to my big Sony Hear On 2's. I wanted something compact vs over-the-ear, but obviously Samsung has struck out."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-03-20,Disappointed,I had been waiting since February to receive the red color buds + and when I first put them in my ears and hit play on music the righ bud sounded like it didnt work. When I turned the volume all the way up there was very little sound coming from the bud. I was very disappointed I got a pair of defective buds when I waited so long to get them😔.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-20,Honest Review // Opinión Honesta,"In general terms, it's a very good product, it has a very good sound and i'm very strict with this, i love that this products has all the functionalities with all other devices including Windows 10, i'm talking about the touchPad, the battery of these buds is amazing, i used them for about 3 hours and when i checked the battery, it was at 80%, the thing i don't like is that they are not that confortable, at least for me, i used to have the Airpods the whole night, but in this case as they are IN EAR headphones, are complicated to have them for long periods of time. The case in the other hand looks awesome, but doesn't feel premium considering the price."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,Better Than My AirPods Pro,"Having owned a pair of AirPods Pro for an iPhone they worked fine but I didn’t like the fitment they felt when putting them in my ear and would slide out a bit to be a bothersome especially when working out and having to stop every time to adjust them. These Galaxy Buds+ are in my regards way better than the Pros and actually fit in my ear making a snug seal. The Genie Red Color looks so premium and is an overall great pair of buds to admire. I am using an iPhone with these Buds and Samsung actually made an App specifically designed for the Buds+ In the App Store with the UI being similar to what you’d find on the Android PlayStore In doing so you’d be getting the same great features with no compromise of losing out on the Ambient sound. My only niche that I have with these Buds is that the Pros coexist with Siri so you’d be able to say “Hey Siri” without taking your phone out of your pocket but the same can be achieved on these Buds you just have to hold manually on the touch pad to initiate Siri to start listening, but can’t blame Samsung for that since that would have to come from Apple. Apart from that I don’t miss my AirPods Pro one bit and I enjoy using these whenever I’m at work, or driving on long trips being able to make calls is great."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-21,definitely an improvement over the first two models,"battery life is excellent sound is much better than the buds. I have the iconxX the buds and now the buds+ and I have to say these are quite an improvement over the first two models. I got them in red, had to wait a little longer but it was worth it they look great. They connect a lot faster the battery lasts much longer, I use the dynamic sound setting and it sounds good with bass and treble balanced. They also charge faster than previous models including the base. The range from the phone has been improved and phone call Quality is 10 times better."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-23,Amazing,Awsome.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-23,A+,"Dropped my old ones in the ocean, these plus are a definite upgrade. I like the base levels, and the battery life is amazing. Also the ambient sound mode 3 makes you have super hearing."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-23,Close To Perfection.,"Just like last gen, these connect and pair like lightning. (Be aware if you owned last gen buds you will not have to agree to a bunch of random things when first pairing). I choose the red ones personally and the crazy attention to software detail BLOWS my mind. -Depending on which varient you bought for example, if you bought the Cloud Blue varient when you connect it will show a pop up of your buds (Seperately) battery life and case charge and the EXACT color of your case + buds which is a tremendous amount of thought given. -In the App (YOU NEED TO HAVE IT INSTALLED, it will make your life 1billion percent better) they also match the colors also
The longevity drives me crazy! Samsung says these buds get 11 hours on one charge, I haven't charged these things in a week, because I only use my buds during workouts, while cleaning the house, and morning jogs. And they last Forever (BUT with dynamic mode which seems to be the best, the battery does take a 2 hour hit keep in mind)
And I have to say even though these don't have a ipx4 rating the ipx2 is enough for now, while moving, intensive 2 hour workout routines these buds have not given up on me (If they do I will update the review). And they fit PERFECTLY, earsize is a big deal and the wings and eartips provided should work for almost everyone. Also one thing people do not talk about enough is the dang size, compared to the Sony's WH-1000xms, Airpods Pros, and even Sennheiser true wireless momentum, They are small and extremely easy to fit in the ear (Even for peoe with small ears), this suprised me a lot because I used to own Gear IconX's (The ugly reject of Samsungs Line) and they were terrible in every way. Lastly, I want to go into sound and audio, as someone who is an audiophile these did not blow my mind or change my world (I didn't expect them to), these were just right/enough. Dare I say they sound close to the WH-1000xms and the Airpod Pros my friends have Do Not have as much bass and do not get as loud. These things sound great for their price point, but temper your expectations since they are aimed at convenience, more than audio (Which is what I drastically needed for my extraneous work outs). And AKG is known for their Audio Hardware and tuning so this was an easy decision to make biased on their decades of experience in the Audio industry. -Sidenote the Call Quality and Ambient Modes are MILES greater than the past Galaxy Buds not even a question."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,0,2020-03-23,Worth it!,Amazing earbuds! These sound quite amazing for something so tiny.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-03-24,Defective,I can not fully rate these. I bought these last week and received them on Friday after waiting 4 days. When I finally get them one of the ear buds was defective and didnt work. I called samsung and was told to mail them back in. Which I did on the same Friday via UPS. Samsung received the earbuds yesterday. I called to check the status of new earbuds and was told them would possibly arrive by next Tuesday. So I have to wait a week before I get new ones. I cancelled the order to get a refund and to be told that the exchange/refund office is out of the office and my refund would take alot longer. SMH! !
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-03-24,great!,"had mild connectivity issues with it, but so far so great. Got the additional warranty though from experience. So far i love it and the color is gorgeous."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-24,"Awesome, to have them in and talk to people.","The ambient sound feature, is super cool. The red ones are, really cool. The quality is good, for less than a $1,000."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,Better than apple airpods 2 pro and for $100 less,"I work in a loud factory and I had the apple airpods 1st gen that have zero noise cancelation. It was time for a upgrade. I was thinking about getting apple airpods 2 pro but for the price tag of $250? No. I went with these. They don't have active voice cancelation, but the nice seal it has around the ears makes up for that. They are super customizable. Being able to turn ambient noise on and off with the push of a button is amazing. When I use the forklift at work I can turn ambient noise on and hear everything around me with amazing clarity. HiGHLY recommended. A game changer"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,Worth every penny!,"Absolutely worth every penny, sound quality is great and the ambient noise setting is both versatile and useful. It really adds a whole new level of sound that borderline on asmr when your music is turned off. Microphone quality is excellent and the battery and recharge times are amazing. I love how easy it was to pair with my galaxy phone and the controls are easy to use. All in all, I'm incredibly happy!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-27,SimplyRed!!,"Beautiful! I choose the red pair and they are simply gorgeous! I have the previous version however, they made minor changes that make the plus version worth purchasing. For example, the extended battery life, the shiny color which looks amazing, and the upgrade in the app shows the charging case battery status."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,A fairly decent upgrade.,"So I have the regular Galaxy Buds, and the Jabra Elite 75T Active. I mostly listen to my earbuds at work, usually in one ear, but when I'm out and about I'll have both in. However the Galaxy Buds didn't last through out the day, and the Jabra Elite's actually had even worse battery life than the original Galaxy Buds despite claiming otherwise. Jabra's sounded much better no contest however. I upgraded to the Galaxy Buds+ Hoping to find a medium between the two. To my surprise it really doesn't sound any better at least to my ears than the regular Galaxy Buds, so if that is your sole reason for upgrading I wouldn't do it. It also isn't any louder than the originals. However it does have other features that I enjoy quite a bit. In the option menu you can turn on gaming mode, which eliminates audio delay pretty well. It also has an option to turn the ambient mode up even higher than normal. Much higher than the original Buds, and the Jabras. Another thing that you can do that you couldn't do in the original is use ambient mode with only one ear bud in your ear. Perfect for when I'm at work. However I only recommend doing this with the right ear bud, I think that is the only bud with the extra microphone. (It works fine with both in however)
Connectivity outside in my pocket is still about as spotty as the original on my Galaxy S9. Though better than the Jabra. However the microphone quality has improved quite a bit. Once again only through the right speaker, it probably won't sound that amazing on making calls with only the left earbud in. The originals were pretty horrible, I tended to just take my phone out and talk normally through it, but now I just take the calls from the ear buds. Overall I'd say the ear buds are a solid upgrade. If all you care about is sound quality for music I'd go with the Jabra Elite 75T. It sounds better and gets louder than the Buds+. However I only got around 4 hours on the Jabra's despite it claiming 7.5. So Battery life, Ambient Sound while playing music, gaming mode all go to Buds+
TL:DR Version - Don't upgrade for sound quality, Upgrade for better call quality, gaming mode, higher ambient sound mode that also now works with a single ear bud, and battery life. For people who don't have either, I also recommend if you have a samsung device, as it will tell you when you receive messages, and who is calling you."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,Samsung Is As Good As Bose Or Better!!!,"This is my second pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds. My first pair was a promo with my new Galaxy Note 10+. Both sets of my Samsung Galaxy earbuds matched up with both my phone and my iPad much easier and fit better than my Bose did. My Bose earbuds were more difficult to deal with and bigger, and kept slipping out of my ears even with the smallest attachment. Great job Samsung!! !"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-03-29,Amazing 👌,Wow what a great product!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-02,Nice color!,"I love the red! I not one to use ear buds often, but the price was good and so is the product."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,1,2020-04-04,"Great Fit, Muffled Sound!",Initially bought for perceived quality and expected sound experience and was severely let down by sound quality with a complete lack of quality bass and treble! They fit and feel high quality and the case is beautiful but after adjusting the settings for hours I was disheartened to learn it was as good as it got which wasn't very good for $149! They do not sound as well sorted as even the wired speakers that come with the phone. I plan on returning after 1 week of ownership
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-04,Right bud wont connect,"Right ear bud will not connect. Tried resetting it, uninstalling samsung wearables. one website said try updating the app to get the right bud to work but the update says it cant update UNTIL the right bud works. Very upset after 150$. I bought another pair from another brand for my wife and those work beautifully easily and without hassle. Just wish my right bud would connect as these look better in my opinion. but whats looks matter if it doesnt work."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,Awesome earbuds,"I had a pair of Jabra elites that IMO sounded a little nicer, but I had constant issues with them disconnecting randomly when I would walk a little bit away from my phone or get a call. These earbuds are solid. No disconnection issues ever, even in pouring rain. I don't think the battery can die in a single day. I wore them from when I woke up until I went to sleep and they're still going strong on day 2."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,Best wireless buds so far,"Love my new galaxy buds , the red color is amazing . Now I need to get the blue buds"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-04,Exceeded my expectations.,I passed on my original Buds to my son and he loved them. I got these and they sound better and battery life is good too. No complaints. I love them. I use them with my S10+. I got them in red and they look cool. Thanks Samsung & Amazon.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-06,Highly recommend,Zero negative or complaints on this product. I use it mainly for phone calls and highly recommend.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,2,0,2020-04-07,Not worth it,Dont buy these they are not worth it for $150. I bought them thinking they would sound better than the earbuds that came with my s10 plus but they dont. They sound worse than a $15 pair of AKG wired earbuds. There is no noise cancelling and they have ambient mode so you can here more outside sounds. I think they have it mixed up. The battery life is okay but after 5 minutes of usage the already go down by 2%. Get a pair of wired AKG or a pair of beats.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,Yaaas,Had a set before they got lost. Love Samsung Electronics/ products. These newer versions are even better & I love this red! Comfortable for long periods of time easily portable & the ambient sound works wonderfully!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-08,I'm Very Happy with These,"They're not Bose, but they sure get the job done! They sound great and don't hurt my ears. They don't fall out. Several fit options to use. Love them with my Note 10+ and my computer. Great for Zoom calls and my favorite color is RED!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-10,Affordable and great sound quality,"These Bud's are amazing. With the Ambient sound turn off, loud outside noise is minimal and regular level noise is non-existent. The paring was automatic. I pulled out of the case and my Galaxy Wearables popped up and they were ready to go"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-14,Ugh. Disappointing but useable.,"UPDATE: So, I'm actually changing my star rating from 2 to 4. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+ phone and I was able to dial in a decent sound on these after finding a hidden setting called Adapt Sound (had to search for it in settings). By telling my phone that I am over 60 years old in the accessibility settings it finally bumped the volume to a useable level. To share the settings I found livable... Dolby Atmos OFF, Adapt Sound ""Over 60 years old"" with Sound Preference ""Soft"" (this cuts the boomyness out of the bass and raises the volume significantly)... in the Wear app, Ambient sound on Low... Equalizer set to Clear. I found the clear equalizer to be the best once the volume was higher. With these settings, these headphones are totally acceptable. It is odd to me that the originally Galaxy buds seemed to fair better right out of the box but I'm pretty happy with these now. My original 2-star review:
Samsung took the one thing I loved about the sound quality of the previous earbuds and killed it. The original Galaxy Buds were decently loud and had clear, focused, balanced sound. Not too boomy, lush midrange and really well done clear high end. They got that out of a single sound driver. I always used to use the normal setting on the Wear software... it was perfect to my taste. The Galaxy Buds Plus, split the sound driver into two (Bass and Treble driver). The attention to crossover sound is really bad. Just lacking in the midrange. I've tried EVERY setting possible. The clear setting is great, just one problem... when you use the clear setting, the volume will not go loud enough. It sounds super lacking to my ear. The dynamic setting is the only one I find loud enough but it makes the bass SO boomy. Like not in a good way. Complete loss of focused sound. IF they could get the CLEAR setting to bump like 6 to 12 more decibels, these would be almost perfect. Which is super frustrating because that is clearly just a software limitation. Samsung, please give audiophiles more control over the sound! Give Wear an advanced mode where users can dial in their sound... and I get that you are trying to protect people's hearing, but please let me check a box and sign a waiver to allow me to dial up the volume just a bit higher. The max volume on these isn't nearly enough to be acceptable."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-14,"""Find your buds"" feature is the best.","The quality is great on these buds but it needs more bass. That's it in a nutshell. Besides that I love the noise cancelation and the ability to find your buds in case you lose them. I admit it, I lost my last pair of razor gaming buds and wish they had the find your buds feature. In valuable in my opinion. Until more buds get this feature I'll stay with Samsung buds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-14,Very nice quality,"Great product. Paired so easily to my phone. Really nice quality. Good fit, sound is good and they are easy to use."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,AWESOME!!!,"I've bought airpod pros, bose and Samsung buds+ at the same time....i took the bose and airpods back. Samsung hands down. Trust me...big difference in quality, sound and clarity. Definitely worth it. More options as well. Plus 1 year warranty"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-16,Good quality,I am very pleased with these ear buds. They fit very well and the sound is very good. They can get as loud as I would ever want them to. They really don't fall out of my ears unless I'm listening to Bon Jovi and dancing like an 80s teenage girl.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-17,Good Product worth the 150$,Good overall product with good bass and clear crisp sound. The only down side is the battery life is only 3 hours but the case saves it I guess. Really good quality.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,0,2020-04-18,Mediocre,Verdict on Galaxy buds mediocre sounding headphones battery pack life mediocre one full charge headphone battery life excellent full six hours. I would spend 99 not the 130 I was charged. For that price I should get more bass.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-18,Great Product,Great upgrade from original buds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,los recomiendos muy buenos,Aparte de que son muy bonitos se escuchan muy bien
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,Buy them,They're just what I was expecting! They sounds better than the first Galaxy buds
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-20,I love the Buds,incredible i loved them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,Great buds!,Really enjoy the sound quality. Comes in clear. It pairs great with my Note 10+.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,Exactly what i expected,Ayeer that's pretty good.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-21,Great Quality,"They arrived a day early and OMG!!! SO PRETTY! So far, so good! Im already in love :)"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,#1,"Amazing headphones, I had the airpods first gen and they blow them out of the water. Definitely worth the price! The sound is crisp and clear and they do a good job of noise cancelation also."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,3,1,2020-04-22,Analyze the pieces it comes with AS SOON AS IT ARRIVES!,"I was really excited on getting them, however; once I analyzed the buds I realized that the material for the ear piece and the case it's self is very cheaply made (at least when compared to the first generation) and as I was changing the ear wing to a larger size, I noticed that the right one was slightly ripped from the bottom and figured that it would rip over time. I tried to get ONLY the earwing replaced, but costumer support wasn't much help. After talking to several reps, I finally decided to replace the whole product for a new one. Sorry Samsung, I was kind of disappointed this time around. Over all, the buds have a really nice touch to it (at least the red one does), and the added mic is excellent!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Versatile earbuds.,Amazing earbuds. The sound quality is high quality and the ambient sound feature is better than I expected. A great set for those who want to listen to music or audio books as well as making phone calls.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-22,Beyond my expectations,Got my Samsung Galaxy buds plus today and tried them out and I was very surprised by the weight of them they are very light in your ears . The sound quality is great you have about 6 different options to choose from . I got the red Samsung Galaxy buds and oh yeah very nice
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-23,Quality is crazy,The best headphones I've ever had.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Worth the price for the fit and quality,"I have an issue with earbuds. They usually hurt or won't stay put for too long, and are heavy in the ear. AKG has so far made the only ones I like with the ones that come with the phones when you buy them (hardcore Galaxy fan here), but they're wired and I never thought I could get an earbud that I really liked. I saw AKG makes these and that was the selling point for me. I got them, immediately put them in and was not disappointed. They fit my small ears well. So let me list for you the pros and cons here so you can decide for yourself. PROS:
- Touch sensor: You don't have to push them harder into you ear by clicking to talk or pausing. - They fit perfectly so there is a good seal. - The ambient sound feature is great so you don't have to remove it to hear someone talk. - Wireless charging. - Good sound quality. -pretty good at canceling out outside noise. CONS:
- Not for audiophiles. While the sound quality works for me, the sound adjustment is lacking. Most options in the wearable app hurt my ears. - The ambient feature is great but I hear a slight ringing that makes me feel nauseous, like I'm getting a migraine."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Best buy!!!!,I use these when I walk or am on a long call. Great sound. Love them
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Great battery life,"Just what i was looking for, my other wireless ear pods from the apple company only lasted a couple hours and these have lasted hours on hours without having to keep charging them."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,1,1,2020-04-24,The headphone equvilant of a Tesla that can't go above 5mph.,"This is SO DISAPPOINTING!!! I bought the red version of the Buds + and they are gorgeous, comfortable, and easy to use!....BUT absolutely awful sound quality. I tried every sound option they have on the app, then tried them with my iPhone instead of my S9 and it doesn't make a difference. They just sound bad. Even comparing them to the free wired earbuds that came with my Galaxy S9 is a joke. These sound the same as the $5 knockoff pair my wife picked up on clearance from walmart. Ugh, I'm so disappointed. I don't want to get those stupid Apple ones with the stick hanging down. I might try the Bose ones next."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-24,Quality,"Samsung products are ALWAYS the top echelon of electronics, in my opinion! For the affordable price, you have a true wireless earbuds that far outlasts and outplays anything out there - especially the erroneously inflatedly priced Apple Air Pods and Air Pods Pro!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Better than the Jabra’s🙌🏽,"Battery Life: better than anyone 🌟
Light weight
Assorted colors to choose
Very nice compact design
Can be used independently ( right or left )
I love how the ambient sound it’s very useful and powerful👌🏽
Doesn’t have a noise canceling but with all those pros I don’t mind
Price very affordable and worth it. Highly recommended
iPhone user recommends it. Very comfortable to wear all day long Until the battery dies. 11hrs+"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,That battery life!,I got the red ones. The color is great. They sound pretty good will a decent amount of bass. The battery life is amazing. I can use them all day at work and and they don't die! They are supposed to have 11 hour battery life and they do. Buy these if you want good sound and long battery life. Highly recommend.
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Quality earbuds,"Fixed all the issues I've had with the galaxy buds. Sound is clearer, more bass, longer battery life in the case and buds, better mic quality for phone calls, but kept the same great design."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Buds+,Love it
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-25,Good product.,"So far so good, battery drops about 10% per hour on all max settings. So give or take ten hours of constant use under those circumstances. Love the color, like a hot rod. Looking forward to using these regularly."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-26,Great product,Exactly as described
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-26,I RECOMMEND! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!,"I absolutely love so much about these! Where do I start? The battery legit lasts about 11 hours. The sound has great quality. I prefer the bass booster setting. I love how the app allows you to modify the settings. When I first heard of ambient sound I didn't think I'd like it because it sounded weird. However, after using it, I love it! Being able to hear my surroundings without compromising the volume of the music is an incredible feature. The functions make it easy to switch ambient sound on and off. Lastly, even though they aren't noise cancelling, they block out nearly all sound. This is crazy because I only use about 50% volume. I highly recommend these!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-26,Great set of Earbuds!,"Love my new ""galaxy"" headphones. Sound is good but could be better for the price? Not enough bass and loudness but the mid and treble are crisp. I love the fact that they lock into your ear and wont fall off specially when exercising that's why I am keeping them. Other brands simply fall off or the sound is just not there. Love the unique color also!"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Best buy's I've had this year,I bought my wife a pair after I had mine for a week these are wonderful definitely buy again
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Great buy,"Just recieved mine and my husband's pair in the mail. Sound quality and noise cancellation is great. Can't say much about battery life due to just receiving them in the mail. Weird, we placed order at the same time on one account but my pair came with usps around 12pm. And his came through something called Dynamex and 5pm. The anxiety grew in me wondering why one came and not the other and two separate delivery carriers. But all went well thankfully. Highly reccomend"
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-27,Love them,Great sound quality
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-28,Quality for the price,"I've watched hours of YouTube reviews of earbuds to determine which ones were for me. I needed sound quality with a price under $200, decent battery life, and water resistant to a degree. Every video had positive results with the buds+. I am completely satisfied with this selection. Sound only lacks deep bass (as most earbuds do). Turning on the ambient mode offers hearing to your surroundings. You can make it a slight pick up of surrounding of noises to hearing your neighbor's conversation across the street. They're comfortable enough and don't protrude from your ears like other more expensive ones. Great earbuds."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Really nice earbuds!,I was skeptical about buying an expensive pair of ear buds without some sort of wire keeping them together. I did some research and chose the buds+ and really glad I did! They seem to be staying in my ear really nice and comfortably and the sound is amazing. I love the red!
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,4,1,2020-04-28,Not let down,"First day with these and I wore them 10 straight hours. No soreness, no discomfort, single full charge. Only a 4 on sound quality and noise cancel because...1 day. Looking forward to more ""testing"". AND...they came a day early! They come with 3 size fittings. Buy them and see for yourself."
Samsung,Galaxy Buds Plus,5,1,2020-04-28,Daughter loves it.,"My daughter wanted the iphone version because her sister has an iphone. But, she has a android. Ended up getting these as a gift, she never looked back, lol."
