Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-10,Better In Every Way,"A month ago, I bought a pair of the original Liberty Airs. I thought they were great but once the honeymoon phase wore off, problems became obvious. Ongoing connection issues. Weird battery drain. Pretty poor audio quality. Yesterday, I returned them and upgraded to the Liberty Air 2. The improvements are for real. CASE:
The case is slightly lighter and slimmer than its predecessor, with a more rectangular, pocket-friendly shape. It still features three battery status lights, now with a button on the bottom to check the charge without opening the case. It has a more matte finish and premium feel. And of course, USB-C and wireless charging. The lid magnet could be a touch stronger but not a big deal. DESIGN:
They completely redesigned the earbuds, now with slimmer stems, a matte finish and more solid feel. I actually thought I'd prefer the rigid look of the previous design but I was wrong. These look a lot nicer and more premium. SOUND:
I'm not sure if my previous pair of Liberty Airs was damaged, but I was constantly noticing rattling bass and tinny feedback. The Air 2 audio is noticeably fuller, the bluetooth connection is rock solid, and the customizable HearID feature actually works well. The difference between the two pairs is night and day for me. For context, I had a pair of first-gen AirPods. These sound better. The original Liberty Airs did not. TOUCH CONTROLS:
Unlike the original Airs, you can now customize your touch commands. They've also added volume controls, but you have to devote two different tap sequences if you want volume control (one for +, one for -) and give up something else (previous/next track/voice assistant). The touch sensitivity of the buds seems better but still a bit unreliable. The matte finish does feel a lot better to the touch, though. Removing an earbud pauses the music but audio doesn't resume when you reinsert the bud. That's kind of annoying, but the auto-pause is still a welcomed feature. BATTERY:
I'm only a day in but the battery life seems like it's significantly better and on par with Anker's estimate of 7 hours/charge. Maybe a touch less but impressive regardless. The battery level of my original Airs was all over the place and seemed to drain a lot faster than the promised 5 hours/charge. CALL QUALITY:
Huge improvement. Voice audio sounds much better and the microphones seem to pick up my voice well. Calls were a nightmare with my original pair of Airs. CONCLUSION:
The Air 2s are a significant improvement over the original Airs and an absolute steal."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-24,Stunning for the price.,"These a great headphones, battery life is stunning. Sound quality is really great. The case feels really premium. Call quality was crystal clear for all the calls I made, even with background noise. Once they are paired I find it really convenient to just take them out of the case and start using them. Bluetooth connection its really stable too. I have Airpods, Beats and Bose and trust me on these, the sound quality it’s fairly great considering the price. I feel really happy with these. The normal EQ preset on the soundcore app was like a flat EQ. Did not sound too great. But after setting the Hear iD EQ the sound improvement was really great. So I do recommend setting Hear iD. If you buy this you will not regret it. These can be a great airpods alternative at a really low cost compared to Apple. And Hey lets not forget about Anker’s outstading quality and customer service. These are a great buy overall."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-11-12,I wanted to like these but the sound quality was too tinny like the mids and highs were blasted...,"I really wanted to like these because they are nice and light, have a small light case and good touch controls. All this with USB-C and at a great price. However I am not sure if mine were defective, need a firmware upgrade, stuck in headset/call mode or are just not tuned correctly out of the factory but they sounded really bad. It sounded like the mids and highs were cranked up way too high. I tried using the app to change EQ settings but nothing helped. Back they go I guess. The Liberty 2's are still my favorite model and what I am sticking with for now."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-11-14,There's room for improvement here:,"Let's start off by saying that Anker/Soundcore customer service has been pretty responsive. I found it better to call than to wait for the 1 email per day from the service rep. Regardless, after a lot of time, my issue was resolved, and I got my original order... A month later. Unfortunately, the Liberty Pro 2's just aren't happening. Fast forward, I purchased the Liberty Air 2's and they are a much better product. They sound just as solid honestly and are way less bulky. The button controls need improvement. There is no single button press option which stinks. It would be nice to have that to play/pause and answer calls etc. That would leave the double tap for next/previous and long hold for Siri/assitant etc on an iphone. The charging case is confusing. I'd like to be able to have them in the case and not being charged continuously. That runs a battery down over time. If the case is closed, charging should cease and vice versa with charging continuing if the case is open. Or have a button to engage. There is a button on the bottom that could be coded to do this. The Soundcore EQ app. This leaves something to be desired. The user should be able to turn off the EQ or even manually control and customize a 10 band EQ & volume for each earbud. It's 2019. Fix the buttons, EQ, and charging and you'll have a 5 star product!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-20,Good product,I’m please with the quality and sound. Overall good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-25,Great item!,Great item!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-26,Very Good Sound,The noise cancellation feature was fantastic. My wife had to tap my shoulder to be noticed.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-30,Inexpensive Truly Wireless earbuds with SUPERB sound,"Sound quality is EXCELLENT! I mainly use my headphones for music during my commute & to take phone calls. The HEARID works perfectly to create a personalized sound profile. Robust bass, sharp treble, crystal clear voice in both music & phone calls. I have had Apple AirPods when I had iPhone, switched to Galaxy Buds with my S10+ & now using the Liberty Air 2's with my Google Pixel. Out of the 3 these get the highest reccomendation for sound quality & overall usability. Had a small issue at first getting both earpieces to connect which was resolved fairly easily & quickly with a reset. Will definitely look to soundcore for future Bluetooth headset needs. Great product for its value!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-01,Save your money on Apple-buds and get these for less. They sound better!,"The Soundcore 2's are nice and cheaper then that apple product that cost more and does not sound as good. well spent 90 bucks, and the EQ feature makes the buds sound even better!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-01,Better Than AirPods Pro's,"I will be doing a direct comparison of these headphones with Apple's AirPods Pro's because they compete against each other and I owned both. (And returned the APP.)
PROS
Excellent sound quality. Better than the APP. (Yes, seriously.) You can even tweak the EQ with their dedicated app.
Battery life is better than the APP with 7 hours in one charge and 28 hours total. Charging case is compact, wireless, and provides better grip versus APP case because it is matte plastic versus the shiny APP case. Black option means you aren't limited to white stems sticking out of your ears. Excellent microphone in my testing. No issues with any calls to date. 5 silicone tips versus the APP 3 means you have plenty of options to find your perfect size. Excellent stable bluetooth connection. Value, can't be beat. $100 vs the APP $250. CONS
No ability to seamlessly connect between multiple bluetooth devices, like the APP. You will need to disconnect and reconnect a new device each time if you want to switch devices. No Transparency mode. This is a great feature of the APP where you can have ambient sound leak in when desired and it's just not available with the Air's. Controls. A mixed bag really. You do gain the option for volume control. (Press for 2 seconds on the left bud to increase the volume, 2 seconds on the right to decrease.) However this is just one level at a time. So if you want to keep going up or down in volume you need to keep lifting your finger after 2 seconds and doing the action yet again. Still happy the option exists. But overall I think the APP win this category with their squeezing motion of the stems versus needing to double tap to play/pause or track forward. MIXED BAG
Some people will swear by the active noise cancellation of the APP. In my experience I found it overrated to be honest and if you get a proper fit with the silicone tips you will have plenty of noise isolation on that front. CONCLUSION
Unless you need to switch between multiple devices often or want Transparency mode, I strongly suggest the Liberty Air 2's over the AirPods Pro. Superior sound quality and $250 vs $100. An easy choice."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-01,"Versatile, lightweight true wireless headphones","These are the most comfortable true wireless headphones I've worn. Very light weight and easy to wear for extended periods of time. Sound quality is good, and the ability to use one piece at a time is extremely useful and versatile."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-03,ABSOLUTELY amazing,"I just got these and they are absolutely amazing so far. I had a little issue with pairing them but that was my mistake. The sound quality is exceptional. I work in a factory and they stay in all night and are very comfortable. The only thing I have noticed is that they DO NOT have a volume control. That is done by your phone/ipod or whatever. however, they still sound amazing. I would definitely recommend them to anyone
Update: I downloaded the soundcore app and you can change the way you push/hold the earbuds. I changed mine to volume control and it works better now that I can control the volume. These are still awesome. Highly recommend"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-03,awesome sound quality,"I'm satisfied with the sound quality. Fits well in the ear. The music stops on its own due to the sensor when removed from the ear
It's worthwhile collecting information for about a month."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-03,Awesome for phone calls,Really good for phone calls. Sound quality is awesome. I have had several pairs of wireless and these are by far the best ones I have owned! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-04,Amazing set of buds with a quick modification.,"These buds are pretty amazing but they weren't that way out of the box. The earbud tips that come with these are very unsatisfying to use and leave a lot to be desired with the sound. For me, the issue was a case of getting good coverage over my ear canal and none of the ear tips in the box worked. If only some foam tips were in the box. Standard foam tips don't fit inside the case on the buds. However, I was able to trim the tips to size and now they are amazing and probably my favorite set of earbuds I've owned. Foam tips make a better seal for me and feel more secure during any activity. I hope in the future Anker/Soundcore offers foam tips in the box because while the buds themselves sound great any set of buds will sound poor when they don't fit your ear well. The sound feels full and nothing ever feels distorted like in some buds. The inclusion of EQ settings is nice but I've had the most success with the custom EQ.
Build quality is fantastic. The matte finish of the case is a nice touch as well as the USB C charging port. It all feels sturdy with no connection issues so far. HOW TO ADD FOAM TIPS: Use some very sharp precise scissors and start with small removals of foam. I was eventually able to get them to the right size where they fit into the case perfectly while on the buds. I then used a very small amount of superglue applied to the inside of the foam tip and on the outside of the earbud where the tip rests. Make sure not to cover the speaker openings. Voila, you now have secure foam tips for your Liberty Air 2s that in my opinion make a better seal and let the great sound of the earbuds shine through."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-04,Good overall,Good sound quality and good battery life. Does not have noise cancelation
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-04,Good build quality and sound,Impressed so far (after two weeks). Build quality and sound are solid. Initial Bluetooth pairing took some research to learn that only one of the ear buds will show up as connected (at least on my rather outdated iphone).
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-04,Great earbuds for music,Great for music and phone calls
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-04,Constantly fall off ear,"Honestly these buds are amazing and work wonders, however they fall off constantly even after trying all the buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-05,Not many customization,Not that impressive not many customization options on the app you only get 2 taps to skip and hold to play and pause no single tap or triple tap maybe they can fix this in a update
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-05,Great if they fit your ears,I wanted to like these but they didn't fit well I my ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-05,A good product with very few compromises,"I got this product as a birthday gift and I have to say...I like it. The microphones on this product are great and I haven't had a single complaint. Connectivity is good, but there is a small complaint. There are times that the earbuds will not pair together, which happens only 20% of the time. I've also had an issue with static covering my music, but that happened once. Sound is decent, the earbuds could use a small volume boost along with the bass. But I gotta admit it's just me being greedy, I don't think anyone will have a big issue with the output. It's fairly close to airpod level. The battery life of the earbuds and case are impressive to say the least. I've had the earbuds a month, but I've only charged the case 3 times so far, and I use these buds daily. The earbuds themselves lasted about 6 hours of straight audio. It's great. With the right ear tips noise cancellation is great, but I have odd shaped ears so they took a minute to configure. Also, download the app!!! The adjustments to the sound makes for a better music listening experience. Overall, great earbuds for the price, and I'd certainly recommend them to anyone in the market for good wireless earbuds. Just beware of the small issues that may occur."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-05,Dont sleep on these!,I thought these had hear through feature... .........But besides that really great headphones for $100 better than what i was used before I like that you can use the right ear without the left ear for me....it was either a choice between these or the Razer hammerheads these won i recommend these
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-07,Disappointing,"The battery life and convenience of wireless was great but the sound quality left a bit to be desired. The bass was acceptable but the highs were a bit tiny, which wasn't really that much of an issue. The main issue I have is the hissing white noise that comes from them when audio is playing. It's not too bad with most music but it's very noticeable and annoying when watching a show or video on YouTube as well as when listening to a podcast. I also noticed that you have to turn the volume up a bit for a decent listening experience. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the product or just my specific pair, but I wasn't really impressed especially for the price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,0,2019-12-07,Worse than a lot of the cheaper options,"These are pretty all-around terrible. They sound awful unless you get a perfect fit. Speaking of fit, they'll either give you a headache after 5 minutes or fall out of your ears. It's one or the other. Oh and get ready to LOVE the hypersensitive touch controls when you try to re-adjust them in your ears. At least the battery life is quite impressive."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-07,Real review - I don't have any,"I bought the previous version of these ones, I'm not sure if it was a compatibility issues but I was having connection issue with it but the sound was great and great buds. Now I have the 2nd Gen, omg! These pair are amazing in every aspect for me, sound is excellent, awesome battery life, no connection issues, I can use one earbud if I choose plus if I remove one earbud then the system automatically pause whatever is playing on the headphones. By the way, if you download the app; you can control pretty much all of the settings: such as sound, EQ and even turn off the automated earbuds removal pausing system if you prefer. This is the best customer service from any headphones provider that I've ever received out of all of the headphones that I've purchased! You have my word, if you buy them then you won't be disappointed unless there's a compatibility issue but other than that, you'll be good to go."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2019-12-08,"I can hear you now, out of one ear.","4.3 stars? I'm not buying it. I have tried to get both buds to pair with no success. I tried on Android and I tried on Apple with the same result; only one ear bud pairs. I spent wayyyy too much time searching for a solution. I unpaired, I tapped, I held my finger on each bud one at a time following very exacting directions for how and when they should be in the case vs out. All with no success. I went to bed and woke up the next morning in hopes a new day would bring ""pairing"" clarity. Nope, same one-sided result. A bluetooth device should easily pair. Sadly, these don't. BTW, I enjoy other Anker products. I have multiple Anker charge blocks, cables, and car chargers. I have an Anker Viva Pro which I use daily and a Roav smart charger. Up until now, Anker has never disappointed. However these ear buds are beyond disappointing, they are frustrating. If you don't believe this review, Google something to the effect of ""Liberty Air 2 both won't pair"". Consider all of the various ""answers"" with no consistent solution. Do you really want to set yourself up for this level of troubleshooting over a pair of ear buds? Save you time and save your sanity. Steer clear of these until Anker figures out how to make BOTH ear buds seamlessly pair."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-09,Possibly Defective unit,"***update***: I tried to get a replacement but it didn't arrive (not anker fault) so I got a refund! However anker customer service was superb and pro consumer so if u have issues contact them. But my honest opinion is don't buy these unless u want this particular style, get the anker liberty 2 pro those are phenomenal in price and performance! They are not perfect but worth the buy over air pods and maybe even the Samsung Galaxy buds. *Please note this isn't a full product review due to the possibility of receiving a defective product (it happens) and it no way relates to fully functioning product, will return for a replacement*
So I'll say this off the bat I'm super suspicious about wireless Bluetooth headphones because one they don't sound as good as wired and don't even know if they ever will, they drain phone battery life and just lack innovation and not durable. I received my Anker liberty air 2 due to positive review from flossy carter on youtube. Pros:
- I love the aesthetic in terms of color (yes my favorite colors are black and red) it looks great and the red looks super cool inside the ear tip and bottom lining. -Bluetooth range was actually pretty good and i can be in the bathroom while my phone is charging in the room without it cutting off. -Sound quality as is (no eq settings) actually pretty good, I was surprised at how good they sounded for wireless tho not as good as my pc/ gaming audio Technica mx50 with an Aune amp/DAC. -the case overall looks very good and feels nice, not cheap plastic or flimsy, this also for the earbuds. - good selection of tips and nice ear tip holder. tho not sure about the right ones for me
- no jamming the earbuds in your ear when pressing the buttons. -No Video delay or lip-synching issues. -not overpriced trash like the apple air pros. cons:
-this one is subjective: don't like the apple air style of headphones tho these don't look as dumb and ghetto as the apple ones. - the eq settings on the app tho the preset settings are ok and do help make them sound better it would be better to keep those but also allow the user to mess with frequencies as actual EQs do. -no dedicated volume buttons: this is a must for me like yes u can use the app to change it but it is burdensome to do so and doesn't work well. the double-tap has a delay and the pressing down doesn't change the volume fast enough
-Left earbud cuts off from time to time worse on calls it happens frequently enough to be annoying. - on calls which is one of the main reasons, i got these people sound like my voice sounds muffled and echoes alot compared to my wired sony bass boost earbuds. -Also on call, i experienced distortion of the other person's voice and didn't sound great. - the touch buttons are a bit finicky and there should have more options or buttons to ad functions to
- no volume rocker one-star automatic knock off
-the ear fit could be alot better maybe ear tips with wings? it didn't fall off but does have a tendency to get loose alot
-No noise cancelation
-experienced alot of random pausing when listening to music"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-11,"Sounds good, fits badly","Pairing is a bit wonky, and the fittings are either too big for my ears to fit properly, or too small and fall out easily. However, they sound fine."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-11,Fits my ear perfectly,Tried a few wireless buds before landing on the Ankers. I should have started here as I loved my Anker wired BT buds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,0,2019-12-12,left side did not sync,left side did not sync
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2019-12-12,Of no use,"Earbuds are fragile and tear easily. None of the provided earbuds kept them firmly in my ears. Sensor that turns the sound off when the bud is removed only works on the right side. They are heavy, and it took very little effort to dislodge them from my ears. I wanted to like these. Very disappointed. Returned."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-13,Worth the purchase (after a rough start),"First the bad, then the good: When I first put these in I was underwhelmed, but now they're almost perfect! I have never used totally wireless earbuds before, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. The first time I used them I freaked out because the sound quality was awful, the left earbud disconnected a couple of times, and it also dropped during the first call I made with them. Once I had fiddled with them by taking them in & out of their case a few times to connect with my phone, that hasn't happened again and they both connect perfectly! Adjusting the EQ with the app & switching to different modes in succession helped with the sound. I think the EQ settings I had on my phone's music app must have affected my first listen. That, & as it turns out, the size of the little tips you put on the buds makes a BIG difference! My left ear hole is a little smaller than my right, and when I put a different size tip on that earbud, all of I sudden I had that booming bass I was looking for! So definitely play with those if you buy these, one size does not fit all. The sound is much better than any of my other headphones. Very crisp. I listen to a lot of electronic music & there tends to be lots of little subtle sounds in it, which I can hear perfectly with these. Good bass, too, as I've said! Call quality is ok, I guess. I haven't had any complaints from the people I have talked to, no weird echo or anything. I found it very useful the other day that I could just put in one earbud to use like a headset while I was driving & my car's bluetooth wasn't working. Plus my hands are almost always full getting in & out of the car so it's nice not to have to juggle my phone too. Just pop one of these in & put the phone in my purse; no more staying at the office or in the car until I'm finished with my conversation! So I would definitely say these are pretty great! I really just got them to use at the gym which they are PERFECT for. I do weight training and they absolutely stay put. I will say that I don't run or do any plyometric work but I bet they would stay in for some box jumps. Even though that's all I got them for, they haven't been relegated to gym bag status; I keep them in my purse because I actually use them a LOT! To me that's the biggest thing that says they were worth the purchase. And even if these hadn't adjusted well for me, I have read great things about Anker's customer service and I'm sure I could have exchanged them easily!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-14,Be patient when resetting the pairing.,"My first initial impressions were : nice packaging, very sleek design ( love the fact there is an option for black or white colored buds.) solid built and extra tips for optimal fit. I had issues getting both to pair together to my phone, watched numerous vids on the resetting process with no luck. I stumbled through the faq section here and found a reset that I hadn’t tried and it worked perfectly! After having both paired together I can say I feel these are worth the price an do in fact sound better than my ear buds that came in my iPhone 6 box. As far as longevity of product I can’t speak on that yet. I’ll update if any issues arise."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-14,Connection problems,"They kept disconnecting, and shutting off for no reason. Most or my calls dropped."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-15,"Good earbuds, great service after the sale","I wanted a set of ear buds with long battery life and good frequency response. These looked to be a good choice. I charged the phones and linked to my phone. So far so good. I installed the companion application and ran the setup process. All this was quick, easy and error free. I had some issues with the sound profile, so I contacted Anker. They worked tirelessly to solve my problem and ensure I had a great set of earbuds. Kudos to Anker plain and simple! These earbuds are costly, and if they don’t sound great the company making them should work with you to make it right. Anker does this!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-17,"Great sound and fit, cheaper than the well known competitor","These sound great and the fit was spot-on for me without trying out any of the other sized tips. Properly pairing them out of the box was an issue -- I didn't get audio out of both of them. After figuring out the pairing reset process they worked fine. Download the SouncCore app -- mine updated the firmware to fix bugs right away, and it has an option for tuning the sound to your specific hearing profile. I can't say much about noise cancelling, but the room has the eerie quiet sensation of noise cancellation, so I assume it works OK."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-17,GREAT EARBUDS!!!,"For the Price, I think the QUALITY and PERFORMANCE of these earbuds are really hard to BEAT!!!! They are lightweight, comfortable and pack a GREAT SOUND. I used Comply Replacement Earbuds to ensure a good fit
for me instead of the ear pieces that came with the buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-17,An outstanding set of earbuds,"Not perfect, but honestly pretty incredible for 100$. Battery life pretty easily gets me through my workday, assuming I take them out for 30 minutes every couple of hours for a quick charge during a meeting, and the sound is great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-18,"Great features and support, poor sound","Was looking forward to using this as the features were great. 7 hour battery life, Programmable touch gestures, Qi and usb-c charging, small case. But I couldn't get over the fact that the sound was just terrible regardless of how it's EQ'd, even with hearID. Had to return it. My QCY T5's sound way better than these. On a side note, these were a second pair as my first ones had a volume issue with the left earpiece. Anker support was great on that end, but that doesn't take away on how poor these sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-19,Call quality is really good!,After going through a few earbuds these hit the bullseye. I use earbuds for business so my top priority is call quality. These are very good. I've never heard what Airpods are but I was completely satisfied. I tried Cowin's latest because they were highly recommended but call quality was not there and out of 3 units there were problems with the earbuds themselves. These are highly recommended!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-19,Honest review from someone who's used a lot of headphones (updated),"Updated: I would give the product 3 stars (detailed review below) but Anker's customer service is so good that I would give them 6 stars, so average is 4.5 stars rounded to 5 stars. You'll need to find a product that's right for you, however, you can never go wrong with a company like Anker who takes so good care of its customers...
------------
Design and build quality excellent. No complaint. Durability we'll find out sooner or later. Battery life also exceptional, great job Anker. Call quality is great. In terms of noise cancellation, this is a closed design earphone without active noise cancellation, if you cant understand this, dont bother reading the rest of the review :)
Pairing with iphone xr was a disaster but I got it work using the ""putting them back to back"" trick...
My real issue is with the sound. My current wire headphones: Sennheiser HD598, Bose Soundtrue On-ear, Sennheiser IE80, Denon C710K, Creative Labs Aurovara Air (which I absolutely love more than any other), and Apple EarPods. My current wireless headphones: Airpods Gen1 (I lost one earbud which is why I bought the Anker); Sony WI1000X which I use for air travels. I'm not comparing this $89 pair True Wireless earbuds to the IE80s, which is obviously not fair. I'm also not comparing this with the Aurovara Air, which has a different design. The problem is that I dont know what I can use to compare. The resolution seems to be fine, with ""fake grains"" which is common in over-engineered headsets or speakers. The compression of bluetooth obviously didnt help either. The sound stage, well I dont know how to describe it.. it sank into the bottom of the ocean and can never be found. The real problem is that it doesnt matter which profile I pick out of the app, I couldnt get out a pleasant sound. Is the Apple Earpod superior when it comes to sound quality? Not really. However, it produces decent sound that you can listen to for hours and not feel like going insane. I think same thing applies to the BeatsX which has terrible sound but doesnt make you uncomfortable. The Liberty Air 2, unfortunately, didnt achieve that. When you try to get good sound of a budget headphone by over engineering everything, it usually doesnt end up well. The bottom line is - I'm keeping these because they are so comfortable and easy to use and have an in-ear design - which is what I absolutely need for my 3 - 4 hour daily commute - I dont want to spend $250 for the new AirPods pro and this is excellent for its price. However, I still want to write this review because what Anker (one of my favorite companies) claims to be ""rigid diamond-coated drivers produce sound with flawless accuracy"" is simply not true. The accuracy is terrible which is ok for this price point, just use a different angle to highlight the product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2019-12-20,"Sound great, work great, fall out","UPDATE: I've now tried just about every earbud ""replacement"" available. If you're like me and can't keep things in, try the Sport Earbud Stabilizers available here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WFK8KVJ . They're not perfect: they come as a 6-pack but all of the same size (3x left and right, each) so there's no custom fit. And they don't fit inside the Liberty charging case if you leave them on. That said they do hold these earbuds in my ear and they were a super cheap remedy. Maybe I just have a different ear shape than everybody else. These things get ""never fall out"" glowing reviews from other buyers. But for me they fall out. They're fine for a few minutes, but over time they slowly start easing out of my ear. I've tried EVERY tip size included and nothing helps. I wish they had an accessory available for this to add a tab or loop like some other brands offer to help hold them in your ear. I'm keeping them in hopes they come out with one, but not using them very much until then."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-20,Fit great and sound great - love them,"I have a hard time finding earbuds that fit well and feel good. These fit better than any pair I have ever used and feel great. I can hardly tell they are in my ear. I travel via plane often for work and these worked great. The sound was really good and, with the noise cancellation, I would hardly tell I was on a plane. They were so quick and easy to set up. I like how I can only use one of I want to keep one ear to listen while at the airport. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds for a good price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-21,great earbud,"great sound, just hope that the mono mode touch function can be customize."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-21,Great product and great price,"The battery life is amazing and the ability to change EQ settings through the app is great(I think acoustic sounds the best). I did have a hard time getting the two headphones to link initially, but with little research I figured it out and haven’t had a problem since. I would 100% recommend to anyone who is looking for solid wireless headphones without spending close to $200+"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-21,nice,Love Anker products and this headphones is fantastic. Being used for some time and great performance. Only downside is it does not have ambient mode.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-22,Amazing product,Looking for an alternative for the AirPod pro I think I found one in the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 the sound and features are amazing for half the price !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-22,Review,It’s been great using this.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-22,Great earbuds,Great sound and comfortable. Noise cancelation is almost too strong
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-22,So far so good,So far so good. Sounds great battery lasts quite a bit but then again I don’t use as much as I would like to so far. One thing though the touch button is that a sensitive but I think that will get some used to
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-22,Beyond expectation,the product is competitive with the well known brands with a reasonable price. highly recommended for the price and quality. except if you looking for studio sound quality will prefer boss and specialized product.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-23,Good item,It has a Very Good sound and mic but it disconnect always after get it outside the box to receive a call
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-23,Exceeded my expectations.,"The sound quality really exceeded my expectations. Keeping in mind they may not be as high quality in sound like other high end brand headphones but the quality it very good. Clear voice, heavy bass and the soundcore app EQ settings along with Hear ID really makes a difference. So far I've been getting very good battery life with moderate listening to music at mid to full volume."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-23,New pair working well,"Update 4/11/20:
I returned the original pair, but Anker ended up sending me a new pair to try out since I had such a poor experience. Their customer service continues to be great and is one of the main reasons I’ve bought many products from them. I didn’t have any issues pairing both earbuds this time around and they’ve been working great so far. Still not giving 5 stars due to the fact that I had so much trouble with them originally. But maybe they’ve updated them now so the issue has been fixed for all of them, I’m not certain. Original:
After trying to set them up for over an hour, I still couldn’t get both earbuds to pair at the same time. I have two other sets of Anker earbuds and haven’t had any issues with those, but they’re not designed to be able to work independently like the Liberty Air 2.
The ability to use the earbuds independently was one of the primary reasons I purchased these, but it appears Anker hasn’t figured out how to get these to pair properly. They will both pair to my phone at the same time, but music will only either play out of the left or the right earbuds at a time. In the Soundcore app, only one earbud will show up at a time. I have a degree in computer information systems and am really familiar with technology, so it’s extremely frustrating when a product doesn’t work even after following all of the troubleshooting steps. I’ve emailed Anker support so I’m waiting to see if I’ll have to return them or if they have alternate pairing instructions."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-23,Call quality,I have two sets of Jabra 65T and they do a great job but I have received numerous complaints about background noise during calls so I decided to give the Anker Liberty Air 2 a try and sure enough they live up to Ankers claims. Sound is good but I primarily use them for calls so I'm not expecting great sounds quality. The only challenge that I've had with these buds seems to be with the bluetooth connection. Occasionally it will seems to loose connection and there is a loud audible crack. It's not often enough to deter from what these buds do well but it is enough to mandate 4 stars instead of 5.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-24,Awesome!,They are awesome! Makes my gym workouts even better! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-24,HOT GARBAGE,"Not at all a true competitor to the AirPods or AirPods Pro. Sizzling highs, over pronounced bass, lackluster miss. The touch controls are clunky at best, and the app isn’t even worthy of being called clunky. I’m an Anker fan, I had really high hopes for these and they let me down big time. Oh, and don’t even think of using these for phone calls. Everyone I spoke with said it sounded like I was in a tunnel. Sending these back after about 8 hours of owning them. Total waste of time and money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-24,Good buds for everyday use,Limited touch controls which should be addressed in the next firmware upgrade
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-24,Work Great Outdoors For Phone Calls Using Iphone 11,"I picked these up for working outdoors for yard work and my job im outside a lot working construction sites. I tested these outside near the freeway, indoors using a fan for call clarity, no issues everyone I spoke to could hear me clearly. The sound is great, very close to the Liberty 2 Pro I own for use at home and gaming with my Xbox. These 2 work well for gaming on the Xbox and watching tv. Just know you must have a TV with Bluetooth connectivity to play xbox. I recommend these to anyone that want clear calls and easy touch controls on each side. Also, they can be used independently, the left ear works independently of the right and vise versa when one or the other is stored in the case."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-25,Expected delivery time 👍🏻,Product quality and delivery time frame meet all my needs thank you.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-25,Unacceptable Out of the Box Experience - If Left Ear Doesn't work READ THIS,"Bought 2 pairs for Christmas and took over an hour to figure out how to get sound from the left earbud. There are no instructions or help on the Anker website and the Youtube video instructions for reset don't apply to the Liberty Air 2s. I tried with 3 different iPhones and a MacBook Pro and could only get the right and left to work separately. FIX: Use the power button on the bottom of the charging case to reset the headphones. Hold for at least 15 to 20 seconds until the white turns red then turns blank or slow / dim white. The turn-on bluetooth. Horrible out of box experience but they sound pretty good at reasonable sound levels. I was super close to returning but Apple's fix worked on these. If they present problems in the future , I will update the review."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2019-12-25,"Wow, not a good wow either","I rarely post reviews but I bought these for my partner as a gift and am thoroughly disappointed. We just spent a half hour on Christmas morning trying to get both buds to pair with her iPhone 11 Pro... nope! What an awful experience, Bluetooth pairing should be the most simple aspect, basic day 1 stuff for a tech company. Can’t even speak to the sound quality or anything else because they can’t pair at the same time. Brutal, do not buy these, all the 5 star reviews must be fake!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-26,Good,Very good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-27,4.5 worth it!,"Great product for the value. Good sound, good bluetooth range, decent battery with good 10min quick charge. Things I didnt like, terrible instructions! Please only connect to one headphone then wait for the “pair” prompt to save yourself a ton of time and headache during setup. Also I do not love the touch controls; they are just too finicky. Aside from that I would never spend the extra money to justify getting apple’s version for the price of 2 of these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-12-27,Great,"Did not buy these on Amazon, I was lucky enough to get them for half the price, $50, due to a misprinted price at Walmart. These are the best sounding TWS earbuds I've ever used, the tips that came with it and there are five sizes oh, none of them fit perfectly the small ones are way too small and don't stay in my ears and the others are almost too big and create too much of a seal to the point where it actually distorts/muffles the sound but if you move them around to find, kind of perfectly position them they sound amazing. I'm glad I didn't have to pay a hundred bucks for them, but they are great! Very good but not overpowering Bass, and I swear I've heard sounds in songs that I didn't know existed oh, that's how good the range is on these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-27,Excelente compra,"Esta super genial, realmente es increíble como puede sonar de alto el volumen, es lo que mas me ha impresionado, el volumen es altísimo y lo mejor de todo, no pierde calidad ni se distorciona, con ayuda de la aplicación se puede configurar a tu gusto y antojo y el sonido es tan claro y nítido que es sorprendente, realmente es increíble la calidad que brinda, los compare en Android, entre un AirPod y estos y prefiero por mucho estos, su cajita es bastante compacta y me encanta que los auriculares sean de tapones, sobretodo estoy sorprendido con la calidad de sonido de brinda"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-27,review upgrade,"after spending 5 hours trying to pair both buds even looking at youtube video in trying to get left and right to pair simultaneously; which seems to be an issue with these buds I decided to send back for refund. Sound quality on one seem decent but could never get both to play at same time. therefore 2 stars 2/22/2020 after receiving another set of liberty air2 I was able to pair immediately and was just ""wowed"" by how well these earbuds sound the mids and highs are crystal clear and you can add as much bass as needed with the soundcore app I changed my star rating from 2 to 5. A MUST HAVE if shopping for great sounding buds"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-27,Good battery life,Love how long the battery last sound is alright
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-28,UPDATED***Issues Connecting Both Earbuds...like other reviews.,"UPDATE**** Anker responded to my support request after a few days and replaced the earbuds. The second pair seems to work ok but I’m surprised at the fact the first pair wouldn’t work which is unusual for Anker products. Seems the design is a little too complex. 4 stars for Anker support. Unable to pair both earbuds together. Strangest set of earbuds I’ve owned where both have a Bluetooth to pair with in your phone. Even with both paired it only plays out of 1 ear. Cannot get both to play music. I’ve tried with multiple phones and no luck. Such a strange, overly complex design by Anker which usually has rock-solid products. Emailed support but still haven’t heard back, maybe due to the holidays. Save your money and buy another brand."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-28,Great for the price.,I love these. Work well and the price is even better. Not great if you are going to be using them while working out.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-29,Three Stars,"The audio quality is FANTASTIC. But, the touch controls are so sensitive that you can't even adjust the earbuds positioning without accidentally stopping the music, skipping to the next track, or opening up Google Assistant. No thanks."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-29,Major improvement over gen 1,"Major improvement over the 1st gen, showing that Anker really listened to community feedback. USB-C, Qi Wireless charging and amazing sound at an amazing price. My only criticism is that the matte black case is a finger print/oil/scrape magnet, but that’s pretty standard for the type of finish. Just know going in that the case is going to wear a bit in these ways and that it isn’t defective."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-29,Comfortable true wireless,"The Anker Liberty Air 2 wireless earbuds are a very solid choice for ""non-Air pod"" listening. I have been crushing cheap wired headsets for years now, and I finally got fed up. Too many times a cord snatches on something while I'm working, and the earbuds become broken and useless quickly. I have a Galaxy S9+ and it did take a few tries for it to pair as 2 separate bluetooth audio devices. I have had the opportunity to listen to them in paired stereo mode, as well as each individually, and the sound is better when the Liberty Air 2's are connected separately. That is my opinion. Not only does the true wireless eliminate that, they have good enough technology where they don't sound like complete crap. As for phone calls, it's no worse than using a Plantronics Voyager headset, which was my go-to until I wanted dual-purpose headphones. The mics are using the latest technology, and they do a good enough job. In a quiet environment, they're perfect (while driving, etc.). I can see how when there is a lot of background noise, that they won't be perfect, but at this price range, I'm not expecting miracles. The miracle for me is how comfortable they are in my ears. I actually forgot I was wearing it today. (was using 1 bud for most of the day). Pros -
- Comfortable for me
- Good enough sound with Bluetooth 5.0 and updated aptX
- Good battery life
- Case is convenient and feels good to pocket. - Virtual Assistant is easy to use. Cons -
- Sounds soft if in ""paired stereo"" mode
- Gestures aren't great, integration not as seamless as AirPods
- Documentation and quick start guide are not easy to follow. - Prepare to have to watch a video or 2 about pairing these. TL;DR
These represent a strong value for the price paid. I would definitely recommend them to someone who's looking for a ""true wireless"" experience, likes the silicone ear bud style, and isn't going with AirPods or AirPods pro."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-29,Great,Great quality; great sound; easy to connect; stays in ears; good value for money.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2019-12-29,Not good,Ours was broken and missing pieces
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-31,"Awesome sound, cool features, waaay cheaper than AirPods","Not sure about those handful of people having issues but these ear buds, sounds great, look great, and wok great. The app even comes with a hearing test to properly calibrate them for your ears and a load of preset equalizer settings. Worth the money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-31,Not what I had hoped for,Not enough bass. Pairing is often a challenge
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-12-31,Excellent feature set for a great price,"Compared to today's true wireless sets starting at around $150 and easily into the $2-300 range, these are great alternative if your open to trying out new brands. Anker has been pretty solid with their Apple accessories for a few years now, and this is no exception. For $100 (or less if you can get a deal on them) you get diamond coated drivers (similar in tech to B&W drivers of the high end 800 series) Wireless charging along with USB C. Very good bass and excellent high end ranges. The mids are a little muddy and withdrawn but not enough to make this a bad product at all. I ran a frequency test and got from about 24hz to 13khz. At least that's what this old guy could hear. The device does run a bit hot when running on a wireless (Qi) charger, but I'm gonna chalk that up to tight quarters in a small enclosure. USB-C may be the way to go for charging (cable included)
Overall I would give this a 4 1/2 star review for the price point. And look forward to their next version release ! **Update**
After using for a couple of weeks the mids do start to warm up a little get a little nicer in the mix. Just one step closer to that 5 star rating. Still runs hot on the wireless charge so maybe stick with the USB -C charging"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2019-12-31,Wanted to like this,"I was initially really excited when I got the package but it just went downhill after that. - The pairing was a pain. I followed the instructions but for some reason it would only play one or the other... never at the same time. On the rare occasion that it did work, my calls would drop randomly or music would randomly stop. - Sound was surprising okay when it was working. The person in the other end was able to hear me clearly even though I wasn't talking all that loud. My only issue was that I kept getting dropped calls. I really wanted to like this product. I really the other Anker products I have but unfortunately, this did not live up to the expectation I had. Maybe I faulty one but honestly... I'm too lazy to go through the return process for this."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-31,The best earbuds hands down!,"Hands down the best earbuds I have tried for phonecalls. Usually something has to give: phone calls or the music quality, but not here. Sound quality is amazing, phonecall quality is awesome. I use it for phone calls for the most part, but every time I listen to music, it puts the smile on my face from the quality of sound. Highly recommend those earbuds. Battery life is superior and the build quality is very good. Connection from one earbud to two, or to the other one is seemless. I have tried all the other earbuds from the soundcore lineup, those were the best overall."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-01,If you have ANY issues with this style of earbuds...,"They won't stay in my ears. To be fair I typically always have SOME issues with this style of ""rubber ring"" earbud, but these are by FAR the worst. I've tried every size on the box. Unless I sit perfectly still they won't stay in my ears. Forget about exercising, walking, talking, smiling... existing. I feel like I wasted my money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-01,"Multi-point no, but two phones is possible. One earbud per phone.","For those that are looking for multi-point earbuds, these are a good option. I tried a few different types but was specifically looking for one product to use seemleasly on two cell phones. After months of searching I decided to try these because each ear bud has full functionality on their own. I simply set up one earbud for my personal phone and the other for my work phone. Setup was easy, just took out the earbuds one at a time, alternating putting the phone in pairing mode. Sound quality is great. I primarily use these for phone conversations but I also listen to audio books, so therefore I cannot provide feedback on how music is in just one ear versus both. The battery life has been great and they are certainly comfortable. I'm very pleased with this product!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-02,"GET THEM NOW, DONT WAIT BECAUSE... IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC FOREVER!!!!","I don't usually write reviews.... However these earpods are just that AWESOME!!!! USPS sucks and while these were ordered on the 14th of Dec and shipped out the 15th, they have been in transit until today. They finally arrived and I was so excited to try them. Out of the box they both came fully charged and case 70% charged. NICE!!!! I turned them both on and they paired right away with my Android phone. No hassle or struggle what so ever. Downloaded the app as directed.... connected my device to app and I was ready to set up customized button options for both earpods as well as customized EQ settings for music. THE HEARING ID PROGRAM IS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!!! It will change your life for real! the earpods are duable, light weight, and stylish.... as well as several options of earbud tip sizes to fit ANY ear. THESE EARBUDS FIT PERFECTLY IN MY EAR.... SECURE AND EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE. I could actually probably forget I had them in. Made a call to my wife to test call sound and noise cancellation.... it was absolutely fantastic! she couldn't hear any background noise and I actually had to turn volume down a bit bc her voice came through so clear and loud. I work for FedEx Express and I absolutely need these for work.... without them my days would be almost impossible. also another great trait of these earbuds, is that each earbud can be worn and used for calls and music separately, allowing me to keep one ear open to my surroundings and what is going on around me at all times. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING PURCHASING THESE EARPODS AND ARE ON THE FENCE.... I URGE YOU TO DO IT, IT WILL PROBABLY BE ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES YOU HAVE EVER MADE.!!! U will not be disappointed with these as the quality of product and sound is well worth way more than this price!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-02,great sound quality,very satisfying product. amazing sound and great design.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-02,Great sound,"Pros:
Small and protable
Long range
Great sound
Good app
Cons:
Case is flimsy
Overall these have been a great set of wireless earbuds. They have exceptional sound and after tuning them with the available app the Sound was even better. The Bluetooth connectivity has been extremely solid with good range from my devices. My only complaint is that the case is a bit flimsy, as the top is easily opened luckily the magnets that hold the buds in place are pretty strong."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-02,Hands down unbeatable quality and sound,Some of the best airpods I've ever had... the comfort and sound is crystal clear. I bought these earbuds to use mostly as hands-free devices while talking on the phone but the sound is so incredible I use it for my music as well. Incredible highs lows and mid-range sound. If you're looking for an all-around Air Bud with comfort easy connection and outstanding sound these are your earbuds
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-03,Would definitely recommend. Will buy again,My 25 year old and my 12 year old love them. They especially like that it pauses automatically when 1 pod is pulled from either ear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-03,Trash,These are trash. They don’t even pair together. I only get to use the left or the right. Not at the same time.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-03,The best bluetooth earbuds possible,Upgraded from airpods to these and wont go back any time soon.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-03,No good. Buy monster ear buds instead.,"Won’t pair with iPhone 8. The chinaman that built them have no answer. Steer clear of these, lame issue they aren’t smart enough to figure out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-03,Call quality is amazing no matter if you're using the left or right ear piece,Noise cancellation for phone calls is amazing. I have yet to get a complaint from someone who can't hear me over the outside noises even though I've been in noisy coffee shops and outside I'm busy streets.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-04,Great quality for the price,Great sound quality
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-04,Nice pair of buds,Best ear buds i ever bought! Definitely worth the money!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-04,Hard to sync but otherwise great,"Difficult to pair left and right earbud without the proper instructions given which is under their website, Anker YouTube videos given are helpful. Good earbuds otherwise so far."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-04,Frustrating,"I didn’t get to enjoy em, bc I couldn’t get the buds to play at the same time. I look online for troubleshooting and earphones still didn’t paired together"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-04,Can’t beat them for the price I don’t think.,I can’t imagine paying more for a set of ear buds...they work well with my iPhone.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-01-05,"With some improvements and updates, they can compete with Apple",Has glitches of connectivity. Need to update the connectivity issues.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-05,Fantastic earbuds and sound,Everything so far about these Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds is amazing. I've been enjoying everything Anker has been putting out lately for sure.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-05,Very pleasantly surprised by how well they sound.,It took a bit to connect both earbuds at the same time to my phone due to the picture instructions. Maybe folks can’t read anymore but I still prefer written instructions; but once setting it up I was blown away by their performance. Sound quality is quite impressive. They have rich bass and clear highs. They fit great as well. You can’t beat them for the price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-05,If they only didn't fall out.,"There is a lot to like here, the rechargeable battery case, the long life, the excellent sound plus mics. There are some problems however. I realize that a 'touch' based button system would help reduce the profile and allow more battery life, but it also means that things routinely cause it to pop off (say if you're wearing a rain hoodie). But the biggest problem is it's tendency to fall out. I've used a lot of earbuds, I haven't had this problem except with this one. I don't know. I've used all the various air bud sizes, but it still occurs. It mostly occurs when you're not absolutely 100% upright, it seems to be totally gravity centered. If I bend over a little bit, it falls out. That's a problem. They also slowly begin to fall out on their own, after time. That's kind of a pain. If only they worked for my ears."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-06,Not worth buying.,Worked ok for 2 or 3 days then it kept disconnecting from phone. I returned it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-06,BEST BEST Choice at the BEST Budget,The product is simply Awesome... Sound Quality is Great but not like Bose of course. I compared to Apple airpods 2 and it was way better. The battery life and wireless fast charging is very good. Sound Quality. I am in love with the product myself. Anker and Proud 👌🏻
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-07,Update the firmware,"To start I have been using this product for about a week. I read a lot of reviews for this product saying only the left or the right earbud would connect. I’m assuming these are a very new designed earbud. Update the firmware first thing and there is no issue. I had no issue before the update but it doesn’t hurt to still do it. The sound is to die for, I would say for $99 it is to be expected that they should sound good. The case is very nice and sturdy, wireless charging is an amazing feature. You can just throw these on a wireless charging pad at night and not worry about more wires. I saw someone say that the case would constantly charge the earbuds to the point the case would die, this is not the case. The earbuds turn off when placed in the case and closed. I left the case off the wireless pad for a a night and day, the charge percentage did not change. As for noise cancelation, these fit very snug which is something I always struggled with. It comes with many more sized tips. You should be able to find the right snug fit for you. I would recommend this to anyone willing to spend $99 on wireless earbuds and don’t want to go with the $150 model. Amazing buy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-07,Awesome for the low price!!,Sound quality is great! Can be well over 75ft away from phone and still have the music playing. Very nice ear buds! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-07,Great product,I brought these for my boyfriend to replace the other ones that broke. He uses them everyday.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-07,"Great fit and battery life, work well separately","For me, fit, battery life and the ability of the earbuds to work independently, one at a time (L or R) were critical factors in deciding which earbuds to buy. From this perspective, these earbuds are excellent. Zero complains. Sound/voice quality is good, but not spectacular. I am very happy with my purchase, fair price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-08,"Decent sound, great fit.","These were decent earbuds, but I couldn't get over the slight fuzzy sound that was ever present in the background. I'm no audiofile, but wanted good fit and good sound. The fit was great, but the sound was only decent."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-08,Earbuds too large for small ears and pushing them back in activates a touch action,"Three and a half stars, rounding up. I like them a lot, especially for the price! Maybe it's an edge case, but if you have small ears and call quality is very important, I'd consider passing on this. I want to start off by saying that the sound quality and range of these is awesome. A lot of people choose TWE for the sound quality, but I chose this first for calls. The mic works great! Sometimes better than my normal phone mic (I speak somewhat softly). Everything else works pretty well for me (pairing, sound, etc), but the problem for me is that since even the smallest earbud size is a little too large for me, it's only a matter of time before these fall out (for reference, the bud size is probably closer to a medium Panasonic Ergofit bud). Usually I feel them about to fall out so I can catch them/they stay on my ear but the seal breaks and if I'm listening to media, the media gets paused. If I'm on a call, then that bud stops playing the call audio. Not a problem if I'm just listening to something. However, if I'm on a call and I try to put it back in my ear, unless I'm pretty careful, somehow the motion of putting it back in my ear often drops the call. Okay but not preferable for me with calls to friends/family, but if I was using this for more business calls... I might switch to a different TWE."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-09,Work great. Solid for price point.,"Price point driven purchase. Don’t have others to compare, but very happy. Would buy again."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-09,Custom EQ Now On App !!!,"I rarely write reviews, but these earbuds are exactly what I hoped they would be. Something that is pretty rare. Battery life: Incredible. I can get a whole day of work out of them easily. I throw them in the case for a few mins during lunch and the buds never get below 60% all day. Comfort: Fits well in the ear and I forget they are there. Many tips come with them so the ear fit is perfect. Connection: Solid with no delays or dropouts. Phone calls are crisp and people tell me I sound clear. Music: This would have been my only concern since out of the box the audio signature is extremely bright and the stock EQ choices didn’t allow much to tune that out. However, the developer just updated the App and now you can tune a custom EQ. I immediately dropped the ultra high bands a bit and the sound is now rich and full. Zero complaints now."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-09,DO NOT BUY,No. Just no. Read everyone else’s review about pairing issues. We tried 2 iPhones and 1 droid. Only right ear would pair. I’ve never had so much trouble pairing a Bluetooth item before. Way too much time spent and no solution. This was a waste of time and money. I wouldn’t keep them if they were free.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-10,Time spent trouble shooting vs using = 3:1,"I've spent 3x the time troubleshooting the TWO sets of Liberty Air 2s than using them (one was a replacement). I bought these to 1) using for making and receiving phone calls, and 2) as a wireless audio headset. The first set had trouble pairing initially. When I finally got it to work, the Android app forced me into a firmware update, which failed repeatedly. I must have tried a dozen times, waiting until the progress got to 70% or so, afterwhich it would error-out. Finally called Anker and they said that they needed to replace them (another two day wait). The next set also had pairing issues. Although both side would pair, only one would connect at a time. Finally figured out how to do a factory reset, which solved that problem. However, then the mics would not pick up my voice or cut in and out on calls. I do a lot of my business on my phone. So, this is obviously totally unacceptable. Just for kicks, I called Anker customer service again using the buggy buds. Although the agent was very pleasant and trying to be helpful, they poor performance persisted, even on the support call. I'm done! P.S. - The sound quality for music was just ok, and for calls and spoken-word (like audiobooks) it was very good. Too bad the execution is so poor."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-01-10,Im about sound and sound quality,"So far, so good...they will go nice and loud..the app has many EQ options..battery seems to be good.. impressed by the individual sound check....left side went out for a day,but came back and im still down for these buds......"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-10,Great all around value.,"I’m very happy with the overall performance. The sound is rich and full. It doesn’t do too much for noise canceling, but I don’t think it was designed to do that. I have an IPhone 10 and I haven’t had any issues with connectivity"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-10,Great Sound,"Work as advertised, great battery life. They take a little fiddling to get them to stay in your ear but they stay once they are in properly. The Bluetooth 5.0 connection is strong and I never get any dropouts unless I go halfway across my house. They connect to my phone as soon as they start up. Great AirPods alternative."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-10,Great earbuds,"I love these headphones. They fit, they sound good unless you're playing them at a volume loud enough to kill your ears, and they last forever. But they fall out unless you take the time to find a tip that fits your ears. I'm currently using the smallest size and it fits perfect. I get about 5 hours of playtime before the right ear starts to die , because Bluetooth requires the right ear to broadcast the left ears data, and then I can keep going by swapping to the left ear for another few hours. The mic quality is pretty good too."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-11,Best bang for you buck!,Killer sound quality at the right price
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-11,Excellent product!,"Sounds better than the airpods, galaxy buds, excellent fit, will not fall out of your ears, awesome music app, under 100 dollars, best money I spent,wireless charging, buy them! Water proof, good for the gym!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-11,Too good to be true,"Great sound, BUT mine came out defective. They sometimes connect. And I have to be playing with my bluetooth settings turn them on and off SEPARATELY! They do not connect right away as the reviewers say. Sometimes one ear piece works and the other turns on but my phone can not find the other when I scan for devices. In the video the left ear piece is looking for a device to connect but can't be found on my Galaxy s10+"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-11,Surprisingly high quality product,"First of all, I paid $80 for these. I have Airpods too. If you use one set of earbuds paired with only one device, then these are hands down the best quality in built and sound, no questions. But I notice these Liberty Air 2 are hard to connect with multiple devices. So in the connectivity department, Airpods wins all day long. For the price, with a equalizer app, great sound even without noise cancellation, this is a must buy (if you don't mind the connectivity issues)"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-11,Zero Star Waste of time and $$,"What is the most basic function of headphones, assuming you have two working ears? It is to be able to hear sound out of BOTH sides at the SAME time. This product fails this most basic test. Right ear don't pair with left or vice versa. The fact that there are known problems should have been a factor in the CNET reviews that steered me to this crappy product. I know there are videos to try and fix the pairing issue. My point is that this shouldn't be an issue. Would you wear glasses where you could on see out of one eye at a time? They should get the basics right and then focus on extras"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-12,Better overall than the original Liberty Air.,I have the original Liberty Air and loved the overall quality however background noise made it almost impossible for the person on the other end to hear when I was anywhere but a quiet room. The four mics with uplink noise cancellation on the Liberty Air 2 solves the problem. The sound quality is superior as well. I also like the app but the Hear ID is a bit of a gimmick. Nice try though. Battery life is awesome on both models. Charge time is excellent. I find that with the right ear tips they are comfortable for hours of use. I hardly feel I'm wearing them. Sound quality when listening to music is slightly better and they have deeper bass than the original Liberty Air. Mine are with the black finish and I love them. I gave the white original Liberty Air to my wife. She is pleased with them and I have to say both are a bargain for their price. The key to either of these is in finding the ear tips that fit.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-12,Great product,"Great product, used them more for work, between calls and listening to music last pretty good about almost 5 hrs from full charge on 1 bud, connect pretty fast, controls are pretty smooth. Good sound, have app for sound customization, smooth controls overall. Love the black finish."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-12,Quality product with meh sound,These earbud are really nice.....to hold. Fit and finish are really high quality feeling. Unboxing experience is almost apple/samsung quality. Charging case is a really nice matte finish. Magnetic case is really satisfying to pop open and closed. Sound quality on the other hand.......they kinda hurt my ears. For some reason they have this weird boomy effect no matter how much you play with the eq. I started with a flat eq and they were boomy. Not just bassy but like very harsh boom that made me feel like there was alot of pressure on my ear canals. Moved to the bass reduction eq and still the same exact boom. Did a custom eq with everything on -6 and still the same exact boom but with every other frequency playing at a low quality. No matter what i do it has that boom. Im using the smallest eartips that the kit has. Not sure if its just the natural sound that these buds make but im definitely returning this even though it was so nice. Highs seem to be muffled even if i amplified them. They were there and clear sounding but seemed like something was missing.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-13,Best Earbuds for the Price!,"These are great! Easy to connect, just follow the instructions provided, very simple. LOUD sound! Best buds for the price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-13,"Excellent headphone, great sound and fit","So far I used it to listen music and videos, very good quality of sound across all ranges without using the equalizer app. With the piano equalizer, the sound improves a little in the mid-low frequencies. The fit is nice using the earpad that came with it. The case is also nice in quality build and apperance. Noise cancellation is pasive, so it will depend on the individual fitting. I have not use the mic a lot to actually make an assessment. The times I used it was ok. Personally I am very happy with the earbud. Only cons is the price, $60 would be more in line with mid price competitors."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-13,Soundcore 1 : Airpods 0,"More battery life and equal sound quality to airpods without the hefty price tag. If only they would add a little through vent to get rid of pressure in the ear, these would be the absolute best. It's not a deal breaker, but would be guaranteed win over airpods if it did have the vent. They may look larger than airpods in the picture, but no noticable bulkiness in ear when compared to airpods. Thanks so much!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-13,"Decent headphones, mediocre fit","Sound great
Touch controls are irritatingly touchy
Fit is mediocre - they do not stay in your ear. We returned them"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-13,Not worth the price,"This is NOT a good replacement for apple airpods. There is one pro and too many cons with these. The pro is battery life - case lasts for days, and I haven't had a chance to fully discharge buds. The cons: might hurt ears if worn too long. Sometimes might fall out depending on your ear shape. Really bad controls: only tap, double tap and hold is supported. No way to change volume other than on the phone or via Google assistant. Controls work even if your bud is out of your ear which is ridiculous. You take a bud out to talk to someone and while holding it you start your music. I haven't noticed any noise cancellation. The mic is below average, people couldn't hear me. To sum it up: not worth $100."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-01-13,Really Great Headphones,"Let me start by saying that I'm VERY picky with how my headphones sound. I want them to be as close to reference as possible (I'll make EQ adjustments myself), and that I've held onto my wired headphones (MEE M6 Pros) because I've been skeptical of the sound quality from Bluetooth ones. I primarily listen to music using my iPhone 8 and as of late i need the convenience of truly wireless headphones. I'm very impressed with the Liberty Air 2 headphones. They are very clear, well balanced, and the dynamic range is impressive. I wish the soundstage was a little deeper, but it's certainly not a one dimensional sound. There is no lag or delay while watching video content. My favorite feature is the Soundcore app. The HearID option is really cool if your hearing is a little messed up -- it runs a hearing test and then based on your feedback, it'll adjust the EQ to compensate for any frequencies you don't hear very well. They also just updated the app a few days ago to provide an 8 band manual EQ if you want to really customize your experience past the 20+ presets they provide. The touch controls are nice. I'm not a big fax of using them, but it is nice that you can customize what the various touch patterns do (again using the app). Noise isolation performance is completely based on how well the silicon ear tips fit. You get some conical shaped ones and spherical, both in varying sizes. The spherical ones fit me just fine and do provide a good amount of isolation. When I wear them while shopping in noisy places like Costco, I can barely hear anything around me, which is a good thing and a bad thing. I find that I have to be more vigilant of my surroundings, so depending on how you plan on using them you want to pay a little more for ""hear through"" type features. The battery life seems good. I've only used them for an hour straight and I saw a battery drop of a few percent. I can't say whether you'll really get close to the 7 hour life as advertised. Phone calls (super important to me) are good. People say I'm clear but that I do sound a little distant. They don't have a problem understanding me, I just sound different compared to when I use my wired USB headset for phone calls. Overall, I think these are worth buying if you want high quality audio and the option to customize things. They are comfortable and fit securely, and are well worth the price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-13,one of best option to use with android,"only airpods pro better in some aspects like for example isolation from noice or MIC
but to make apple products working with android you will need to install 3rd-party apps while with these official app works perfectly
definitely recommend"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-13,Worth every penny,They are much better than I could of expected. Great sound and even better battery life.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-14,Great product and support for the price!,"Great sound. Some initial connectivity confusion on my part but easily resolved with online product support team in only a few minutes, so high marks with customer support as well. Overall, extremely pleased."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-14,Awesome,Great sound quality and noise cancellation. Recommend for someone not wanting to spend $200 for true wireless earbuds
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-14,A great everyday pair of truly wireless headphones,"These headphones are great for everyday. I did not find these headphones to work well during a work out or a run. But these are perfect for the person that love listening to music or podcast as you are walking about or at a desk. I use these mainly while I am at work since I do not have to have both headphones in at the same time. There are some very neat features and some features I found to be lacking. The main pros (in my opinion):
- the battery life!! I can use these during my work day and they will keep going long into the day, they will die by the end of a 9 hour shift, but if you charge them on your lunch hour, then they will without a doubt last the rest of the shift. - wireless charging. It is definitely convenient. I was able to get it to charge on the samsung wireless charger stand if you have the case upside down. (See the pictures)
-the ambient light sensor. This is probably one of my favorite features! When you remove one of the headphones from your ear, it will automatically pause the music. It definitely has spoiled me. - the phone sound quality. I know some reviews have bashed these for the sound quality, but I have had no complaints, especially over phone calls. -the auto connect when opening the lid. I found this feature to be somewhat annoying at times since it is just a fun lid to open. But if you are listening to music on another bluetooth device, it will stop that music and start playing over the headphones. -the ability to personalize the sound quality. -the ability to update the software through the app.
The main cons (in my opinion):
- the soundcore app. I like the ability to update the headphones, but I feel like it could have added so many more options to customize the headphones. (This could be changed through an update)
- both headphones must be out of the case in order to take advantage of the customized controls. I would like to be able to have customized controls when only one ear but is out. -they do not stay in well during a work out or run. Overall these are some pretty incredible headphones and have become my favorite headphones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-15,I luv em!,Awesome sound#
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-15,Worth it!,"This are worth every penny. They are loud (sometimes too loud) and with the 4 mics, calls are crystal clear. Glad I bought this instead or airpods. Same quality and I got to save my money!! Worked out in the them and they did not fall out. The battery hasn't died on me yet but I also only use them for hours at a time."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-15,GREAT sound and call quality,"First pair of truly wireless earbuds. LOVE THESE. I researched at length before making a purchase. Was leaning AirPods until I found multiple reviews on tech websites that rated the Liberty Air Pro 2's as being superior to the AirPods for call quality. As an outside sales rep, my primary reason for wanting these was hands-free calling when working remotely. After using for the past couple of weeks I have had positive feedback from those I've spoken to over the phone while using them. I did have a minor issue pairing them at first - only one would pair at a time - however, I looked at the instructions that mentioning to try resetting if there are issues. After resetting, they paired fine. I have been very pleased with the quality of the product itself, both the buds and the case, as well as the performance. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a GREAT option for truly wireless earbuds at an even better price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-15,Great alternative to AirPod Pros,"Our son wanted AirPod Pros for Christmas, but they were way to expensive. A friend recommended the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2. Currently, we use many Anker products , so we thought we'd give them a try. They work great, our son is quite pleased and I especially like the black colour as they don't stand out like the AirPods do."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-15,"Very pleased with the quality, design, and sound","I bought these earbuds for my husband for his birthday. He needed them primarily for phone calls, but also for listening to music and podcasts. I did tons of research and settled on this pair because of the excellent call quality, the fact that it comes with multiple sizes of silicone tips, and the overall sound quality reviews. He is very pleased with the quality and features of these earbuds! I have a pair of AirPods and I actually like these Anker earbuds better than mine. Because Airbuds (non pro version) don’t have silicone tips, the fit is a bit awkward and they sometimes fall out or the sound quality is compromised. I would definitely recommend the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds- very good quality, design, and customizable fit. One note- my husband did have to sync them a couple of times using specific instructions we found online in order to get both earbuds to sync the first time; after that, he has had no issues at all."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-16,Great Value Overall,"Excellent sound quality when listening to music. Also excellent for phone calls, unless you are outside on a windy day. Top quality build. A great value overall."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-16,For the money it's really good,They sound good. But the the connection keeps on going on and off on one of the buds. For a second then it turns back on. Sometimes it wouldn't sync at times. But for the money it's really good..
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,0,2020-01-17,Overpriced; many other equivalent or better alternatives,"First off, I'll start with the positives; even if they don't validate the $99 price tag. -Charging case is solid and has a premium feel to it. It also takes usb-c. -The buds seem to have solid build quality (so far), and I haven't had connectivity issues. However, they do not readily sync as well as similar buds I bought for half the price. Now to the negatives..
-TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY. Despite the 'diamond coated drivers' , I can't get over how bad these things sound. I've had numerous cheap headphones over the years, but something about these makes them especially grating to the ears unlike anythinf owned before. As another reviewer said, its like the mids and highs are boosted x100, and their software e.q. doesn't fix this. The buds sound like you're blasting music on your iPhone 4 speaker from 30 feet away, recording it with another iPhone 4, and playing that recording back. -call quality: while the main reason I bought these was for the advertised call quality with 4 imbedded mics, people have reported I don't sound much better on these than I did on my $40 Taotronics pair. They report a lot of background noise and distortion. -Comfort: My $40 Taotronics headphones where more comfortable than these and did not fall out as easily. These headphones, for $99, fall prone to unwanted sound isolation due to the in ear design. CONCLUSION: Do not buy these headphones for anything near the asking price. If anything, just pony up the money for Airpods because they're sure to be much better than what you get here."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-17,Great sound quality. Superior battery life.,I received these earbuds for my Birthday. I already had another brand that I had recently bought but since my wife had given them to me I decided to give them a try and give my other Name Brand pair to my daughter. I'm glad I did!!! These earbuds exceed my expectations. The hearing test when setting up was great since I have hearing loss in my left ear. I hear my audio books perfectly. The battery life averages around 6 Hrs not including the extra time I get with the charging unit. Sound quality is exceptional. Received calls are clear and according to my wife the quality of my voice on her side is great as well. I highly recommend.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-17,Great deal,Love em!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-17,Exactly what I wanted,Better than Apple overpriced earphones. I have recommended these earphones to several people and we all agree that they are awesome. Battery lasts a full work day. Perfect for tuning out your boss and others while you are trying to get work done. They are super comfortable and they don't fall out. Great product.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-17,Disappointed,"I was primarily going to use the Earbuds for phone conversations. My wonderful BOSE earplug is getting old and the battery will not hold the charge long. But when using them, the sound of my own voice is like out of sync and make it difficult to carry on a conversation. Music is OK"

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-19,"Best sounding , with a lot of options","The pairing process is very easy. The connectivity is very good throughout the house. Have yet to test them in the gym. The fit is very good , they feel comfortable. Now for the sound, they sound great, crisp highs punchy bass overall very balanced. I read some of the complaints about these and I don't agree with any of them, plus anker customer support is very good at correcting any issues. I would highly recommend these to everyone. And finally if the bass isn't deep enough for you use the memory foam tips and you'll vet what your missing with the regular tips. I almost forgot to mention the app, it adjusts the sound to the style of music your listening to and customize the touch assignments for the buds. For the price you cant beat these."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-20,Better than my AirPods!,Better than my AirPods! Plus they have various sized covers to fit in my ears better. Sound is amazing and I loaned them to my friend and they said the sound was better than AirPods!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-20,Very good sound at a reasonable price.,A gift for my sons who said they sounded very good. They were pleased with them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-20,Like them,"Initially received galaxy buds as an xmas gift only to find that they cut out when the phone is in your pocket which was a deal breaker. I was concerned about the BT pairing and only being able to use one bud after the reviews here. Sure enough opened them up and paired to find that only one ear bud connected. Spent a while on the BT connectivity until I figured out how to reset using the button at the bottom of the case. This fixed the pairing issue and made them sound completely different, they sounded like tin before the correct pairing. Having used them for a couple weeks now I think they do a great job. I'm still testing them out but I've been very happy thus far. If the call quality turns out to be terrible Ill be sure to update."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2020-01-20,Audio this good costs 2x as much. Build quality is lacking.,"My wife bought me a pair of the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds for my birthday. I had been shopping for some good sounding earbuds that would provide audio quality on par with my Beyerdynamics and Sennheisers, yet be convenient enough to use anywhere and durable enough to wear to the gym... That last point though... I ended up breaking them at work! Nevermind the gym! I tried Airpods, Sony WF-1000XM3's, Bose Soundsports, and a number of over the ear wireless headphones... The OTE cans were no contest, but the battery life, call quality, and functional convenience of these earbuds sold me. Audio quality is great... The full range of frequencies is well represented here, but unlike the Airpods or even the $230 Sony's I purchased over xmas, These babies have some decent bass. And they're LOUD! The volume is not an issue here. I think they sounded better than the WHX-1000's which is quite a feat. The Anker LA2's have a ton of great features... They pause when you pull them away from your ear. They have touch controls. They look pretty good. The case is small and easily fits in your pocket. Call quality is decent, though with earbuds lacking any sort of air passthrough port, it's a bit like talking with your ears plugged - not entirely natural - though one gets used to it pretty quickly. They do not have Active noise cancellation - which I tried with the Sony's and wasn't terribly impressed with - They DO however have passive noise cancellation as you jam them into your ear canal, and that, works quite well. Anker's software for the LA2's is fantastic and one of the biggest surprises. Two dozen or so EQ profiles for those of us who don't care to tweak an 8-band EQ, the ability to change the touch controls to either control play/pause or skip/previous track or even volume... And recently, they've updated the software to allow for CUSTOM EQ's, which is fantastic. There's a reason why these buds are consistently rated as being better than competitors costing over twice as much, and it has a lot to do with the guys who are still working behind the scenes after product launch. All that being said, the bad news is, at least in my case, they are NOT very durable. I dropped the right earbud.... ONCE! From about 4.5 feet onto a linoleum floor at work in the cafeteria, and well, it didn't survive the fall. It connects to my phone, and the touch controls still work, but no sound. So, sadly I will be chasing a replacement pair and will have to go several week most likely without my favorite new toy of the year. They Are very good... Just handle them with care."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-21,Connections Issues are real,so I bought them after reading good reviews of sound and look and feel. They look nice ! feel good! sound well there is the issue I could never pair both of the ear buds only one connected I reset many times looked for help online and I ever email sound core they sent instructions that I had all ready found online and did not solve issue. For the price you think they should pair easy and in all honestly shouldn't even have that issue.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-21,Good product for $100 price,"For the price, this product is real good. The thing that I didn’t like about this product is that it feels cheap (looks low quality plastic) and can fall quite easily from the charging case"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-21,Great sound!,"Great sound and easy pairing. Switching between paired devices (especially apple) can be tricky so knocked off one star. Also, would be great to program a tap or multi tap to mute the mics without having to touch your phone"

Pretty decent but not outstanding noise cancellation, but it doesn't matter because the sound is so good. Very rich and good bass is impressive. Only on quieter tracks can I hear announcements a little bit. There IS a bluetooth issue but it can be resolved by being smart. Make sure before you pull out the buds from their case that they have connected to your phone. When I switch to airplane mode the phone turns off bluetooth and I have to be sure to turn it on before grabbing the ear buds, otherwise the buds will not connect once pulled out and you then turn the bluetooth back on (you'll have to put them back in the case, open the lid, wait for connection, put in ear and wait for the chime). I figure an update will fix this issue if it comes. But a solid travel choice and the buds stay put well, although I've not yet had to run to a connecting gate."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-21,Good for listening to music only.,Bought these as a present for my daughter. Excellent for listening to music. However microphone is poor. Constant static and other noises when she calls me on her android phone.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-22,"Sound great, work great!","These sound great, pair quickly each time and are comfy. Good Airbud alternative. Definitely recommend!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-22,Good,Good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-22,OVER-RATED,"It looks like the reviews of this product are not real, these headphones are super poor quality and not worth the money"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-22,Soundcore liberty air 2,"I have purchased alot of Bluetooth headsets going back to the Motorola h 700 and countless others. I don't really use the controls on the headsets,I normally just do from my phone. Setup is easy if you go to YouTube and watch the reviews. The booklet it comes with is picture only no literature. It's comes with an array of ear gels and a type c cable. I purchased 2 of these one in white the other black. Where as I had no problems setting up mine and my fit was perfect out of the box. The other I purchased as a gift didn't fit the person well even with all the ear gels I was told. The sound is great and I listen to a wide range of different music. These are the best I have ever purchase. A few things I look for when I buy tws headset is the battery life, this one I got close to 7hrs at 50percent volume. The sound is the second and this preforms well above expectations and I am not justing talking bass. It has a nice balance sound to them where you can hear everything with in the music. Third is the build quality , these feel strudy and not cheaply made. I will purchase another pair as back up. I am loving these that much. Soundcore liberty air 2 are the best especially at this price point. I am very happy with my purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-22,You get what you pay for...I do not recommend buying unless for kids,"After years of buying top of the line ear buds I decided to try a ""budget friendly"" alternative. The reviews I read where mixed so I thought I'd give the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 a try. Not happy with the Liberty Air 2 and if you check other reviews I've submitted you'll see that almost all of them are positive because I try to be realistic about expectations. As I mention, these are a great gift for the child in your life that needs something that looks cool but isn't expecting much. All in one day....
- Received the earphones and the packaging was really nice. - Unpacked and was easily able to get the earphones working after downloading the Android app for my Samsung Note 9.
- There was a slight issue where the two earphones were acting as two separate units when they should have been acting as one. I called support and support was great. They had me reset the units and then repair and after that both worked together and I was able to hear audio when listening to music and on calls from both earphones. - My initial impression of the sound quality was terrible. The sound was actually bad, worse than a $10 set of wired earphones. After adjusting the equalizer the sound was average/ok. - Started using them and as soon as I got on my first call the other party immediately noticed a huge difference in the amount of ambient background noise he could hear. I've been using the Jabra Motion up until this point and was excited because I thought the noise cancellation technology in the Liberty Air 2 may be better considering it has 4 speakers to process sound cancellation with. I was very wrong. The noise cancellation technology didn't work at all. The Liberty Air 2 earphones were picking up everything in the background. Callers could hear my typing. They could hear me moving in my chair. They could hear my steps as I walked. They could hear the AC come on and off in the background. It's like there was no noise cancelling technology at all. - The sound quality was okay. The earphones fit exceptionally well with the default setup. I didn't have to switch anything out. These are a great gift for the kids who aren't looking for a superior product but something they can use casually. Not recommended for the professional or someone that is looking for the advertised technology because it simply doesn't work. Now I'm on back on the market for a high end solution to meet the need. At least 7 hours battery life and noise cancellation that works."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-22,Better than Rowkin,"I have been using Rowkin products for 4 years because they offered the smallest buds, with good sound quality, at a decent price fully well knowing that I would have to buy new buds every year or so because of poor product longevity either with the batter, charger, or bud drivers wearing out. This year I decided to try a different pair of buds and bought these buds because it appeared that the battery life and sound quality was what I was looking and within budget. So far I am impressed at the sound quality, battery life (both buds and case), and overall product quality. They are substantial buds that are built with quality and don't look as goofy as Apple AirPods or AirPod Pro's or Google Pixel Buds when they are in your ear. The wireless charging feature in the case is slick (no more stupid wires) and the buds are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The companion app to tweak the sound profile is cool but not necessary as the sound signature out of the box is neutral and flat. There are useful features like pausing media automatically when I remove a bud from my ear, or auto pairing when the case is opened that make these buds extremely easy to use. Good job Anker team!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-22,Great ‘Air Pods’ alternative,"I mainly wanted a set of Bluetooth headphones for calls and call quality. These meet that and more. Other than an initial hiccup out of the box (support had me fixed in about 20 min), I have zero complaints. Good sound quality, easy to use, good battery life, good noise cancellation, clear voice on calls, etc.
I really have no complaints other than sometimes the noise cancellation works TOO well and someone startles me when they touch my arm to get my attention."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-23,Definitely worth it !!!,They are amazing
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-23,good factory service,Retail price was later reduced to what was indicated as a sale price. Problem with original purchased pair. Factory exchanged very quickly with pair that worked.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-23,😃😃happy,"I love this earbuds, my brother have a AirPods pro and he said that my Soundcore liberty 2 sound much better then he’s expensive buds 😂 I really recommend this earbuds they sound great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-24,Best in market for the money value.,Best out in market for money.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-24,"Great option, great value at a good price.","I haven't had a ton of time with these yet, but so far:
- pairing could have been easier, but once you understand that one bud pairs through the other, it's no problem and repairs easily. - the look, case, and quality is all very good. There may be better out there, but for the money, I'm very happy. - they sound great. Again, maybe there is better out there, but I doubt it at this price. - No active noise cancelling, but the seal on the earbuds blocks out a good amount anyway. Bottom line, for the price, this is a great pair of true wireless earbuds, with enough higher end features (Qi charging, clear calls, customizable EQ) that I don't feel like I'm missing out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-01-24,"A Solid set of earbuds, if you can get them to stay put","I lost a set of airpods at the beginning of the 2019 holiday season, and I needed a replacement since I wasn't about to go back to a set of wired headphones. I wanted wireless charging. tap controls, and something that would block out ambient noise well enough that I could actually make use of these in my crowded gym or on public transit without straining to hear them, but I wasn't keen on paying almost $200 for something I knew only met two of those criteria. After getting a gift card to a big box retailer, that covered the cost of the liberty airs minus sales tax, I decided to try something new, especially since I could return them if they just didn't work. With that said, I really like these earbuds. They have great sound quality for a wide variety of music genres, and the app they come with not only lets you optimize them for your preferred gene, but they also let you customize what tap control input performs which function. The case is only slightly bigger than the airpod case, but it does offer longer battery life, so it's not like it's for no good reason. Honestly, I can use these things intermittently each day and not need to charge them more than once a week. The only real issue I've had with them that gave me pause was the tips. They come with 5 different sizes of silicone tips, but I still had issues finding a set that fits particularly well. I tried getting a set of memory foam tips from comply, and while they were able to fit onto the earbuds themselves, they still didn't stay put 100% of the time.Even after finding the right size tips and figuring out how to properly insert them into my ears (I found a lateral twisting/scooping sort of motion worked best to get them in place) they still come loose periodically, and I find myself having to adjust them every couple of minutes until they finally settle into place. They especially refuse to stay put when I'm trying to eat with them in. I wound up keeping them largely due to financial issues, but I decided I'd rather have to adjust their fit occasionally rather than have a set of earbuds that frequently ran out of power, were drowned out by ambient noise in places where you'd actually WANT to have your earbuds in (on a plane, on the subway, or at the gym). If you're the kind of person who places a higher premium on something that does its job well instead of something that's common place or fashionable to own, these are a great choice at a very budget friendly price and I would recommend you at least try them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-24,Don't buy,Connection problems with the sound every once in a while when reconnecting.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-25,Just OK,The sound quality is OK. The noise cancellation is below average. The battery life is good.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-25,It not the best for noise cancellation but everything else is good,So far so good I been using it for 2 month now and I like it
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-25,Asked the Key Question - Will they work independently (both right and left)?,"The answer I got was ""yes"". The reality though, is no. If this matters to you and you order them anyway, get ready to be frustrated."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-26,Good quality for the price.,"Well worth the money, but sound and noise cancellation were a bit underwhelming."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-26,Been a Week...,"It's only been a week but wow, these are awesome. Call quality is remarkable, the music quality is great (unless you're a Beats fan and love heavy bass), easy to use, and the battery just keeps going. I only wish they had the transparent mode, but either earbud can be used at a time so that helps. Two small issues. First was the initial pairing wouldn't work correctly but resetting them using a 60 second YouTube video worked. Second, the inserts that came with them were not comfortable for me so I had to use other ones from a different brand. Overall, I'm glad I didn't spend more money on a different product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-26,Won't pair,"Everytime I use these I have to ""Forget This Device"" and completely reset them and go through the pairing process over and over again. Terrible."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-26,Awesome,All around great . Best set I've had in a while
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-27,Could be really great .. If .....,Worked great in the beginning! Loved it and was thinking of ordering a second one. Unfortunately recently it needed a firmware update and the app would not function without it. I spend endless hours trying to download and install it but it would stop at about 70%. I searched online for hours and tried every conceivable fix. After endless efforts to remedy the situation I gave up and devided I will use it without the features available on the app or send it back.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-27,I really good choice,"Noise cancelling its passive so how well it works depends on how tight the fit is in your ear. Battery life is amazingly long and the charging pack hold a charge for a long time. I think I've only had to plug it in once in a month. My one concern and the reason I didn't give these earbuds 5 stars is that when I've used both together four a call, one will crackle a little."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-27,Pairing issue. Solved for me. Poor mic in phone call,First time i paired it. The left one was working but after resetting it (hold for 10 seconds) then i paired it. Everything is working fine. Sound quality is very good. (The mic is not working well if you are out door or you are in place with noise. It will not give you a clear sound in phone call.) I hope they can fix the in software update.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-27,Better than the original.,"This fixes all the problems the original Liberty Air earbuds had. They're comfortable to wear for long periods. Sound isolates well, it's not noise cancelling. Bluetooth 5 helps with stable connections even at a fair distance. USB C and wireless charging is very convenient."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-27,Don’t do it,"Not a Apple replacement for sure. Fit not as comfortable, functionality is not very good. Wasted my money"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-27,Great set of wireless earbuds for phone calls,"I need a set of earbuds for making calls. I have not had any issues with phone calls, and people have not had any issues hearing me. The call quality can get a little compromised in a noisy room/coffee shop/etc... But that shouldn't be a surprise. For less than $100, these can't be beat for phone calls and even for music. Super happy with this purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-27,Great Product!,Great headphones. Great sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-28,Excellent product and customer service oustanding,"after they send me a second pair the second pair work perfect no problem at all excellent earbuds, for the customer services they are the best out there believe me they take care of the customer very seriously and I appreciate that thank you very much I recommended 100% to any body out there, Luis Diaz amazon customer for 10 yrs"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-28,Great gift!,"I bought a set of black and white ones for my sone and daughter-in-law for Christmas. One pair wored perfectly out of the box, but the other pair needed to be reset. Easy enough. They have been very pleased. Sound is good, battery life is amazing. The ability to use only the right or the left was is great. I wish I had a pair, but I have the original Air earbuds. Love them too."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-28,Excellent all around,"I'd done quite a bit of research before trying these. I have been looking for a dependable set, but very importantly, excellent call quality, and these have been great. Sound quality is surprisingly good - better than I expected. I am a music industry professional, and can definitely hear a great, fairly neutral profile. Battery life is excellent - I haven't charged the case in 2 weeks despite wearing these for an hour or so at the gym every day. Android users - these have AptX, which isn't that common but is the way Android gets high quality signal. I leave my phone in the middle of my gym and am able to get a great signal and sound from 30 feet away, easily. Great buy; I'm very happy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-28,They sound is good,Good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-28,Great performance for the price,So far this product has lived up to expectations. The battery life and sound quality is excellent.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,Just that they are the best wireless I’ve had,I use it to listen to my music at work.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-29,More bass would be five stars! Quality product,The only minor issue I have personally is that I wish it had a little more bass and volume in the sound. They fit well and aren’t too bulky in your ear compared to some others. The battery life is exceptional and I received excellent customer service when I called because of a minor initial connection problem when syncing my phone for the first time. I’ve recommended this product to several people. For the price they are a great value! They need to come out with a silicone protective case :)
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-29,Quite the value!,"I received these as a (requested) gift for Xmas, as a cheaper alternative to the Apple pro model. At $100 vs apple’s $250, I think these were a steal. The sound quality is excellent and the feedback from those I’m speaking with (the main reason I wanted these) is excellent, no complaints. That said, it was a tad wonky with the initial connection, only initially connecting on k e ear, and then the other. And it seems to take a couple extra seconds to connect to Bluetooth vs the Apple. The figment in my ear holds fairly well (far better than the regular Apple AirPods,
Which always feel like they are going to fall out of my ears), but may have a little slip with vigorous exercise. We’ll see. All in all I’m quite pleased. A great value."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-29,"Sound great, but comfort could be better","Sound amazing, and like the low profile case. The only downer is they hurt my ears after around 30-40 minutes, and I need to take a break form them. Maybe a greater variety of ear tips could help?"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,everything I need,"I use these as work headphones and the ability to listen with just one piece, and the small package allows me to perform without issue. I recommend these earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,Best for the bucks,"Slightly difficult to connect both earphones, but once connected they sound great and are very comfortable to wear. Will buy them for my whole family."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,Great fit / Great battery life / great sound / great for phone calls. The whole package!,"A few notes after using this extensively for a few days:
The setup process is a LITTLE non-intuitive (I had to pull up more information on their website to complete setup that the printed manual simply didn't cover -- specifically about setting up independent earbud operation), but once you get both earbuds set up, it makes it trivial to pull out both earbuds and listen in stereo, or to pull out the right earbud and listen on one side, or to pull out the left earbud to listen on just the left side. After reading reviews of almost every other wireless earbud out there, I don't think any other brand or model has mastered how to create a seamless experience with using one or both earbuds. I am also SUPER IMPRESSED that Anker included 5 difference sizes of eartips. That is honestly unheard of by myself. There are more expensive wireless earbuds out there that I'm sure provided even more for what you pay for, but I don't think you're going to find such quality and features from any other set of earbuds out there at this price point. I've bought a variety of Anker and Eufy products over the last few years, and to see a company constantly reinvest in improving build quality and service the way that they have is incredible."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,Happy,Very happy w them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-29,"sound good for the price and for it's form factor, EQ is great to have, issue out of the box","What I like
they sound good for the price and for it's form factor
here's what I compare with, not exactly high end but good enough so far for what I need. Audio technica M50x + douk audio P1 AMP
Audio technica IM70 or 1more quad + ear studio es100
1more stylish wireless
EQ is great to have, real ID is interesting but opposite to to my liking,
ended up with max treble and flat on rest of the frequencies
vs my preference would max 100hz bass and lower treble depend on the headset
Don't like
issue out of the box, right side not working, took a while to google/youtube the fix
not sure if it's batch issue or need better QC/test plan from factory. wish to have
if you already have EQ app then tune headset to a flat/natural sound as default and let the user customize. reference the Audio technica IM70. still, if I don't have any wireless headphones and don't want to spend more than $100, this would be it. I'll be returning even having to pay a fee to. will look into the liberty 2 pro. Hopefully it's want I'm looking for."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-29,Bluetooth issues with left earbud,Left earbud won’t pair. Google search that and see how many people have this problem. Returning for refund.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,Best earbuds for the money,Best earbud I have purchased. Great value and performance. Just got them so we will see how they hold up. Wish they would switch to my other phone like my Apple AirPods. Other than that they are great.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,ohhhhhhhhhhhhh,Freaking love this earbuds!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-29,"Good for calls, terrible for music",Good for calls inside and out. Sound quality for music was terrible. Sounded like my Walkman headphones from 1992.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-29,love the sound,"It took more effort than expected to get it to synch with my iphone, but since then has worked great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-01-30,Undecided,"Overall these earphones work. The earphones do not update and the hear ID function doesn't work. Spoke with the rep at soundcore but having did what was told, they still do not work. Have connection with both earpiece and can be used; other than that as mentioned no updates and no hear ID, so those functions are useless."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-30,Great Deal,Love the price and the product.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-30,Better second time around.,Could never get both earphones to sync at the same time to an iPhone 11. Returned and bought AirPods which work perfectly. Update: I was sent a second set of earphones to try and they synced up the first try. They sound great and fit better than the standard AirPods. They still occasionally loose sync but then reconnect quickly. Would now recommend as an alternative to AirPods.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-01-30,Love them,I got mine from Best Buy and i love them. Best wireless headphones that were inexpensive.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-30,bad beginnings - happy endings,"I wanted to like these. The form factor and fit was perfect. The price point, even at list price, was right. Unfortunately, I was unable to update the firmware. Kept saying an error occurred. Please try again. After an hour of repeated attempts, I gave up. AnkerDirect's customer service did not give up on me. I was sent a second pair, the firmware updated properly and they have performed flawlessly. The personalized EQ works well, a really nice feature."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-31,Best truly wireless earbuds for a reasonable price,I use these ear buds daily. After figuring out what ear bud tip size fits me the best they turned into my favorite pair. Anker has never steared me wrong when it comes to their products.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-31,Good buy no regrets,First initial impressions after first day of use. Product feels good in hand. Feels very durable. Easy to pair up with phone and app. It doesn’t have active noise cancellation but passive noise cancellation is good if you select the right ear tips and comfortable. Sound preference is very customizable. Took a phone call on a single earbud and call didn’t seem to be good caller said they had heard a lot of background noise. Took another call using both earbuds and call quality was definitely better. Definitely recommend these for purchase
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-31,It's amazing 10 STAR,"I love this Earbuds it's amazing ...
It's connected to my laptop

Awesome Design
Good Sound
Awesome Built Quality"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-01,Another great Anker product,"I purchased these mostly because I have purchased a few other things from Anker (bluetooth speaker, wireless charger, power bank). I have had no problems with any of those products and have been happy with them all and these earbuds are no exception. Pros:
They are very comfortable. I hardly know they are in my ears. They stay put. They come with a couple of different size rubber ear covers. Found one that worked and they don't budge much when I run, walk the dogs or go to the gym. The battery life. I just used them for a little over a week. Gym just about every day, a couple of long dog walks and never got a battery low warning. I'm charging them now because I'd hate to have to do without them
The sound quality. I'm not an audio expert, but I like how these sound. The app provided gives you some pre-configured settings (I use ""Lounge"") which works well for me. I have found that the bass and overall quality of sound is better with the stems (right term) closer to your ear rather than sticking out. The noise reduction. I wouldn't say noise canceling and I don't think there is a claim to do this, but it does block out a LOT of noise around you. At the gym, I don't hear the gym's music or conversations of other members. Cons:
I really can't think of any, and I'm really trying. These earbuds look good, feel good and work very well. I'm not surprised given my past purchases from Anker have been great. If I purchase another electric device, I'll check to see whether Anker makes it before I purchase from another company."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-01,One quit working after one month. REVIEW NOW UPGRADED!,"I have updated these earbuds to 5 stars after some great customer service. I even missed their first email and they kept trying to contact me to see about sending a new pair since one quit working after a month of use. New ones have been received and are working great! Daughter is once again happy with her Christmas present, and I am now happy with Anker's prompt outreach to me and how quickly they sent out a new pair. I have a few other Anker items that I've been very pleased with and now that streak continues. Thanks Anker! Old review below:
One of the earbuds quit working a few days ago, I see now I'm one day past the return window. Considering these were a Christmas present for my daughter, they barely lasted a month. Very disappointing, should last much longer for $100!!! Daughter was so happy with them ... when they both worked!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-02,Very good for the price!,"PROs
+ Case and buds looks good and no cheap
+ Charges with any UsbA-C and C-C... And wireless! + Sound is fine but bot perfect. There are different EQ presets or you can custom to your liking. + Earbuds are independent. + Battery life was great at least this first week. + App is good built, has many options, and different ways to get support. CONs
- Wish it had a volume slider
- Call quality is not great. People didnt hear me fine."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-02,Best of best,Big fan of Anker. I have i lot Anker products and they never left me down. Sound is great. Nice fit. Sound cancellation is excellent. If i can give 10 stars i give them 10 . Good job Anker

The vendor reached out and want ed to make this right. So they sent my daughter a new pair! She is so delighted as these were the ones after much research wanted. She really likes the sound quality and the fit. So she is super hyped about getting these replaced. Kudos to the company for wanting to do right by their customer! Original Review: Gave it 2 stars:
Bought these for y daughter for Christmas and after 4 weeks, the charging case will not work. And with no other charging options, pretty much a waste of $100."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-03,"Why get airpods, these are half the price and sound amazing",Great bang for the buck. Great sound quality and deep bass.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-03,Perfect,Good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-03,Great sound .,I had a set of monster ear buds which i gave to my son. I tried to repurchase a set but they weren't in stock so I got these instead. These are better then then the monster buds. Glad I took a chance on them. Just make sure you download the app and update the firmware.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-02-03,It works great!,Volume reduced whenever I switched over from car bluetooth to this wirelesa head set.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-04,Great quality,Awesome earbuds.. stay in place & very comfortable
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-04,Well worth the money.,Best sound quality buds I have ever had. Battery life with the case is better than I expected. I have walked into a different part of the house and never had them disconnect.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-04,The BEST earbuds I've ever bough!,After buying 4 pairs of earbuds i have finally found the ones i love! The sound quality of the earbuds is amazing. My favorite feature is the hear ID. Its your own unique personalized hearing profile to ensure you get the best sound. The battery life on the liberty air 2 is amazing i can go an entireday without charging them. The fit is extremely comfortable sometimes i even forget that i have them on. I use them at work for about 3 hours straight and i don't get ear fatigue. Also they dont pop out of my ears. If you want earbuds with a great sound and battery life these are it!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-04,100% Recommend!! Would buy again.,"I have zero complaints! These are exactly what I wanted. I was debating between these and Airpods Pro. After reading many reviews and watching youtube videos, I went with these. Also decided if I lose these it hurts my wallet less to replace them. The touch controls work perfectly. They paired right away. Sound quality is good. I am usually a Skull Candy ear bud user. These are comparable sound-wise, if not a little nicer than those. Very comfy too! Super happy with my decision!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-05,A decent wireless earbud and a great customer service from Anker,"I would love to say this earbuds exceeds my expectations and Anker customer service is just top notch...
I previously purchased a piece of this earbuds and I encountered a little bit of issue which was the firmware update issue...
But as soon as I complained, Anker's customer service responded almost immediately and I got my earbuds replaced in a week which was appealing...
I've been using my new earbuds for a couple of weeks now and I've had no issue with them... I just love the sound quality and especially the HearID is just great... It's a decent piece of earbuds I will recommend to anyone. And with Anker, you can never go wrong"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-05,Frustration free experience without compromise.,"FULL DISCLOSURE: This a subjectively constructed objective review. After much frustration with Bose SoundSport Free earbuds, I decided to cut my losses and look for something that would meet the following criteria:
1) Frustration free Bluetooth pairing
2) Excellent sound quality
3) Excellent battery Life
4) No Connectivity Issues/ Connection Drops
I can happily say that the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 wireless earbuds have met all of the requirements that most other products fail to meet. My experience with the Bose SoundSport Free earbuds was often met with issues and compromises that made me wonder how a flagship product from such a reputable company ever made it to the market. Successfully pairing the Bose earbuds was a constant battle. When successful pairing was finally achieved, one earbud would often disconnect. This forced the user to go through a complicated ""reset"" procedure in order to ""fix"" the issue. Poor battery life for both the storage ""charging"" pod and the buds was also something that plagued the earbuds. Total discharge would often occur over the course of two days, limiting the use over long term use. Sound would often lag when watching videos on YouTube, and worst of all ""by design"" only one earbud would work when paired to the PC. Thankfully, the Soundcore Liberty Air 2's do not have any of these issues. Pairing with my Samsung Galaxy S10+ was effortless, without any syncing issues or video playback problems. Both earbuds stayed in sync at all times, and did not require any ""resetting"" or waiting for the starts to align in order to work successfully. Pairing with the PC on Windows 10 was as simple, just like the initial pairing with the phone. Sound quality by no means makes these the holy grail of earbuds for any self proclaimed audiophile, but they are excellent in terms of providing fine tuned sound and noise isolation. I would consider the sound quality to be superb, especially at this price range. I can without hesitation say that sound is marginally better than the pricier Bose earbuds ($225). Comfort is subjective, but the smaller size and choice of 5 silicon inserts leaves these as the clear winner over the Bose earbuds. The optional app that Anker provides is pretty simple, offering an equalizer for further tuning to carter to whatever sound style one may prefer. The ""Hear ID' offers additional assistance by running you through a simple ""hearing test"" in order to develop a personalized sound map for both left and right earbud. The app also allows the user to remap touch gestures so that custom functions can be assigned to meet your exact preference. I found the app to be quite intuitive without much bloatware, an approach that's rather simplistic with focus on just what's needed. Overall i am very satisfied with the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2's. Providing an objective review on earbuds is a very difficult, if not an impossible task. Personal bias and preferences are bound to influence any review, no matter what anyone says. Forming a baseline of reasonable expectations is the best way that one can establish realistic representation of the product being reviewed. Issues often plaguing devices in this segment were not observed with Liberty Air 2's, which is something that a user would expect in this price range. Sound quality, comfort, and overall user experience would exceed most reasonable expectations in this price category. I would not hesitate to recommend this product, especially if it's one that you are considering over a pricier unit. TLDR: In the wise words of Jim Cramer: BUY BUY BUY!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,0,2020-02-05,Great at first,They are awsome when they worked. First off I’m a big fan of all their products that’s why I purchased the liberty air 2. They worked pretty well for the first 2 months but later on the buds tended to unpair From each other for no reason. Now I did reset them and paired them how the manual tells you and it does work at first but down the line they stoped pairing to one another.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-06,Really great,"Great pair of earbuds. Love the long lasting battery, long distance connection and great sounding, using the app. Also very comfortable fit. There is nothing negative that I can say about these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-06,Mixed Bag,"Unlike some reviewers, I had no problem pairing with my Iphone. I just brought the case close, pressed the pairing button and it was done. They have not failed to connect at all. Distance is long, sound is great, wireless charging works well. They are excellent for phone calls if you can get used to the blocked ear feeling. I am hoping that a software update will allow passthrough sound. Siri works great. I have tried many earbuds, including Apple airbuds, second generation and latest one. They were a disaster for me... never fit my ears correctly, phone would default to built in speaker all the time and would often refuse to switch to the airpod I was trying to use for the call. Siri worked OK, but that is about it. Battery life seemed much shorter than it should have. They went back. I am not affiliated with the company in any way, and I paid full price for the item. This is a real and honest review that I was not paid or asked to write."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-06,Good quality,Better than expected

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-06,Earbuds,Very comfortable and looks/feels great. Great price and quality.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-07,Customer service replaced defective product,"Update:
After contacting customer support, I got a new pair of earphones. -----------------------------------
Original review:
Never had a problem with the previous version of these earphones but now the right earphone is not being disconnected when put in the box and it doesn't charge anymore. Since I bought them I had trouble getting them to connect with my phone but now this is unbearable"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-07,Sound too Tinny/Distorted,"I like the model, the customizable touch gestures were nice and the wireless charging case was great as I can charge them with my phone's PowerShare feature, but the sound quality killed it for me. I've used several kinds of earbuds before and the more affordable ones all have the same problem. They sound kind of tinny or hollow, like I'm listening to them through a tin can. If you've never listened to higher quality earbuds, it might not be an issue for you, but if you're an audiophile it will bother you like hell. I did everything I could with the EQ but I couldn't fix it. I get wragged on for this but I've used Beatsx for years. I know Beats is considered a joke of a Sound Hardware company, ""bad audio quality for high price,"" so to speak. But as far as I know, that's generally with headphones, not earbuds. With memory foam tips and the right EQ, my Beatsx have no noticeable tin/distortion, and the buds are very small, meaning I can comfortably sleep with them. They sound great and feel great. Only issue is they're not true wireless and have loads of hardware issues. Hence, here I am trying out new earbuds. I want true wireless earbuds and don't care if they're super small anymore, just as long as they're comfortable and sound at least as good as my Beatsx. Coming from Beatsx to these, the tin/distortion was just too jarring. I don't think it was a defect as I notice this effect on any reasonably priced earbuds, wired and wireless, even with other Beats earbuds. I believe I'm just picky about sound quality, and these just didn't have what I'm looking for in that regard. Its disappointing because I liked literally everything else about them. Look, if you're just an average Joe coming from the standard wired earbuds that came with your phone, these are a great option. But if you're an audiophile in any sort of way, mild as it may be, or are used to a higher quality audio experience, then I cant recommend these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-07,"Nice, but not exactly what I wanted. Anker responded very well","This is an update from my original review. Anker Customer Service quickly reached out to me and worked on a resolution for my tiny ears. They provided a comparable set of buds that had wings which keeps the buds from falling out. The sound is awesome, the battery life is great (6 hrs at moderate volume) & I love the slide open charging case. Anker is a company that knows how to work with its customers. I am very satisfied with the replacement buds (though not liberty 2s, these are just as good in sound quality). I'll be an Soundcore guy moving forward. The sound quality is very nice...when it stays in my ear (I have small ear canals & none of the caps can stop the drops). I like the wireless charging, it should become standard for all cases. This has nice battery life as I use it all day at work, but when the bud needs to be recharged you can't switch from one to the other (only the left can play mono). It takes about 15 minutes to quick charge and I get about another hour to get me thru the day. Overall very good sound when I call, no ""be aware"" mode (not a big deal for me). Unfortunately, I must return due to the constant falling out from my ears (ear ""wings"" would've been nice)."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-08,Better than I hoped for,Initially had some trouble getting it to remain connected. Not sure what the issue was but disconnected and repaired with my phone no problem since. Play with the sound to get it right. Anker is a great company ! They will help you if needed!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-11,"Great earbuds, and not just for the price!","My experience with earbuds and headphones is rather extensive. I've used very nice ones, and fairly budget ones. The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 fall right in the middle, and that's exactly what I excepted. Opening them up is, Apple adjacent. The package is quite nice and everything opens quite easily. Not quite to the level of Apple, but near it. Pairing them was as simple as opening the case. My iPhone XS, and the Soundcore app found them within a few seconds. Once they were paired the first time, just open up the case and within a few seconds you are automatically connected and listening to your music or making phone calls. Sound quality was surprising for a pair of $100 earbuds. I went into it without expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I compared them directly to a pair of Powerbeats Pro's and while the Powerbeats Pro's were better, I wouldn't say they were necessarily worth the extra $150. I have used these side by side with the following: Jaybird X2, Powerbeats, urBeats 3, Powerbeats 3, Powerbeats Pro, Beats Studio 3, Bose QuiteComfort 35 II, and Klipsch Image S4i. Being an expansive list of earbuds and headphones I would say comparing them to the $350 Bose QuiteComfort's is probably not a fair comparison. However, These fall right in line where I expected them to after using them for a while. I suppose I could list a few ""cons"" here but honestly for the price, those go out the window. Sure, the bass could be a bit more present on some songs, the noise cancellation could be a bit better on an airplane, but for $100 those cons don't really hold up and you are left with a pretty darn good listening experience. Overall, these are a solid choice at this price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2020-02-11,"Adjustments Needed, but Liberty Air 2s worth the price and purchase","I bought the Liberty Air 2s, after listening to several reviews, for the gym. After charging them the next day I wore them to the gym. The sound quality was different in a larger space than at home. Had to make several adjustments and repositioned them in my ears several times, on different machines. Especially since I sweat quite a bit while there. On the Elliptical machine I had to take them out and put them in the case and put them back in, because they kept going in and out, and off and on. The battery life was as advertised. I keep them charged and the other day I took them out a good part of the day. Just have to keep playing with positioning them in my ears not too far, adjusting the volume and other controls. Would like to see the customized portion on the app tweaked to get things just right sound wise."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-11,No secure fitting,Tried all the ear attachment and the earbuds keep coming out of my ear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-12,Sound quality is great,Much better then the Airpods.. Their App works so well when setting to you own hearing...
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-12,Constant disconnect/ unpair issues,"They function well 70% of the time. I often have to reset them to get them both to function, and often I have only one playing audio. It's really frustrating. When they work they work well, I don't see these lasting more than a few months though."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-13,"Almost perfect, but not quite","I want to start by saying I have had a mixed experience with the Liberty Air 2’s. I own the Soundcore Life P2 wireless earbuds and compared to them, the Air 2’s come a tad short. Let me start off with the good:
Battery life: Amazing! As stated in the description, the battery life will not disappoint, as in my experience, they can easily last most of an 8-hour work day before needing to be charged. With volume between 30-50%, I can use these from about 7am-2pm before the battery hitting 20%. (I never let them fully die)
Sound: Pretty good. Music, movies, and phone calls all sound full, with a good balance among highs, lows, and mids. The bass is above average, however these are no beats, so set your expectations as such. Connectivity: Good. I am able to walk a decent amount of distance between the phone and earbuds before the signal begins to drop, maybe 30-40 ft, with obstacles in between. You simply open the case and immediately they connect to your phone; I am very impressed. Now for my mixed/bad experiences:
Phone calls: Extremely mixed experience. My issue with clarity, and sound quality has never been an of concern with the Liberty Air 2’s, but the problem comes from consistency. While on call, more often then not, the other party would eventually be unable to hear me, regardless of battery life or repeated resetting of the earbuds. It became so frequent that I have to order a replacement. Additionally, I found out there is a app that is made for these, and I recommend downloading it, as there was a software update available, and so far this has appeared to remedy this issue. Touch Controls: Not my favorite. Like the Life P2 earbuds, the Liberty Air 2’s have touch controls on the side of each earbuds, which through the app, can be remapped to perform different tasks. Some options include: pause, play, skip track, raise volume, lower volume, etc.
Additionally, these earbuds are independent of their case because you can actually turn them off when not in use, which saves battery and means you don’t have to lug around the case when not using! The problem with the touch controls is that they are too sensitive when responding to touch. Simply carrying them in your hand or lightly grabbing them for too long of a period will turn them off, and this happens more often than not. This could be prevented if the controls were actually buttons as you would have to physically press them and not touch. Overall, if you are willing to get the app, these can be a good pair of earbuds, especially for phone calls. Also, there is not noise cancellation."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-13,Beats Apple,A fantastic buy! I put them to the test with the Apple equivalent and found them to be superior at less tha half the price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2020-02-13,These earbuds suck,"I bought the $200 Sony WH-1000XM3 (widely considered the best sounding true bluetooth earbuds available at time of this review) along with the Encafire G20 ($40 high rated generic brand), and the Liberty Air 2 earbuds and did both call and music tests between them after updating to latest firmware (as of Feb 2020). Summary - these Anker Liberty Air 2 earbuds are inferior to both of those. The Sony's are well worth the praise - absolutely amazing warm deep sound, and with outstanding active noise cancellation. But the call quality is barely acceptable in loud environments due to all the background noise they let through. I thought the Liberty Air 2's would have better call quality, and as long as they had decent audio I was going to go with them. But wow is the sound horrific. Compared to the Sony earbuds these Ankers are completely flat and lifeless. Even Stevie Wonder would bemoan the sound quality on these things. The reviewers praising the sound quality have clearly never listened to a pair of headphones over $5, because even the most basic set of wired bargain bin ones would outperform these Liberty Air 2s. The Soundcore Android app does allow for custom EQ settings to improve the sound quality, but no EQ voodoo can compensate for how poor these are for audio. I had read this in various reviews around the web and thought they were just being too picky, but no...if you care about audio quality you should not buy these. The call quality was an even bigger disappointment. I tested these with co-workers in a loud coffee shop and was told they could barely hear me but clearly hear the surrounding noise around me. We could not have a conversation due to the background noise the mics let through. Both Sony and Anker did firmware updates in Jan 2020 specifically to improve call quality, and now appear to be comparable. I'd actually pick the Sony's over these for calls because the voice quality is superior on the Sony's. I did not test these in windy conditions, so maybe the noise cancellation is optimized for that but not for general background noise. When I switched mid call to my trusty old Plantronics Voyager 5200 I was told it was like I moved to a different location - no background noise at all. Bottom line - do not buy these for phone conferences unless you are in a quiet location. I did like the nice small case, USB-C charging, the earbud stems which allow for twisting the buds into your ears to block more sound, and how seamless they connect and disconnect from the phone when taken out of the case or removed from your ears. But the Encafire G20s have similar size case, same level of passive noise cancellation, and same seamless integration with Android while having vastly superior sound at less than half the price. I actually went with the G20s over both the Sony and Anker earbuds because the sound was good enough, the call quality was equally poor, and the price was well below the other two. Best to buy something cheap now and hold out for improvements to bluetooth earbud technology coming in the next couple years."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-13,Great sound but some issues,"I want to love these, and the sound is fabulous. But they don't always connect, and I often have to reset them or restart my phone. It's very frustrating that they're not consistent."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-13,THE BEST !!!,Amazing!!! The best wireless earbuds for the cost on all of amazon
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-14,Nice build quality but do not fit my ears,These earphones get rave reviews but this is completely dependent on ear fitment. I have discovered that my ears do not fit silicone eartips without the additional support of wing tips. So the sound for me is terrible without any bass and the earphones fall out with any head movement. Fitment issues aren’t really the fault of Anker though. Their build quality is very good. As nice as any Apple product. The app is also well designed.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-14,$100 Limit? Like Bass? Take a lot of phone calls? Are you willing to tweak the app? - Buy these,"Once I stopped working remotely and was back in a office the need for a pair of wireless earbuds came into affect for taking calls. That being said, I also listen to a lot of music so I wanted earbuds that sounded good. After doing some research on the interwebs with the thought that I wanted quality and not pay $200+ the Liberty Air 2 seemed like a good option. Since getting them I've been extremely happy with the purchase BUT I will also say it took a little effort to get the full performance out of them. To begin i had to reset these earbuds to get them connected to my phone which was frustrating, but at the same time it was easy to find instruction to troubleshoot. I think a lot of the reason why others have had similar issues is because these earbuds have a separate Bluetooth connection for each pod, which older devices are not able to handle, but this feature actually differentiates the quality from a listening and talk perspective as the buds don't have to communicate with one another and avoids any lag or dependency when it comes to audio quality (airpods connect to one another). Once connected the next huge piece is downloading the Soundcore app on your phone. I say this because whichever setting you choose will play a huge role in how your music sounds. To my amazement piano setting is the favorite but it accentuates the bass and treble to what i'm looking for. Before these i used the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear for a year and loved them, but can honestly say after doing the ""work"" these sound better because they're more powerful. Tips: you HAVE to download the app
Pros:
Battery life - Compared to a lot of other first generation wireless ear pods specs their longevity is insane. I have yet to have them come close to dying on me. BASS - It's there and from reading/watching a lot of other reviews these are really hard to beat
Sound quality - If you take the time to figure out what sound best to you it will be an impressive experience
Phone calls - Calls are clear and the ear pod stem is closer to your mouth which I personally makes a difference
Noise canceling - Not an actual feature but if you're listening to half volume you're not going to hear anything around you
Fit - Very good. They come with a variety of ear-tips and i have never had them fallout while walking around town
Price - At $100 are these the best wireless earbuds on the market? No, but if you're spending more I would hope it's for a very specific reason for splurging
Cons:
Set-Up can be an issue. I would not consider these plug and play when it comes to reaching their full potential. Sony 1000MX3 - These are my music headphones I've had for years and are in a different league, but today in 2020 I couldn't see myself justifying the $300 price tag
Airpods Pro - Go on youtube to watch the comparison videos of these products and decide if the price difference is worth it"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-14,Great for phone calls. Disappointing connectivity issues,"These buds sound great when working. I use them primarily for phone calls and I am told my voice sounds clear even when I'm in windy or other noisy environment, so I very happy with that. The only problem is that the connection is not reliable, making it extremely frustrating to use. The left bud will sometimes ""blink"" on and off during a call or when playing music, which is really annoying. often one of the buds will completely lose connection and I have to put both back in the case, close it, wait 2 seconds and take them out again to fix it. If it weren't for these connection issues, these could have been a really great set"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-14,Love These Earbuds,So worth the money. The fit and sound are excellent. Far better than the Sony WF1000XM3.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-14,Look out airpods!!,"Has 4 sets of ear seals, I went up one size and got great seal. Great bass, mids, and treble. Call quality also great. Definitely an airpods killer!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-15,"Great performance, great quality, great value.","These earbuds sound great, they stay in my ears and they reliably pair to my phone. The battery life is fantastic! The noise cancellation good when listening to music, but less effective for podcasts. The Soundcore app is easy to use and customize the sound to your liking."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-15,Great deal!,I love these headphones. Definitely more for the money!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-15,Great sound but hard to pair,"they sound great, better than the previous generation. However, in my experience they are a bit flaky pairing with my Google Pixel 2. I get drop outs sometimes, or it is simply very slow to pair and I have to fumble with the controls. With the previous generation of this soundcore headset, the pairing was so fast that when I took it out of the case and lifted it to my ear, pairing would be complete by the time I had it inserted. So at that level I consider these a step backwards. What good are Bluetooth headsets that you can't pair with, no matter how good they sound?"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-15,Better in every way to the Gen 1 version,"Awesome headphones. I had the first gen versions, but wanted to upgrade for the USB-C and the wireless charging. The feel a lot more premium than the originals, not disappointed at all."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-15,Best for the price,This is the best true wireless buds I have found for the price!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-15,Great sound not good fit,Personally they didn't fit my ears I have small ears I think some someone with small ears should get the airpods the airpods fit perfectly

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,Everyone should have them,They are as good as my Beats.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,This is amazing earbuts in my life,"I do recommend to buy this item if you are looking for earbuts around $100. This item has Noise cancellation is when you call to someone only but still nice. It also has high battery life each times (7hours). However, I don’t recommend to buy it if you are crazy with “sound qualiter” because many earbuts which has noise canceling is middle quality of sound and this item is also one of them but you may cover to use app can change sound type(acoustic sound, pop music sound etc...). Finally, if temporarily you want talking your girl/boy friend, YES you should buy this but you want to listening your girl/boy friend voice, NO you must meet your lover."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-16,unappealing,not great at all
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-16,Constantly falling out.,Great product aside from the fact that I cannot get them to stay in my ears especially while working out which is primarily what I purchased them for. They dont even stay in well while not working out. Tried all the replacement tips provided and still an issue. Have never had such a problem with other similar style ear buds. Truly a shame.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-02-16,Perfect for most people.,"Sound is phenomenal. I love the app. I would like to see more options for ear tips, possibly like the double cone ones that come with certain Beats in-ear headphones. And I would like to see more commands be added to the touch controls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-16,Not designed to sit snugly I. Your ear,These buds do last a long time but they were not good for my ears at all. The interchangeable buds come in varied sized but are not long enough to stay in my ear when active. I constantly feel like they will fall out. I had some other made buds that I interchanged but they made them too big to close them in the case. If you want to keep them in there snug I suggest a different brand.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,Great 👍,"this is my first earbuds, at first I thought the sound was not loud enough, then after contacting support they advised me to play with equalizer and I did, and they sound perfect."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,Great,Great product! As advertised
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,"Amazing Product, well worth the price.","I’ve owned this product for a few days now, an let me say I am super glad I decided to go with these... I really wanted something similar to Air Pods but didn’t really wanna fork over the $250 price tag... After watching several review videos and reading several reviews about these I can confirm I am more than satisfied with my purchase...
I HIGHLY enjoy the fact these came with different sized rubber tips so I can find a size that suits me perfectly. Hardcore points there. The noise cancellation I would say is pretty great as well as long as you get the right fit.. Where I work the break rooms can get pretty loud, with the sound turned up to a decent amount, it drowns out all sounds around me. Couldn’t tell someone was trying to make conversation with me without having the wave me down. The batter life so far has been amazing, really glad this brand went with the Type C charger. The sound quality is pretty good in my opinion, I would prefer a bit more bass, however that’s just me being picky, these do definitely have bass though. Sound quality is overall really good in my opinion. Another factor worth mentioning is the app you can download to utilize an equalizer. This company really put some though and quality parts into this product. For $100 these are REALLY good head phones. I’ve only had a couple phone calls with them on, an from what people on the other end have said, they can hear me just fine. This product deserves its 5 stars in my personal experience. I will provide an updated review after a month or so once I’ve had a bit more time to mess with them. Another great feature I really enjoy personally, whenever I take the headphone out to have a conversation with somebody it stops the music. However whenever I put the headphone back into my ear, my music does not continue to play. Maybe I haven’t figured out how to enable that feature but still, I don’t mind pressing play to resume my music session."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,Better than Airpods!!,"Deep Bass !! Clear Sound!! And the battery life is so good and call quality is good, people hear me super well !!. Anker once again you took my money hehe. Happy with the airbuds"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,These wireless air buds are are well worth the $$!!,"All charged up & ready to go right out of the box! Super easy to pair with my iPhone 11 Pro Max. I have small ear holes and always found Apple ear buds to be uncomfortable. These were very comfortable, again, right out of the box. I did attempt to switch tips to the smaller size, and one size larger, but in the end, I went back to the tips that came on the buds. I find the sounds quality to be very good (for my needs). And I like having the ability to change the bass sound via the app, depending on the type of music I’m listening to. However, the standard/recommended bass is perfectly fine! My hubby liked mine so much, he got himself some Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Wireless Airbuds, too!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,Can You Hear Me Now? I can hear everything!!!!,They had great sound (in 1 ear). I have a One+6 and I could not get them to play through both ears.... Customer service got back to me and sent out another pair... I figured out how to pair both ear pod and the are FANTASTIC! Hands down the best pair of earbuds I have ever owned! You can used the Soundcore App to balance out each ear.. Pick from pre-set EQ setting to get the perfect balance of bass to treble to your taste.... I love these. Battery life is phenomenal too.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,Great sound!,"Great sound and easy to connect. People have no issues hearing me on phone calls. These really do cancel out all background noise. With them in, I cannot hear anything around me. I usually just use one at a time for audio books. Each one automatically connects to my phone the second I remove it from the case. I am very happy with this purchase!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-16,These are awesome.,Great purchase
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-17,Rating & Review,"Great product, best value. Didn't give a 5th star because they don't stay in your ears like the Apple Airpods."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-17,"great price, great quality","I've been using these every day since I got them, have had minimal problems keeping them in my ears, comfortable, good quality"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-02-18,Better than expected,"Picked these up to replace old headphones and couldn’t be happier for the price, only two features missing are transparency and active noise cancelling."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-18,Worth the money! Noise canceling.,Purchased these for my fiancé for use at work in a noisy setting. He says they work great for cancelling out noise and have excellent sound. The box came with an option of smaller clear plastic flexible ear buds that can be swapped out in case you have smaller ears. So far very happy with this purchase.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-18,"Some good, some bad, but in the end not the right fit for me.","I purchased these earbuds after an amazing experience with Soundcore’s Q20s. I carefully looked over the product line, and this seemed about the best in concern of features vs cost. I was a little hesitant about the style, since I’ve generally had troubles with earbuds like this fitting. It’s been awhile, so I figured I’d give it a try. I’m comparing these against my Soundcore Q20s and against my old wired earbuds from apple. It’s not entirely a fair comparison, but it’s what I’ve got. I listen to those Q20s daily at work. As far as the earbuds, I’ve always been particularly found of Apple’s earbuds because they are the only earbuds I’ve tried that felt comfortable in my ears. In addition, I’ve always found them to sound pretty good. I had troubles getting these to fit nicely in my ears. I didn’t always find them that comfortable. I tried every tip size, and none of them were that great. I ended up purchasing aftermarket foam tips which worked better, but didn’t fit in the case. This lead to a situation where I lost the charging case after fumbling around with this setup; as I had to remove the foam tips to put the earbuds in their case, and put them back on when I went to use them. I kept the foam tips in a separate case. Thankfully someone found the case and I returned it to me. I realize this is kind of a personal thing. I did have two other people try them, one of which had a similar feeling as I did about the fit, and the other it worked fine for them. As far as sound quality. It’s obviously not as deep as the Q20s are, but I still felt a little disappointed. I could get them aligned just right and they were okay, but never great. I had someone else try them and they felt similar, but said they were able to adjust the EQ settings for a better sound. To me, the sound wasn’t as full bodied as my apple earbuds were. I didn’t like the touch controls either. I felt like I always hit them by accident while trying to fit the earbuds in, but when I actually tried to use them, I had a difficult time getting them to register. I talked to the Soundcore peeps, and they suggested I try the Liberty 2 pro. I had considered these while making my initial purchase, but felt the Air 2’s were a little more attractive in price. I liked them a lot better though. It’s a similar tip design for the ear, but they have a little wing that fits into the ear to help hold everything in place. I find them to be much more comfortable, and the sound is closer to what I’d hope for; although not perfect. The case is much better too, allowing more room for aftermarket tips; although with the overall design I didn’t feel the need or desire for an aftermarket tip. In conclusion; after some time and deep reflection. The Liberty Air 2 are okay. If the style of tip is something you’ve used before and are comfortable with, then you’ll be fine. (I think my troubles came down more to how they fit; or rather, didn’t fit). However, I would personally recommend looking at the Liberty 2 Pro. I feel they have a better fit overall, sound a little better, and the case is a little better, despite being a little bigger."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-18,"Need a firmware update to improve touch controls, otherwise solid.","Sound quality is nice, I like the security of knowing that my Liberty Air 2's have a 7-hour battery life average, and they excel at noise isolation, but they're not the best for Discord voice chats. The only major gripe that I have with these buds is the touch controls. The app has a neat autopause feature and the EQ settings are nifty, but there honestly shouldn't be any need to customize touch controls if the Air 2's had built in touch controls for:
•Play/pause (1 press)
•Next Track (2 presses on Right)*
•Previous Track (2 presses on Left)*
•Volume Up (Hold for 1s on Right)*
•Volume Down (Hold for 1s on Left)*
•Answer/End Call (1 press)
(*Custom controls should allow you to alternate the controls)
Hopefully there can be a firmware update that incorporates these controls as best as possible, otherwise they just aren't my go-to TWS buds and I'm not getting my money's worth out of it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-18,Great and affordable alternative to Apple Airpods Pro,"Appreciate smaller earbud options that fit my small ear canals, love that I can adjust the EQ and accessibility through the app, good compact case size, battery life is great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-18,Good affordable wireless headphones for general use. Not good for base sounds though.,"I bought these hoping they would be a good alternative to the apple ear pods. They are ok so far, I mostly listen to podcasts, you tube videos. The base is very bad, though, I get noise glitches if I turn the base up. So listening to music, electronic music that has base it does not work well. If you want to listen to music with base, maybe go for a different product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-18,"Pretty good for phone calls, if you’re in quiet surrounding","Week 2.
I bought this primarily for phone calls. I’ve found very few products out there with acceptable mic quality. This is pretty decent
Speaker/Sound quality: Can’t compare to Shure’s. Pretty decent for the price point. Added bonus of having customized volume profiles/levels by ear. I actually find it pretty useful - I dont have the same level of hearing on either ear (most people dont) and having the earpieces customized to that makes a lot of difference when listening to music and during phone calls as well. Noise cancellation: This isn’t ANC, but noise attenuation. Depends upon the fit you find with the earpieces which they provide a few options in the pack. You could always buy 3rd party if you prefer (e.g., Comply). Mic Quality: based on feedback from the other end, excellent when you're in quiet surroundings. Unusable if you're even in reasonably noisy places (e.g., airport gate - had to switch to phone on the ear in couple of instances). I have a wired Bose which worked better in one of those cases. So quality is pretty good, but handling of background noise leaves a lot to be desired
Aesthetics / Looks: Love it
Battery life: haven't tested the limits. I'm pretty happy with it. So.. so far so good!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-19,Working nice,Good for everything
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-19,"Excellent Sound, Excellent Battery, Excellent Value !!!!!","I needed a pair of truly wireless earbuds. These checked all of the boxes. Reasonable price. Beautiful packaging. They easily pair with my pixel 3. They sound great. They are comfortable. They DO NOT drop phone calls. People don't ask if your talking via buds. The touch controls easily work. Battery life excels. They stay in my ears. They keep out noise via the seal not active noise cancellation. They are black and not as noticable as apple. You can use just one if you so choose. I use these at the gym, to talk walks and listen to music and make phone calls. I have not used them to run yet but I think you can without them falling out. I first bought Klipsch. They cost more were uncomfortable and cut in and out while indoors at the gym. I recommend these to absolutely anyone without reservation! Home run!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-20,Can't maintain connection,"The earbuds are fine, but after about two weeks of owning them, they started having issues with videos. One ear would cut out sound, and thwn it would come back and the other ear would cut out. This would keep going and the only way to fix it was to disconnect and reconnect. I had to return them because of this."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-20,Noise Cancellation is OK,The sound quality is great and the features are good as well. My only gripe is that when i took them on BART ( Bay Area Train System) the other person said it was really loud. The noise cancellation only works with low background noise.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-20,Good ear buds,"I really wanted these to be better. I owned and used them for 1 month before returning. They sounded great. I like the punchy bass and good passive noise canceling. They worked well at the gym blocking out ambient sounds. But I was really disappointed with the call quality. I could hear the caller fine, they told me that I sounded like I was talking to them in a tunnel. I used my appl AirPods as the reference standard and these just did not come close to the call quality I was looking for."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-20,Sound quality,Works great sound is awesome
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-20,Major bang for your buck,Love the feel and fit. Excellent sound quality and plenty of volume. Seamless connectivity. Another high quality product from Soundcore.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-02-21,Correct pairing problem,"For those out there having an issue with pairing the left pod, here's a solution. Unpair from device. Next put the pods back in the case. Push the reset button on the bottom of case for 10sec. Light will flash red on both then white. Take out of case hold them together, bluetooth search for pods on device. Both will get recognized. I had the same issue and saw on YouTube what to do. Hope this helps. (See below)
So in order to solve your problem, please help us do the following troubleshooting steps:
1. Forget the pairing record on your device and turn off your device's Bluetooth. 2. Place the earbuds into the charging case and make sure they are being charged. When you put the left earbuds into the charging case, the left LED light on charging case will flash 2 times which means the earbuds is charging, please also note the right side will also do the same time, when you put it into charging case, the right LED light on charging case will also flash. 3. Keep the charging case open, then press and hold the button on the bottom of the charging case for 10 seconds until the LED indicators on both earbuds flash red 3 times. All the memory data will be cleared, then close the charging case. 4. Re-open the charging case or take both sides out of the charging case, the white light on one side will flash quickly, which means it enters pairing mode
5. Enable the Bluetooth on your bluetooth devices. You can find the device name ""Soundbuds Liberty Air 2"" or ""Soundcore Liberty Air 2-L"" on the Bluetooth list. 6. Please click ""Soundbuds Liberty Air 2"" or ""Soundcore Liberty Air 2-L"" for pairing, the white light will flash slowly, which means it paired successfully. 7. Then there will pop out a screen with ""Bluetooth Pairing Request"", just click ""Pair"" (This step is very important)."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-21,Best and most affordable earbud hands down,"I’ve owned a lot of different ear buds including the newest AirPods and newest Sony products but this is hands down the best and most affordable of them all. 1. Sound is in incredible
2. Phone call quality is amazing
3. Battery life is awesome
4. Huge plus is the SoundCore app that lets you customize your sound
5. The package comes with 4 different sizes of ear buds which is amazing"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-21,Good product at first but was defective,"For the price these are a good deal, but apparently lots of them are defective, as mine were."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-21,Perfect For Work or Travel,Bought these to use for work when im on break. Was tired of wired earphones always getting tangled or messed up and had planned to only use these for work. After using the head phones for a few days I never went back to using my wired earphones. They have great sound quality and the perfect volume settings. The noise cancellation is perfect for me but could be better for others who want complete silence. Love the case they come in and fit perfectly in your pocket. High recommend would buy again.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-22,Disappointed,"After trying my husband's earlier model, I purchased the newest liberty 2 model. I was excited and hoping that they would work out, however, after one use, I could never get the left earbud to work. I tried the instructions on resetting and disconnecting from bluetooth and the phone etc. I emailed soundcore and while waiting for a response, I have already returned the earbuds to Amazon via the UPS store today and purchased a different brand of buds from Verizon. Just really disappointed. After conducting Google searches for help, I discovered that, apparently this is a common problem. I was looking for a reliable product to use during my workouts and this was not it for me. No problem with the other equipment, the packaging or battery life....just the left earbud. I have never posted a review, but I have been a loyal Amazon customer since 2015 and felt compelled to review this product. Hope that it is helpful."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-22,"Value, quality, battery life!","Add memory foam ear tips, after that... nothing can compete for value and quality! I had Samsung 2018 wireless icon x, and Liberty Air 2 takes the pot! Look it up... compare and review, you won’t be disappointed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-22,Please think before buying !! Call quality is pathetic !,"Please think twice before buying !!! !Call quality is really poor. As acclaimed in product description, lot of noise is there while making any phone call . Other person on the call is unable to hear the voice properly . Also, pairing is problematic. I am going to return it ASAP."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-23,These are the beasts they sound very good very clear and yeah they're very good very very good,NOTHING !!!!!!!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-23,Love em!,These things will send the apple fanboys crying to their Mama's. Great sound and battery life for the money. Get them as you won't regret it. Easy to hook up!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-23,Bad Bluetooth connectivity,"The sound is great. No complaints there. My biggest complaint is the Bluetooth functionality being so incredibly inconsistent. Every other day I have to reset them and pair to my phone again because it will only connect to the left pod. Other times they won't disconnect after putting them in the case and closing the lid. The room will get quiet for a moment and I'll hear a faint sound coming from my jacket pocket. I get closer to investigate and my music is still streaming from my phone to the headphones while they're inside the case. I've had issues with getting them to stay in my ears, but I've always had that issue (apparently I have strangely shaped inner ears). I'm appreciative of the fact that these come with so many different sized options of tips. I wouldn't recommend these to a friend solely because of the frustrations I have with connectivity."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-24,Great value,"Realiably connects, some distortion. Excellent for podcasts, music and audio books. When making calls , distortion or audio issues on one or both me and my callers end, but overall good for making calls 90+% of the time."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-24,Sound vs Loss,"The sound quality is amazing, but won't stay in my ears or my husband's no matter what we do. I'm afraid I'll lose them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-02-25,Best pair of truly wireless headphones!!!,"Sounnd:
I absolutely love the sound on these. They are by fair the best I've ever had hansdown. The best part is if you don't like the factory settings they have a personalized EQ setting you can mess with plus several different presets. Battery Life:
The battery life on these are truly incredible! One single ear piece lasts for 7 hours depending on what you are doing. Which is the best time I have ever seen on a pair of truly wireless headphones the case also has over 28 hours of charge. I have gone as long as a week before having to charge the headphones again. Quality:
The build feels great! I got the black ones and they have a matte finish on them. The black ones are kind of an oil magnet. But that doesn't bother me. They headphones are interchangable as well. So you can use both
Call Quality:
Both headphones can make and take calls. The mic is a little sensitive. But if your in a quite area that's not a problem. Features:
This says it has some water resistant. I haven't personally tested. The wireless charging I tried once and it didn't seem to catch the charge, but the wireless charger stand was a stand up so I don't think it was sitting right. Another frat feature is the app. It lets you customize the touch sides and it tells you when the headphones need to be updated. Overall: I have no complaints! I love the price. At 100 bucks I would rather pay the money for them then airpods or other top name brands"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-25,Great Product/Great Support,Great product as well as incredible support by Rochelle at Anker/Soundcore.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-02-25,Quality Earphones Comfortable in Ears Featuring Tap Controls,"Overall this is a quality bluetooth earphone set. They have tap controls, not push buttons to press the earpieces deep to in users' ears (a different set I purchased from another brand had buttons.) The app is great that lets you customize controls independently for right and left earpieces, enable/disable auto-pause, update firmware, customizable equalizer that can be trained to users' ears. Sound quality is satisfactory and loud. They fit snug in the ear canals thanks to different diameter rubber tips. I ran and biked with them without the fear of them falling off. They sit comfortably in the ears without causing pressure points in the inner sides of my ears (I only say so because another brand I purchased previously caused such issues, hence I sought to buy these instead.) I tried wearing them in a snowboard/ski helmet, but the earpiece and helmet combo did not sit comfortable in my experience. The charge/carrying case has rooms for improvements the hinge system could be made to snap better, so not to open as easily."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-25,"Great sound quality, battery life, and construction. Calls quality good too!","Had these for about about 2 months now, and I am pleasantly surprised by how good they are. For context, I primarily use them for listening to music and podcasts while commuting. And for that purpose they are great. Regardless of genre, I’ve experienced a high quality and range of sound I would want. And he companion app allows you to tweak this further depending on what you like to hear more of (isolating vocals, de/increased treble, bass, etc). Battery life is also great. I don’t have to change these more than every other 3-4 days with my level of usage (2 hours of Daily commute, 1 hour in gym 3x a week, and 2-3 hours at home/ office listen each day). These earbuds only lose one star from me when it comes to calls in open / noisy spaces. I work in NYC, and on my end, sound quality is great. However, if I take a call in a noisy environment, such as while commuting, I’ve been told that some ambient background noise gets through. Supposedly not enough to be disruptive or deal breaking, but enough to be noticed. So they won’t be as good as AirPod Pros in this department, but are close enough behind to be viable for calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-26,I want to love them but...,"The left one keeps falling out, I can't seem to find the right size tip to keep it in. The sound quality is pretty good but they aren't super loud, but plenty loud. The bass is decent, I still get an oomph but I kinda prefer the soundcore sport when it comes to bass (those are not completely wireless free, but are bluetooth). The battery life is the saving grace if you need an earbud thats going to last an 8 hour shift, this will do it for sure. Just charge the earbud during ur lunch or break and you're set. You can also use one earbud at a time which is a good feature. And the noise cancelling is alright despite it not being an actual highlight of the earbuds. I do recommend them, I just hope they fit you better than they do me. Update 3/13/2020
Anker customer service is excellent. They reached out and offered to send me rubber tips as soon as they become available for the liberty air headphones. They also exceeded expectations and made sure I was satisfied with a pair of liberty 2s which I would recommend over the liberty airs"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-26,"Good sound, good fit, great call quality","These are almost perfect. They are the best all around Bluetooth headphones I've had, and I've had a bunch. I use Bluetooth headphones all day every day for work, mostly listening to music or podcasts, but I also have to take calls on them during the day and having a headset that doesn't pick up all the background noise is number 1 importance for me. This headset takes takes care of that for me. I have used the LG neckband type for a few years, and they were also very good with calls and sounded great, but the cords to the neckband are too fragile, and after a couple months of heavy use I keep breaking them. And at $150+ each you would expect them to last longer. So I decided to try the stand-alone headphones. I've tried several different brands/styles and although some are more comfortable than others, and some sound better than others and some look better than others, these are the first that people don't complain about background noise when on the phone, and they also feel, sound and look good. They last about 6 hours on a charge and charge back up very fast. They sound very good. Decent bass and good noise cancelling. Fit is nice. Can wear them all day without any discomfort. One thing I do wish they had was pass-through. When they are in my ears I can't hear anything outside of them so conversation is difficult even with only one in. All in all, these have been very good all around and with the added bonus of call quality I'll probably stick with these for my next headphones purchase once these call it a day."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-26,Good but expected more for the price,"I've been searching for the best pair of wireless earbuds that can be used in stereo or mono, for the gym, commute, travel, etc. So I've purchased multiple pairs from different brands. There is one feature that I find particularly useful in this pair, which is that it can detect when you remove one earbud and the music automatically pauses when that happens. However, while the touch controls are pretty customizable, I also find them a bit limiting. You have 4 controls...""double tap"" or ""touch and hold"" for each ear. If you want volume control, you must use 2 of the control slots (can't choose only volume up or only volume down). This forces the user to prioritize which is more important. I feel like this should include customizable options for single tap, which cannot be used on this device. So do I double tap for next track on right ear, double tap for previous track on left ear, tap and hold for pause/play? I'm assuming the company deliberately excluded controls for single tap to avoid accidental touch but it's a bit annoying. I will knock off 1 star for this. In terms of sound...it sounds good overall, but the highs are a slightly too high for me, and the bass is there but not as deep as other models. I love my bass so I need to knock off 1 star for this. Comfort: ok, this pair is pretty comfortable. The rounded design of the piece that the earbud tips connect to settle in your ear extremely comfortably and I'm sure they wont budge for any kid of workout. If you prioritize comfort over anything else, give these a try. I text more than I talk on the phone and didn't try the calls on this unit. I will most likely be returning these. I also ordered the Liberty Pro 2 and will try them out. As of right now, I would suggest giving Enacfire G20 a try. All the touch control options you could ever want, and very deep bass."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-26,Easy to pair.,Nice charging case.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-02-26,Good but not for people who need a lot of bass,"My second try at getting a set of bluetooth earbuds. Had a different brand and it was just ok, pretty much first gen bluetooth earbuds. I am quite satisfied as the sound quality of these earbuds good and crisp, my only complaint is that the bass does not hit as hard as I would like. At this price point, it is a good buy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-26,Great Head phones,I love these things. The battery life is better than expected for the ear buds. the sound quality is also very good. they also fit better than another well known brand. They hold well even when exercising.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-26,Terrible call quality on the other end,"I tried using these to call someone the day i got them. it was at night in my house with two kids sound asleep. He heard EVERY STEP I TOOK. i thought maybe they are too isolated so i turned on a sink to see if it would catch that and cancel it... NOPE. These wouldn't be good to make calls in a library because the other end will hear the pages turning. Really disappointed as i usually buy real cheap headphones and this is one of the more expensive ones i have bought. they were moderately comfy, after installing the app the sound quality was decent. noise canceling is less comfortable than 'active' alternatives."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-27,a surprise,"I don't use headphone often. At around $100, this ear set is a bargain. I do not know how they fit such rich sound in this tiny ear pieces. I was pleasantly surprised."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-27,Not for phone calls. Great for listening.,I bought these to use for phone calls. I read reviews that said these would work. They did not work for me. I called support and they were very helpful but shared that these were designed for listening and voice calling was secondary. The quality of the devices and support are excellent. They just are not the right choice for someone who needs to be understood in phone calls.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-27,Okay but not for me,Connection problem
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-27,Apple alternative,Happy with them. Wife has small ears and they bother her after long use. She is very happy with them overall
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-27,Awesome sound but connecting doesn’t work,I love these earbuds all except the fact that most the time I have to forget the device in my Bluetooth settings and have to repair them. Other wise I’d give them a five star review.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-27,Great earbuds.,I like design and sound quality.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-28,It's awesome,"I have compared with AirPods Pro. It shows better in sound quality and comfortably wearing than AirPods Pro. Although no ANC, its sharp is perfectly fitting my ear and well isolate noise, just like ANC function."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-02,These are amazing!,Much better quality sound than AirPods. You won’t be disappointed!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-02,Simply awesome,"I got to admit.... This product is amazing. If you cannot use apple earpods because of them not staying in your ear, get these right away.. they are awesome and cheaper than apples costly listing products. You can use them individually, the battery life is great and most importantly they sound terrific.. please get these right away if your on the fence. This product is built well to..I should have perchased these on the first day launched. Soundcore you have done it once again. I'm a happy customer. thank you for giving customers great products without breaking the bank. Awesome."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-02,Bluetooth connectivity is an issue,"I am really disappointed to have to return these. I read all of the reviews about trouble with bluetooth connectivity. However, the service & tech reviews plus cost pushed me to buy them. Out the box, setup was super easy. They connected in via bluetooth in a moment, which was great. I used them for about a week with no issue. Sound was great. No transparency, but I knew that. Unfortunately, not long after, they disconnected from bluetooth for no apparent reason. Also, unfortunately, before a long flight. I tried resetting and reconnecting multiple times over several days. My phone would only recognize one. After many attempts, it finally recognized both but will only connect with one. I have given up... I need any easy, reliable connection."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-03-02,"Excellent sound for music, serious near-dealbreaker problems for calls.","For the second time I find myself buying an Anker bluetooth sound product, and finding that they don't live up to the expectations I have from my experiences with their other products. These earbuds seem well engineered, but just haven't been sufficiently tested. My review reflects my experiences using these with my phone, a Samsung Note 8.
First, the positive. I find the whole package very well put together, charging with the USB-C connector and the wireless receiver is fast and easy. The case fits neatly in a coin pocket, and quickly charges the buds from its own battery. Other reviews complaining that it wastes energy charging them continuously are just wrong -- it charges the buds only until they're full and then stops (this is a safety issue with lithium batteries). The sound is *excellent*. I'm no jaded audiophile, but these earbuds are among the best sounding I've ever tried, and I've lost count of how many that is over the years. Audio is perfectly matched to videos I'm watching, zero detectable delay across the bluetooth connection to my phone. The fit is quite good in my ears; these are very lightweight and I've had no trouble with them falling out. On rare occasions they'll fail to connect with my phone. In those situations I'll put them back in their case, pull them out again, and they connect normally. This has happened a few times in the couple months I've owned them, and I use them almost every day, typically putting them in a few times per day. I've had other earbuds with worse connection problems than these, by far. The problem is with calls; these earbuds just don't work as advertised (or at all, in many cases). My expectations when I chose these are relevant: I really wanted earbuds to use for calls in noisy environments. So I needed a product that would go in both ears and isolate them, and with noise-cancelling mics. I'm okay with using just passive noise suppression (i.e. rubber ear tips) for blocking noise to my own ears, and I needed a way to reduce background sound from the mic so I'm not sending it to the person I'm talking to. Unfortunately using these earbuds in a noisy environment is almost a moot point, because I can't make calls with both earbuds in place. It simply doesn't work. With both earbuds in, the other party can't hear me at all more than half the time, and when they can hear me, it cuts out randomly while we're talking - both the sound I hear from them, AND what they hear from me. I have to take out one earbud and put it in the case when I get a call, and half the time that'll be the earbud that happens to be connected to the phone, causing the one I've left in my ear to have to disconnect and reconnect to the phone directly, several seconds during which I can't hear or be heard. And of course if I have only one earbud in, then the solution is not great for noisy environments, unless I carry around an earplug for the other ear. So if I have both earbuds in at the moment I get a call (phone, Skype, Zoom, Hangouts, every app I've tried), I have to very quickly find the case, rip out one earbud and put it in the case and close it, and hope that the other earbud is either already connected directly, or can reconnect quickly enough for me to answer the call in time. Calls work well with only one earbud, but this is just not something I should have to put up with for a hundred dollar product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-02,Good price point for the function,"Good sound quality. Doesn't quite capture bass as well, but as to be expected with ear buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-03,Battery life,Best I've heard
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-03,Amazing for the price best ones I own,These things work great love them highly recommend sound is great
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-03,Best one's I've purchased!,"I have used these just about everyday since New years, so for about 3 months. The call quality is great, the sound is fantastic. I am still trying to find the right size of the ear piece to keep them in my ear a little better, but really...for the money, this is the best pair you can get."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-03,Noise cancellation needs work,Really like everything but the noise cancellation is not very good.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-04,Glad I bought them,"I bought these as a replacement for some horrible Skullcandy Indy's (Never buy those!) And it's the like going from a bicycle to a motorcycle. More comfortable, easier to control, better sound, everything. And you're left wondering, Why'd I even bother with the other thing? My only complaint is the controls are limited to 2 programmable settings. But the sound customization is awesome. The battery life is great. I workout with these and never had a problem."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-04,Best,Best headset out here
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-05,Comprable to competitors but not as advertised battery life,This are sure very good features and quality comprable to Apple’s AirPod but wished their battery life was as advertised even if it’s only off by 1hr. My experience was only at maximum of 4:30 to 5 hrs
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-05,Decent earphones with less than ideal battery life,"Sound quality is decent. Ear tip that came with the earphones have very poor seal, and I replaced with comply foam tip that works well. The issue is that earphones with comply foam tip will not fit in the case to charge. I have to remove tips each time. I hope Anker thought about this when designing the case to fit variety of tips. Battery life in real use is about 4hours, which is not what I expected."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-05,Excellent TWS earbuds,"I've been using these earbuds for about 2 weeks. Overall, these are a very good headphones with a few minor issues. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Pros:
- Sound: Some of the best sounding bt headphones I've owned. Sound is subjective, and I'm not an audiophile...but trust me when I say these sound amazing. I was tempted to give these 5 stars based on sound alone. - Phone calls: Finally, a pair of bt headphones that handle phone calls very well! People on the other end of my calls do not know I'm using headphones. The call quality has been great. - Battery: Battery life is consistent with the advertised 7 hours. The fact that the case uses wireless charging makes charging these a non-issue for me. A USB-C charging port (which I never use) is also a plus. The case battery life is so good that I've only had to charge it a couple of times since I've had these. Very impressed. - Connectivity: I haven't had any issues pairing these with my Pixel 3. It even prompted me to pair the left earbud immediately after I paired the main (right) earbud. If you want to use these in mono mode, just remember to put the other earbud back in the case and close it. It's been a very simple process. I recommend reading the manual if you're having issues. - Soundcore App: The app allows you to customize the sound equalizer and the controls on the earbud. HearID is a pretty slick feature that really personalizes the listening experience. I find myself going back and forth between the Signature EQ setting, and HearID. I've haven't played around with the custom EQ much as I haven't felt a need for it. The app also allows for firmware updates. My earbuds have received 2 firmware updates since I've owned them. One was for improved call quality, and the other added additional custom eq settings (treble) as well as bug fixes. This tells me the people at Soundcore are actively trying to make improvements to their product. Thumbs up! - Comfort: The earbuds are very light and fit snug in the ear. I can wear them for a long time (3+ hours) with very little ear fatigue. - Look and Build quality: These look great! I especially like the black ones. The build quality of the case and earbuds is solid. They do not feel cheap at all. The size of the case is perfect, and It's easily pocketable. Cons:
My only con is nitpicky, but it's enough for me to keep from giving these 5 stars. - Controls: While the touch controls work well and can be customized using the app, they are limited in my opinion. Each bud can have 2 controls assigned to them. One for double-tapping and one for long pressing (2 sec). That gives the buds a total of 4 control options. If you want to control volume with double taps (right-vol up / left - vol down), then you are only left with 2 other controls for long pressing. You have to choose from Play/Pause, Skip forward, Skip backward, and Voice Assistant. You have to sacrifice 2 control options. Why? A simple remedy would be to add a single-tap or triple-tap option. If the developers improve on this in a future firmware update, I'll up my rating to 5 stars. If you're on the fence about buying these, I can assure you they are well worth the money. These are feature-rich high-quality truly wireless earbuds at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-05,very good,good enough
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-05,Good product,For the short time I have used the product I am very satisfied.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-05,Recommended!!,Recommended .. for a truly wireless earbuds that can be wirelessly charged with this amazing finishing and quality of sound plus it's less than $100 .. so yeah recommended indeed 👌🏾
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-05,Good but not great,"Not as good sound quality as the Soundcore Spirit X. EQ app nice but sound is artificial, not full like my Spirit X."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-06,Great sound! USE THE APP!,I sat and watched endless amounts Rd of review videos to try and decide on a pair of earbuds to purchase and after purchasing and returning a pair I found these. Now let me say if you dont like the huge plastic bulging style of most earbuds you will be happy with these while not missing any of the excellent features that most other buds have. And I cannot stress enough DOWNLOAD AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE APP! There is a EQ mode on the app that tests your hearing and gives you a personalized setting and wow it just changes the whole listening experience. I would highly reccomend you try these buds of you'd like a cheaper price tag with high quality sound.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-06,Liberty Air 2,"The battery life is amazing! This is my first pair of wireless earbuds, but I am very impressed with the sound quality and the fit."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-06,Great earbuds!,They fit well in my small ears and do not fall out. I like all the options for EQ settings and changing the touch shortcuts. Great sound especially for wireless. They are easy to pair and charge. The battery lasts for ages. My only complaint is that I wish the ear pieces had small air holes so the pressure wouldn’t build in my ears. It sometimes makes it a little uncomfortable for long use
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-06,Good Airpods alternative,Lots of nice features. Quality very good. missing mic volume setting.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-07,"Decent battery, average sound.","If you're an audiophile, look elsewhere. These headphones are mediocre when it comes to sound reproduction, but still very good for this price point. Where these do shine is the overall package. They are decently comfortable to wear for light exercise, have decent battery life, and the charging case only makes it better. Some issues I've encountered so far has to deal with touch sensors and connection. They don't always work like you think they should, possibly due to user error. The lack of feedback on press makes you second guess your input. Also, sometimes one earbud may not connect to the source. This can be remedied by rebooting the earbud, but still an annoyance."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-07,Not the best option.,"I returned these in favor of the Amazon Echo Buds. No pass through on these so you don’t have the option to hear your surroundings. Sound quality was poor compared to the Alexa buds, even with choosing different options in the app. Multiple connection problems. Try the Echo Buds you’ll like them better !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-07,Fit good,Fit good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-07,Nice earbuds,Nice earbuds but the BT connection is not stable
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-07,"Good for music, questionable for business phone calls",Sound quality is great for me. The microphone is not great for phone calls in my car. Many of my clients complained of poor sound quality on their end during our phone calls.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-07,Decent headphones,"I really like them. Decently made, last forever, charge wirelessly. But even after adjusting the ear plugs still fall out of my ears. Also I don't like the tight ear blocking, I start hearing my own sounds, hear bit and it's very distracting."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-09,Microphones are great,What most reviews fail to indicate is how well these work for making phone calls. I have tried a number of wireless headphones and so far most have left me and the people trying to hear me on the other end of the phone call want me to adjust my headset mic. Since purchasing these headphones I have not had anyone indicate they could not hear me clearly or loud enough. Everyone has indicated crystal clear communication and could not believe I was on wireless headphones likes these. I would highly recommend these to anyone.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-03-09,Low sound quality!,Sound quality is low.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-03-09,Great sound but buds didn't work for my ears,Everything was great they kept falling out of my ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-09,Impressive,"After reading and watching the reviews on you tube and online.... Initial impressions of these earbuds are AMAZING! the sound, the smart capabilities... Wow!!! This is a great get away from mainstream devices."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-09,"good, but not a sports earbud","good noise abatement, but not noise cancelling. Great sound and one can tune it to ones hearing. Not really a sports ear bud, as they tend to fall out when one is sweating a lot."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-10,Spotty bluetooth,Bluetooth is spotty. It has to be placed just a certain way or it will skip like crazy.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-10,Battery life not good and they won't stay turned off,"The soundcore app to customize sound was very lack luster. The sound for audio of music or podcast was fine, however for having ""3 microphones"" it does not have great voice quality for folks on the other end. My biggest problem is the battery life. A full charge and only 2 hours later, no use just on stand by they are at 60%. I turn them off and they turn themselves back on just hanging on a neck band (using that to keep from losing when not in use.) disappointed and will be returning."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-10,Great sound quality at a great price,Great sound quality and easy to use! I like how the wireless ear buds are small and they give you several sizes for the silicone ear tips.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-10,Customer Service and follow through is excellent - 5 stars plus!,"I purchased these earbuds for someone else in January. Last week I was told that one of the earbuds was not working so I called Anker. The Customer Service Representative was excellent and I would give her 5 stars for sure. She was personable, intelligent and efficient. She immediately asked some questions and told me they would replace the unit after I returned the defective set, using the Priority One Day prepaid mailing label she was sending through email. Within 10 minutes of hanging up, I received the label. The set was mailed Friday, 3/6, and today, 3/9, I received notice that the replacement has been shipped. I cannot make an opinion about the quality of the earbuds since they weren't mine. But, I would venture to guess the person they were purchased for was happy with them because he asked for a replacement rather than ask for a refund."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-10,"Overall great, except for the annoying static noises","I bought this product mainly for phone calls. Pros:
- High quality build
- They look great
- They fit great
- Good microphone quality (relative to true wireless earbuds)
- Good sound quality, but I'm not an audiophile
- Amazing battery life
- Great price
Cons:
- Noise cancellation is not perfect
- Super annoying static noises sometimes occur when making phone calls. The only reason for 3 stars is the annoying static noises. I've had the product replaced and tried all troubleshooting steps - nothing solved this and this is infinitely annoying. I'm making calls using a Huawei P30 device."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-11,Good price for the quality,"Easy pairing, took me like 4 seconds. Sound quality is really good, the bass is amazing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-11,Great true wireless buds,"I've used Soundcore wireless buds before. Though they were usually the ones with the wire going around my neck. The touch controls were my reason for making this purchase and after close to a month of use, I happy with them. My only complain is once in a while, while not playing anything, a loud static noise blasts my ears. It scares the hell out of me. I'm not sure if this a defect or what, but this prevents me from giving it a 5 star."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-11,Sound quality is not the best,The sound quality is what I expected for a $100 ear buds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-03-11,"Good sound, Initial Pairing is a disaster... premium price but not premium specs","These sound great, but they are not quite what I was expecting or hoping for. Pros:
Great sound. Soundcore app works great and can adjust EQ and controls. This was one of the primary reasons I bought these. Wireless charging a plus. Cons:
Much bigger than I had hoped. The initial pairing was a disaster. Very finicky. See below. The tail sticks straight forward on me, rather than pointing down making them look like handsfree headsets on both ears. Probably just my ergonomics. Touch controls are very touchy. I might just disable them. HearID is a joke. It recommended a flat eq. No difference between the HearID and flat settings. Sticking with my own custom EQ.
Kinda pricy in comparison to several other brands that have great options at near half the price. Premium price should have premium specs like audio passthrough. Here's some things I learned:
1. when pairing for the first time, be sure that the LEFT earbud is already paired to the right earbud. ie: the left lights should not be blinking fast, only the right one, before connecting from your device. If they are both blinking fast and you attempt to pair to your phone you will get EITHER the left or the right to pair only, but not both. If you get into this mode, you must reset the earbuds. 2. if proper pairing occurs, you should see only one discoverable device during the pairing process ""Liberty Air 2"". If you see TWO devices (""Liberty Air 2"" and ""Liberty Air 2 - L"") then you must reset the buds to continue as the situation in #1 will occur (or wait to see if the left pairs with the right). 3. if only one device appears during pairing (""Liberty Air 2"") then the pairing should work. You should be able to pair it and then see a prompt to pair the other earbud (""Pairing Request: Liberty Air 2 - L"") click ""pair"" on the second request to have a complete and proper pairing. How to reset:
If you can't get them to pair or you're getting only one side (either left or right) then you must reset them. Do this:
1. place them both back in the case. Close lid. Let sit a few seconds. Click ""forget this device"" for any existing pairing configs on your phone's bluetooth settings to remove past failed/improper pairing configs. 2. open case and press the button on the bottom. HOLD the button for several seconds until both buds are in pairing mode and blinking fast. 3. remove the buds and hold them in your hand. watch them as the left pairs with the right and the blinking stops on the left (but continues on the right one). In this mode you can now pair to your phone. If this doesn't happen, reset them again but hold the button longer (10 secs?). 4. open your bluetooth settings and you should see only one discoverable device ""Liberty Air 2"". click it to pair it. You should immediately get another pairing request for ""Liberty Air 2 - L"" which you now must accept by clicking pair. 5. Enjoy. I hope this helps someone. Very frustrating process that could be improved upon (and needs to be)."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-11,Need better inspection before send to buyer.,Experiencing very low volume not sure about this product.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-11,Great alternative for AirPod Pros,Purchased 3 different wireless headphones before sticking with the Soundcore Liberty Air 2’s. Love the app to be able to adjust the treble and bass. Love being able to use either headphone. Clear calls. Great battery life so far and wireless charging is very convenient at night. I have small ears so they can get a little uncomfortable after wearing for long period of time but other than that love them!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-11,Recommend it,It is not perfect but very good for listening to music
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-11,Great for the Money,"I never write reviews but really like this product, so wanted to write something about it. First I am glad that I did not buy them from Amazon but from Best Buy. The first pair I bought did not sync, as is the issue with some of the other reviews I have read. I took that pair back to Best Buy and got a new pair, as the ones I had were defective. I then had the Best Buy rep sync both pair and love them. My two boys have the Apple ones, as that is the trendy thing to have. Aside from looking like Ben Stiller in that movie ""Something about Mary,"" the apple ones just don't fit like these do and feel as if they are going to fall out. Just a great product for more than half the price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-12,Great sound. Great headset. Earbuds work great independently or paired!,"This is a great headset. Absolutely love it. The sound is great for the price. Very loud, great highs, deep lows. I read a lot of reviews online, that people were having trouble pairing the earbuds to eachother. The earbuds paired automatically to eachother. I did not need to do anything to get them go do so. I believe that the issue people are having is, my phone ""fails"" to connect to the 2nd earbud (whichever one I connect 2nd) but they are properly pairing to eachother. They work together, and independently, without issue. Very happy with this purchase"

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-12,Best sound quality for the price and size.,Very excecitive looking ear buds with minmalistic design.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-14,Nice price for a first pair,Love them. My first pair of true wireless earbuds. Very reasonable price and nice solid quality for a beginner at this type of technology. Battery life is great. So glad I bought these instead of spending a fortune on another brand.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-14,"Good for the money, BUT.....","The wireless earbuds are great for the money but one thing keeping me from giving a full 5 stars. They receive interference from nearby wifi routers somehow. I would've exchanged them out sooner but recognized this issue a week too late, no returns are closed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-14,Nice addition but have one issue with these...,Love these ear buds only issue I have is they dont stay in my ear. I've tried all the ear pieces and for some reason I cant get to keep a good tight seal. Would not recommend these for the gym.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-15,Amazing except for the sound,"I love everything but the sound. Amazing comfort. Great battery life. She'll
Sleek design. Unfortunately, when you get to a mid range or higher volume, it actually sounds hollow and scratchy. I haven't tried more or less expensive true wireless earbuds. Just feel like this one leaves me wondering why I spent 100 plus an 11 warranty."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-16,Good when they work,"Received this item twice. I like them, sound is good with the app, fit is comfortable, lightweight. HOWEVER, 1st item: background noise cancelation did not work whatsoever. Emphasized all background noise even when I was in areas that were not that loud. Called into customer service using the earbuds and the rep offered a replacement immediately. 2nd item: Replacement came used, missing parts such as charging cord and silicone tips. These earbuds had a different technical malfunction, crackling/static noise. Not sure if I want to try again for a 3rd time. Returning both."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-16,So far impressive,"the buds are great, very comfortable fit, sound quality pack in the small earbuds is amazing. Only issue I am still figuring out is how to switch between tw connected phones without having to disconnect the one device. Im guessing they dont run in parallel like other sets that connect automatically. Other than that it worth the money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-16,Waiting for replacement,Received these with earwax on them and a very scratched case. Called and talked to an Anker rep and she was very nice and helpful. Update* they will be sending a new pair!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-03-17,Dont buy,These have terrible sound quality. I bought them for business calls because they have a good rating on call quality. People on the other end said I sounded muffled.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-17,Great quality and great sound!,"These Soundcore Liberty 2 headphones are awesome. I was about ready to breakdown and get some AirPod Pros but then decided to do a little more homework. The Liberty 2's kept popping up so I started digging heavily into their quality, sounds, reviews, etc. Well I can say that all the reviews I read were spot on. These things sound amazing, have a fantastic build quality, the battery life is outstanding, and I'm loving them! I'm glad I searched and saved me some serious money by going with these. They're not cheap but they are a hell of a value comparatively speaking. I don't know what AirPod Pro's are like but I don't care. I'm a happy customer. Thanks, Anker!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-17,They sound good.,"Every now and again one side drops out, the case charges pretty quick. The ear buds fall out and that's not good these days.... using the larger rubber thing is to big."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-17,Great for calling and music,"Great for the price, compared to Apple's Air pods. I've used both and the only difference to me, was the noise canceling feature which, personally I don't need. I like to be aware of my surroundings and I feel its more safe. With the noise canceling, the sound quality is good but turning it off still sounds a lot better. If I want true noise canceling and big thumping sounds for music, I'd go with the big headphones like the Bose. Easy set-up and connectivity. Make sure to download the app. It has good useful settings that other makers don't. I chose the SoundCore liberty 2 over the Liberty 2 pro because these are better to make calls on when you do use it to call. I personally think if i really wanted big sounds for music, I'd just not use headphones and listen on my big sound system, and its some what more safe/comfortable for my ears. These DO NOT have noise canceling but they keep sound out just fine. They sound good, loud and clear when listening to music. There are different sound settings in the app which is a nice bonus over other brands. My only complaint is, wearing long periods, it is uncomfortable and I need to take them out. Not sure if better ear pieces or material or molding shape would make it more comfortable for my ears. They do come with a few plastic sizes which are nice, but I've tried them all and aren't comfortable for long wear usage. I would recommend these for the budget and quality. If these ever break, I probably try another brand, only because I'd want to see if other brands will feel more comfortable in my ear."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-18,Impressed,Great all around for the price. Very pleased.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-03-18,A great value sounds better than 300 dollar wireless earbuds,The sound is fantastic!! And the EQ gives me options !! The battery life is way better then Apple air pods any day .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-18,Worth the money.,I needed a good set of headphones for the office and the gym. These fit the bill for both. Very happy with my purchase. Definetly recommend.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-18,Both pods would never connect at same time.,From day one my daughter could not get both pods to connect to her iphone xr. We have many other bluetooth devices we have connected to her phone so its not our first rodeo. The instruction page was very vague but we followed the instructions to a T and we can only get one bud to connect at a time. The return policyvwas only a month so after trying to get them to work properly over and over we ran out of time to exchange. Now stuck with $99 non working pods. Not happy.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-20,Nice but could use a little more noise blocking,I like the charging case and the customizable ability of each headset. Could cancel more noise though and they can get a little uncomfortable during prolonged wear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,Connect each earbud to different phone,Ability to connect one to my work phone and one to my personal phone. Great and comfortable fit.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,Perfecto!!! De muy buena calidad.,Muchas gracias. Exactamente lo qué pedí. Muy buen producto.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,Good battery life,"I like these earbuds. They're comfortable to wear and produce really good sound. Noise cancellation is OK, not terrific, but good for this price. I'm really happy with the battery life."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,Better battery life than the previous model,"I previously owned the soundcore liberty air but lost them so decided to upgrade to the 2. Both units behave and work the same. Easy setup and use. The battery life on the liberty air 2 is much improved and the case charged via USB C which is much faster. Also removing the earbud now pauses music, very nice feature."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,Love them.,I got these due to watching my favorite Youtuber Flossy Carter and they didn’t disappoint.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-20,Long battery life,excellent battery life but couldn't get a tight enough fit for my ears despite being offered 4 sizes of silicone tips
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,Battery and clear sounds.,I recommend to anyone who wants to be buy airbag (earphones)
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-21,Amazing sound quality,"These ear pods are perfect. They charge quickly and retain their charge for a long time. They pair quickly with all devices. The sound quality is wonderful whether I'm watching a video, listening to music or a podcast, or even meditating. I love them already!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-21,Distance of bluetooth connexion,The distance of Bluetooth connexion is not so perfect just 6 m and begin to deconect i hope for beter update
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-21,Excelentes audifonos,Muy buenos audifonos sobre todo el precio
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-21,Amazing,"I really love this earphones! The battery life is amazing and the sound quality is awesome. I had issues with using just the left ear alone, but I had a live chat with anker customer service and they guided me in setting it up and i can use either ear separately... and did I mention that the battery life is amazing?! Yes it is! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-21,Best wireless earphones for the buck,Great earphones for listening to music and videos. Almost no latency
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-21,Great Air Pod alternatives if they actually fit your ear,"Sound quality for days , phone calls are crystal clear. This product comes with more than enough ear tips for all the ears in the world but mine. I have rotated through all the tips and even ordered some additional ones (extra small) thinking that would make it better. I just cant get these to stay in, some days I can and they work like a charm but I never know if its going to be one of those days or not. BUt Like I said before if they fit you will not need another pair of bluetooth headphones ever."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-22,TRULY AMAZING sounds for price. NO WAY TO RELEASE EAR CANAL PRESSURE WHEN PLACING THEM IN YOUR EAR.,"When you put these earbuds in there is no way to let the sure pressure out of your ear canal. I thought that I would be able to find a way to release the pressure somehow. But I haven't so, I don't use them as much as I would if that problem was fixed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-22,Great but with very clear issues,"I, overall, am happy with my purchase and I will not return them. But, keep this in mind:
1.There is no easy way to switch between devices you have paired the headphones with. I thought the app would have allowed such a function but it seems that feature is exclusive to Apple's own headphones. 2. The personalized HearID is great.But if you have to push the headphones in, it starts to become very empty sounding. I must have just placed my headphones in my ear instead of digging into my ear canal. Make sure your HearID matches to how deep you have the headphones in your ear on a regular basis. 3. The noise cancellation is somewhat there because of the shape of the tips. But there is no ACTIVE noise cancellation. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-22,Good quality,"Great sound quality, appreciate different size buds"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-22,Comfortable and great sound.,I spend a lot of time on conference calls. These are comfortable and long lasting. The sound quality is superb. Balance is great keeping the sound stage centered in my head.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-22,Good deal,Amazing product
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-23,"Extra case charger needed, mmmmmaaaaaannnnnnn",Good pair or ear buds but I need an extra charging case. No wear to be found. I use mine mainly for jogging. Sound is good but you don't hear anyone coming up from behind. Both plugs in playing Soca automatically makes you want to dance in your own world.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-23,Great Value - Exceptional Customer Service,"Overall pleased with the headphones, but I don't have a comparison of other headphones like Apple AirPods. Had to engage customer service, and they were phenomenal. Highly recommend for the value and the customer service."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-23,OH MY,"such premium build true wireless earbuds
- sound quality awesome, adjustable EQs with app
- wonderful mic is deliver great voice with road noise filtered
Recommanded!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-24,Amazing product,I absolutely love it
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,0,2020-03-24,"Seriously, just buy airpods","Hahahahahahah! These are seriously the worst headphones I've ever owned. The bluetooth connection on the Liberty Air 2 is the worst experience known to man. I consider myself to be fairly tech saavy, I have no idea why I would've just assumed these would ""just work"". It's literally the worst headphone I've ever owned and anybody who tells you otherwise is flat out lying. Fix your bluetooth connection. Orders airpods."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-25,Good buds,"Comfortable and good sound, iphone battery lasts about 1hr"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-26,Great ear buds,"Great sound quality and the mic works great. Mine required a firmware update out of the box to access all the features from the app, just an fyi"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-26,Custom setup,I’m very happy with these. I replaced my Bose with these and so far I’m happy. The hearing test to set up the custom sound is nice as my left ear is much worse than my right and it can balance for that. Great sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-26,Great Ear Buds,Very comfortable ear buds and very good audio. Also easy to connect via BT and answering phone calls.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-27,Fantastic Earbuds,These are some fantastic earbuds! Totally worth the money. The sound quality is so crisp and clear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-27,Anker nailed it with the equilizer app.,"Very well balanced and can be tweeked to your liking, bass, trebele mids can be adjusted. The good part is equilizer is responsive and you really feel the difference. Soundstage is pretty good and the price is unbeatable. These sound better than airpod Pro's."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-03-27,It was great for about 5 weeks,"Purchased for work, as I was part time remote (now full time) and wanted something small that I could keep with me. I did some searching and these seemed like they would be a good fit for the business calls and meetings I needed them for. For the first few weeks I was also very happy with how they performed in that application. However, after those few weeks of use I started getting connectivity issues and sound quality COMPLETELY tanked. Both incoming and outgoing audio took a massive nose dive, and hasn't recovered over the last month or so. I have a lot of issues getting them to connect at all sometimes, and others the audio is bad enough that I simply have to find another option during meetings. If I have to give any sort of long winded answer I have been informed that the terrible audio is a distraction at best, and keeping people from understanding the audio at all at worst. This happens when connected directly to my phone or computer. Overall quite disappointed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-27,Works for me.,They fit well and the silicone is comfortable and feel like other silicone tipped ear buds that I have used in the past
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-30,"Terrible product, does not last over a few months.",This headset was great... for a whole 3 months. The battery on the left headphone has completely died and will no longer charge.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-30,"Great overall system from how they fit, sound, storage and charge.","Super wireless earbuds for my Samsung phone. I use them working out. They fit and sound great. The only issue i had was that it took a little bit of time to figure out how to sync the two ear buds, but eventually it became clear."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-30,Great alternative quality earbuds and great customer service,"I was in the market for high quality wireless earbuds within a $100 price point, and the Anker Soundcore Liberty Airs were exactly what I was looking for. I found a few options that I thought would meet my needs, but what stood out to me about the Liberty Airs was actually the reviews on the customer service provided by Anker. I ended up having an accident that damaged the earbuds, and the Anker customer service was very fast to respond to my inquiries and help me replace my earbuds. I'm extremely impressed with the battery life of both the charging case and earbuds themselves, and the sound quality is great. The earbuds fit quite well in my ears, and they stay in while I run on a treadmill, which has always been an issue for me with any earbuds. Great product!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-31,I really like these -,"I am really happy with my purchase. Wireless earbuds are a great addition to your EDC equipment. Sound quality is excellent for both music and calls. I like the equalizer feature on the soundcore app. I am really happy with my purchase. Keeping them in the case is the best way to prevent losing them, so I like that the case is small enough to carry in my pocket without being bulky. I needed help resetting them recently and the online customer service was excellent. I used the chat feature and they walked me through the reset in about 5 minutes. For the price I feel like I got a great product
Jason"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-31,Word of Caution before Buying,"EDIT/UPDATE
IF you want a good product, at a good price, BUT might have to deal with a return, then these are for you. AKA if you are willing to sacrifice some time for a good product these are for you

Original Review
They sound great....when they work
I have had 2 major issues with these headphones. 1) They have problems getting both to connect sometimes
the BIGGER PROBLEM
2) The right earbud no longer charges (about 2 months of use). I have tried to clean out the case to make sure there is nothing in the case, I have cleaned the contacts, nothing works. So now I only have half of the headphones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-31,My new favorite pair of Truly Wireless Stereo Earbuds,"These sound really good, and they really can compete against other truly wireless earbuds in the market, especially Airpods. I really love these with my Note 9 (these have AptX). The overall construction is plastic, but most of the exterior plastic is matte, which I really appreciate. Overall, I really love the Liberty Air 2
*I did not buy from Amazon, but I do have the Liberty Air 2.*"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-31,Worked great. no issues and the cost was great,I have a Samsung galaxy S8 active and my wife has a S8 Note. I ordered two pairs of these and both worked great. no issues pairing and its nice being able to use either earbud solo. The case is small and compact. For $100 these are awsome and they stay in my ears very well. I usually have trouble with earbuds falling out of my ears but these don't. I am pleased to say thay these exceded my expectations. Ended up being better than I expected. I would definitely buy again.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-31,Soundcore,Great bugs 🤘🏾
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-31,WOW!!,"They don’t have the feature my Sony’s do, but holy hell do they sound good. Bass is on POINT! I got them because they’re waterproof- where my Sony’s are not, so for biking, running these are my go-to. They stay in the ears really well and are light enough to stay in there well while working out. Super super impressed with the sound"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-01,Worth the Money,Customized equalization app works perfectly.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-01,Awesome!,"True AirPod pro killers. They sound better, have better battery life, and cost less than half. They also have customizable EQ from the app. The only thing missing is transparency mode, which I would honestly never use. Save yourself some money, and get these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-01,Buy these!!,"Wow!! These headphones are amazing. The price is a little high, but I can assure you the quality and sound is spot on. I'd say better overall bass than I was expecting and great clarity even at high volume. They are missing one thing and that is the ability for sound passthrough. If you're going to talk to anyone, you'll have to lower the volume a lot. Otherwise great earbuds"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-01,Great,Phone mic is not as clear as could be... sound is great!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-01,Phone call microphone is cheap and terrible,"Unlike the Apple version, these headphones are *terrible* for phone calls. Friends tell me it sounds like I'm in a deep tunnel, pixelated, and generally terrible sound. Noise cancellation doesn't work - in fact, outside sounds are ""amplified"" instead of cancelled. I'll try to return or re-sell. Anker has great speakers, but too bad they were too cheap on the microphone for these units. :("
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-01,"These are excellent, for a good price.","No way I was going to spend $250 for Apple Earbuds, but I was also fed up with the $20 to $50 Bluetooth neck band earphones, which might last 3 or 4 months before some wire gets bent and shorted out. These are great. I'm very happy with these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-04-01,A value in sound,"These are just a step down from the Liberty 2 Pro's in sound reproduction due to different equalizer programs. The bass is on par but the mids and highs are just a tiny bit less due the drivers used. The earid takes up some of the slack, for the price point these are a great value if you use these for music. The battery life is a lot less compared to the Liberty 2Pro's, but you're comparing Apple's to Orange's."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-01,WORTH EVERY PENNY,AS OF NOW THE ANKER LIBRARY AIR 2s ARE AMAZING AND THE BEST TWEBs I HAVE OWNED. MY SON AND I HAVE PERSONALLY SWITCHED FROM OTHER TWEBs (SAMSUNG) AND ANOTHER PAIR THAT BOUGHT MY SON. I ALSO HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THESE AND THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD TO SAY...... WORTH THE MONEY EVERY PENNY. WOULD BUY AGAIN IN A HEART BEAT.....
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-02,Great sound and ease of use.,"Great device, I use them for remote meetings and working out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-02,Fit is a challenge,Fit is a challenge. I've had others that stay better in place.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-03,Absolutely amazing,"I’m a stickler for sound quality and these delivered. The Hear ID function is amazing, and that’s aside from the fact that you can already customize the EQ in the app for these. Definitely the best sounding earbuds I’ve used. Well worth the $99. 10/10 would recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-03,Poor connection,"These are a step up In the Soundcore line. But it only connects 50% of the time at best. When it works , it was great for the price. But if it is only working 50% of the time I don’t want them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-04,Easy to pair amazing sound,Just unboxed 20 minutes ago. Pairing with iPhone 8+ was super easy. Sound quality is amazing! No regrets.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-04,Phenomenal value.,They sound amazing the case is very small the battery lasts a long time and the features are awesome. It automatically pauses when you pull one earbud out. Amazing product. Spectacular value.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-05,"Sound fantastic, but no volume?","The volume can only be adjusted using their smart-device. So if you pair the earbuds with your your television's Bluetooth audio, itheres no way to adjust the volume... total bummer."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-05,"Not good for calls, in car, or stationary. Great sound quality though.","The earbuds are advertised for their superior call quality. Sitting in a quiet office, everytime I used them with either my Samsung Note 9 or my wife's iPhone 11, I would recieve complaints and have to revert to speaker phone. Horrible call quality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-05,"Outstanding sound quality, great call quality with slight connection issues","Anker is a well-known brand for its quality products. This is another quality product in the list that has fantastic sound and call quality (though calls are a bit low volume for the receiver). Its touch controls are responsive unlike other wireless earbuds and its feature to pause music when removing the earbud makes this product easy to use and appreciative to have. It has a an app which allows for customization of touch controls and EQ which singles out these earbuds from others. About once every two weeks, I experience issues with the connectivity of the earbuds but is fixed by placing them back in the case and taking them out. Slightly annoying but compensated for the rest of the features."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-05,As advertised!!,Perfect
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-05,Difficult to keep paired.,"I have used them now for about a week, the sounds is awesome and the ability to control volume directly from the the buds is awesome, the ap lets you customize the controls and change equalizer settings... with that been said...I have had frustrations with keeping them paired with the various devices I use, once paired the have to be re paired ever time you use the device this has become really annoying.. overall they are a good chose with many good features.."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-06,nice earbuds,sound quality better than air pod pro.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-06,Fantastic!!,Fantastic! Took a minute to figure out how to use them accurately however use them daily
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-06,Nice ear buds but lacking a key component of being able to pair with multiple devices,"I have ordered many items from Anker and have loved them until this most recent product. I was super excited to order the Liberty Air 2 Air Buds. I have had cheap ear buds and more expensive ear buds and I thought by going through ANKER for these air buds, they would have had the technology figured out. The Air buds sound great, the design is nice and they fit well. BUT they will not let you pair them with multiple devices. Even a $25 pair of air bud has the feature for me to have my ear buds paired with my laptop and phone but nope, not these. Super bummed with the lack of technology. Now if i have my ear buds listening to something on my laptop and my phone rings I have to take the ear buds out to answer my phone when my cheap $25 ones would let me easily pick up my phone and answer it. Super Disappointing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-07,So far I love these.,"What can I say? First I don't have many Bluetooth headphones, but I have used a lot of wired earbuds and headphones. These sound every bit as good as the best earbuds I have had and only the highest-end headphones beat it out for sound, and only slightly at that. Second the battery... It seems to work as listed. I get a good 6 hours of heavy use before dropping these things back into the case and take a break for 15 mins. The marketing documents seem to be accurate. THANK YOU SOUNDCORE! The cost"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-07,Amazing,Wanted to give it time before my review as always anker makes another great product if you want great headphones and the ability to talk these are the ones couldn't be happier one thing to make it better is add an air hole that apple uses to help reduce the plugged ear feeling
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-07,Awesome earbuds great price!,"I've been using the Liberty Air 2 earbuds for about 4 months now and am loving them so far! I've had great luck with Anker products in the past and so I figured I'd give these a try as a much cheaper alternative to the Air Pod Pros since I've always preferred the rubber tips as opposed to plastic. Good battery life, clear sound quality for music, and fantastic call quality. The interchangeable tips ensure a snug fit (I use the largest size). They connect promptly to my phone and I've never had an issue with connectivity. I love the black with red trim. When I had an issue, Rochelle from customer service was able to promptly assist me. Overall another big win for the Anker family of products!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-07,great value for the price,great value for the price
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-08,When connected works as expected,"Update: great customer service, although the blue tooth pairing is not as simple as it should be. Soundcore Liberty Air 2 are great except for one flaw. Pairing, they do not automatically pair with the device they are currently paired with, you have to go to devices blue tooth settings and manualy connect them EVERY TIME you want to use them and if you want to connect them to another device you have to manually forget the device in you blue tooth settings and re-pair the earbuds and after doing this 2-3 times they will pair. When they are paired and working they are awesome. It is to bad that every time you want use the ear buds it takes a couple minutes of messing around with them to get them to work."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-08,Almost Perfect,"These buds have great sound quality! With the app, you can truly customize the sound to your liking. I did notice there was still outside noise coming in at a reasonable volume level, but (obviously) if you turn the volume one or two notches above your phone's recommended setting, you can't hear a thing. I, personally don't like that because after I'm done using them I feel that i have trouble hearing for a couple of minutes. As for comfort, these did not suit me very well, but that's because I have a weird ear shape. They felt uncomfortable at times and when working out, they did come out my ear sometimes. They do come with different size ear bud nozzles, but these earbuds are definitely not universal. Overall, they sound great, the price is very fair, and the comfort, in my experience, could be better. I'd still recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-08,Bummer,Lasted 4.5 months. So I guess that’s like paying 75 cents per day. They sounded fine and the battery life was good... while they lasted. I just think $100 should get a product that will work longer. One earbud stopped pairing consistently. That earbud stopped working completely.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-09,Pretty good!,"Sounds great for $100! One thing to note: they don’t have noise cancelling, BUT with them at half volume I can barely hear the gas powered weed trimmer while trimming."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-09,Nice fit,For music
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-09,Not What I Expected,They were decent.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-09,Awesome,"Got these a few days ago, WOW great sound quality, love the equalizer feature and call quality is right up there, tried other non Apple brands and there's no comparison, the extra cost over bultone is well worth it, so glad I bought these, almost sprung for air pods but apples features aren't really set up for Android these soundcore liberty air 2s are perfect for me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-10,Only left side used for talking,I am a truck driver that used blue tooth a lot this headset is very mediocre at best you can only use the left bud for talking the right side is only for music and can’t hold a call by itself which should be in the description why any manufacturer would make or design a set of earbuds that way baffles me I was looking for a pair of buds to replace my AirPods and these aren’t them

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-10,Smart Choice.,"Worth the $$. Super cool looking. Fits greats. Works extremely well. Definitely recommend to anyone who doesnt want to spend $200+ for Apple Airbuds. These are just as good, for HALF the price!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-10,Great value,Great product and great value.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-10,Always a reliable source,"I have never been disappointed by Anker. Chargers, wires, you name it. They deliver what they promise. Ear phones are easy to use, I don't hear that well so I can't rate their tech. but they work great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-11,Best headphones,"Best wireless headphones. Easy to use, great sound quality and I love it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-12,Good product,I love it so far
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-12,Sound quality is great but...,"I have been using Anker Air 2 wireless earbuds for the last few months. Pros:
- Great sound quality.. in my opinion, it sounds better than some of my higher end earbuds. - Reasonable price for the sound quality
- Comfortable to wear them for hours. - Excellent phone call sound quality. The best one among all my earphones. Cons
- After disconnect from a device, 90% of time it does not reconnect automatically. - Left earbud sometimes does not connect to the device when the right one connected."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-13,Overall ok ... quality does not correspond to the price,"Pros: good built quality, ergonomic, good battery life
Cons: noise filtering through the mic is outrageously bad... compared to cheaper cheap buds.... needless to compare to apple... sound quality is okish but not great.... and spend 30 min figuring out how to connect both earbuds...
As a consumer I want a pug and play... and not spend 30min on a research how to reset it"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-13,Battery didn't last 7 hours as advertised,"Today (April 13, 2020) is the first time I got a chance to use this product for a meeting of more than 1 hour and after 2 hours of meeting I suddenly got a notification in my left here that the battery is low. The meeting is scheduled for 3 hours. Towards the end of the meeting I can't hardly hear what the presenter was saying. So this is a bad product to go for a long meeting as I don't get what I was expected (7 hours of time as advertised) and I charged the buds for more than 24 hours before the meeting. Is this a faulty unit that I got?"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-14,Can't hear phone calls,"I purchase this product, primarily to make and receive phone calls. Unfortunately, I could not adjust the volume on the earphones high enough to hear the callers. Even with the volume on my iPhone maxed out, I still could not hear them. I reached out to the company, for assistance, and did not get a response. However, the music sounded great but I needed it for phone calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-14,Poor quality for the price.,"The battery life is no good. I charged all night and used product for work for approximately 4 hrs, kept saying battery low. Not good."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-14,Excellent purchase for this price.,Initially i was bit skeptical for this purchase as i was using AirPods. But after using it for about two weeks no. I am throughly enjoying the sound and special its custom EQ setting. Call quality with 4 mics is quite clear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-15,Outstanding overall performance,Good sound quality and comfortable design!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-15,Only Connects to One Device At A Time,"Did not see anywhere on product info that you can't switch easily from multiple devices. If you'll be only using one device with these, they'll be good. Sound quality is ok - not great. To use with multiple devices, you first need to know which device was last used, go into settings, disconnect, then connect with the other device. just fyi"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-15,Dead less than 2 months,"Initially they worked beautifully and I was very happy with my purchase. The sound was very clear and app was easy to use but for one of them to not even work within two months of reviving them, I don't know if i would buy anything Anker again. I trusted the brand to make a reliable product. Due to corona I been working from home and I have been using them everyday. For the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Wireless Earbuds to stop working in the middle of a meeting, that was unacceptable."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-17,Battery doesn't quite last three hours,"This is a tough review, as I'm very pleased with certain aspects of the product and really disappointed with others. Battery:
The battery life was one of my main motivations in choosing this particular model, as I ordered these for the purpose of teaching my classes over zoom. My class is three hours long, which should be WELL within the range of the battery, even allowing for some exaggeration on the manufacturer's part when assessing battery life. However, around the 2 hour and 40 min mark of each class, I get a low battery warning and the earbuds shut off within five minutes after that, dumping me into computer audio. I teach throughout the day, so I was planning to charge them between classes, but I since I can't even get through a single class without interruption, I'll unfortunately need to return these. Sound:
The sound quality is superb for calls, great for conversation and presenting. The noise isolating feature of the mic appears to work perfectly. However, music is rather unimpressive, with a shallow sound lacking some of the deeper registers. This makes me feel like I need to increase the volume, but increasing it makes the mid and high levels rather piercing. The EQ unfortunately does not seem to address this. Size and quality:
The size and weight of these is just great. They fit my small ear canals well and don't stick out from my head like some models. All the surfaces feel high quality and the charging case has a nice matte finish, quality buttons, and a snappy feeling magnetic lid. Charge:
These charge well and quickly whether plugged in or using the charging case....just don't hold that charge well. Wish I could keep these guys, but probably not worth $100 for the sound quality, and the battery life makes it a non starter for me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-17,Need to connect quicker,These sound amazing. Only wish they would connect to my phone quicker and connect to multiple devices.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-17,Must have,These ear buds are amazing...definitely will recommend
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-18,Great sound needs security features added especially when paying $100+ .,Lost them after 7 days and was very disappointed when I learned they did not have find my buds or remote shut down feature as part of the app I downloaded..
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-18,Not worth it for the price point,"I have been using this for 1 month and I noticed that I was only getting 3.5 hours of playtime from full charge - Right earbud drained faster than Left. I reached out to support and they asked me to perform some test. They asked me to use only the right earbud and make sure the volume is at 50%. I did the test and got 4 hours. They replaced the unit right away. I received the replacement unit and first thing I did was to verify the battery life. I tested the device with typical use case of having 2 earbuds at 50% volume (as recommended by support) but only got 3.5 hours of playtime (again!). I reached back to support and they told me to test again with 1 earbud. I did what was told and got 6.5 hours. I reported my result and was told that getting 6.5 hours is normal and I should not be worried. I told them that I got 6.5 hours with 1 earbud but only getting 3.5 hours with 2 earbuds. I complained since I dont think the declared 7 hours of playtime was meant for single earbud use. Finally, someone else from support told me that they will replace my unit again. I decided to perform some more tests to see if I was probably using it wrong. These were the configurations I did and with the corresponding play time hours:
1) 2 earbuds, 50% volume = 3.5 hours
2) right earbud only, 50% volume = 6.5 hours
3) 2 earbuds, 50% volume, disabled auto pause, and button commands = 3.5 hours
4) 2 earbuds, ~40% volume, disabled auto pause and button commands = 3.5 hours
5) 2 earbuds, used left earbud as master (connected to phone), same as config 4 = 3 hours
Based on these tests, I believe the bud-to-bud bluetooth connection is the root cause of the draining issue. I reached back to support and told them about the results and told them that I rather get a refund than receive another device. I dont want to go through the same process again. I returned my device back and now waiting for my refund. I wish I did some more research before pulling the trigger. I have seen a lot of posts about this battery drain issue."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-18,Really bad earphones,"Really disappointed when I tried these on. I keep hearing static noises when I turn these on. There are also times where the music echoes and its really frustrating. Hopefully I can exchange for another pair and write a better review next time. *UPDATE*
Customer service reached out to me regarding the defective item. They were kind to send me another pair. I feel so much better after receiving the new earbuds! They are working fine and my problem was resolved. The earbuds are are so great! Thank you for the Customer Service Team for reaching out and making this process easy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,0,2020-04-18,Garbage,The battery is junk. Does not last. Customer service is a joke.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-18,SIMPLY AMAZING!,"These are AMAZING! I can wear them all day and they don’t hurt my ears. I’m on the phone a lot and the calls are clear and I come through clear as well. I 10/10 would recommend. If I had to look for something to be better it would be the ease of connectivity. Sometimes it takes a while to get both connected to a new device but once you do it is seamless to connect from that point on. I had one mishap on my end...I was on a call and just had one headphone in, which will work if you click the correct headphone you want your phone to connect to. For example, every time I call and I have my headphones connected, my iPhone will ask if I want to call using the phone speaker, the phone, the headphones (Soundcore 2 or Soundcore 2-L), or my computer. You have to make sure, if you’re using one headphone, to click on the correct one that you’re using—which I forgot to double check and it sounded like I was speaking down a long hallway because I had it connected to the one out of my ear and on the desk. So I’ve since gone to both in the ear while making calls and it is great. The look and feel is amazing. So glad I bought these!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-19,Good buy for the price,Having difficulty finding right ear gel fit. Ear buds falling out of ear just walking around.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-19,Better than airpods!,Great product at a great price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-19,They work great except for the touch controls,No issues with breaking up and either connect quickly. Battery life has been everything that was advertised. The reason I rate them 4 starts is because I would prefer actual buttons to the touch controls because it sometimes starts playing when I put one in my pocket with another piece of metal or the other earbud.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-20,Clear sound,Clear sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-21,Customer service rocks!!!!,Was very happy at first. But after using ear Buds only a few times now they are not working properly. But!!!! Customer service was extremely helpful and polite. They took care of the issues i had with non working set. Seller/customer service is on point! New set is working flawlessly. Extremely happy with product.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-21,Both of them work at the same time but it said it do,Disappointed
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-22,Anker Support,"Anker support top notch. Had an issue with my ear pods. Went through all the steps online with anker to trouble shoot. Couldn’t fix the Issue. So they sent me a new pair. The troubleshooting process is painless, they explain it very well."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-22,"Some great features, but lacking in bass and sharing","CONS:
Awful for sharing. My wife and I thought we could share the pair and quickly realized the headache required. You must manually disconnect from one device to them connect to another. I have an iPhone 8 Plus and my wife has a OnePlus 6T. Also, the bass seemed non existent when compared to the wired Apple EarPods. PROS:
The voice quality and comfort were actually pretty good. Same with the battery life. Was great that you could use each ear piece individually and the music paused when pulling out earpiece. Passive noise canceling worked pretty well. Automatically connected to last paired device. Great if you only have one device. Hassle if you have more than one device or plan on sharing with someone else. I was really hoping these would be a sufficient replacement for my original AirPods that stopped working. These are much cheaper and so obviously wouldn’t have all the same features, but after reading great reviews I thought we might have a winner on our hands. Unfortunately we will need to be looking elsewhere."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-22,Superior Performance for the Price,Very pleased with ear buds. Easy to set up and great battery life.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-22,tap to connect functions,"This product isn't to bad. The tap functions are a bit off. When you want to tap the earbud to answer a call, you have to keep tapping it and finally it picks up the call. I don't like that it shuts off if your blue tooth on your phone is turned off after a few minutes and you've go to put it back into the case and pull it back out to turn the earbud on. It has a special cable to charge the case with. Yes, that means you have to keep up with one more special charging cable added to your collection of cable for all you other goodies that need to be charged. When you tap your ear to answer, it's not very comfortable on the ear drum as the ear piece seals pretty well. Sound quality is pretty darn good though. They took pride in their product box. It's a pretty good product but they have some fine tuning to do with the touch to control functions. The touch response isn't very accurate."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-24,Sound quality,Sound quality top notch. Different size ear tips make it fit very well in my ear. Only draw back was not being able to control volume on the earbuds themselves. have to use the phone. But that for me is not a big draw back.Just some people may not like that.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-24,Yeah,👍
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-24,Best deal for 100$,"Perfect fit,love the bass,definitely a must buy"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-04-24,Great product,"These Bluetooth ear buds are the best, Great quality...These are a Fathers Day present..Im sure they will be a favorite...!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-24,Need known,"Ok,the box be protected good but the touch not doing much good"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-24,"Excellent Sound for the $, but they hurt my ears","I've only had these for a few days, and I want to like them more, but I can't have the earbuds in for more than 20 minutes before they become extremely uncomfortable. I have tried every size of cover provided and none of them are comfortable for my ears. I have had wireless earbuds for a long time and never had these issues before. This may not be true for everyone but I am super upset about it as I really did my research before purchasing. I am now looking to purchase some wireless over the ear headphones as I need them for work meetings. - The sound quality is excellent for the price and the Soundcore app is quite nice."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-25,Great TWS for under $100($99 new),"These hit all the bars for me. PROS.....
1. Build quality ✅
2. Sound quality ✅
3. Functionality ✅
4. Battery charging/battery life-Buds &Case✅
5. Comfortable wearing for extended periods ✅
6. Everything else ✅
Buy these and you won't be disappointed! I've tried......Soundcore Liberty Pro, ENAC FIRE Future, JBuds Air Executive and the Samsung Galaxy Buds AND THEY ALL FAIL in comparison to the Soundcore Liberty Air 2.
CONS/nit picking; hoping they make a 3 with ""even"" longer battery life and full functionality with touch control."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-25,Go for it,No true issue but the bass response a little lacking. Had to play around with customizing
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-26,"Don't stay connected, weak volume.","Very disappointed in these ear buds. The setup was very easy. They are comfortable, but I haven't worn them for very long periods of time because they don't stay connected consistently. During initial setup, they stayed connected while I was on the couch. However, the next day when I was walking and cleaning my car they kept breaking up and then disconnecting. I have zero problems like this with any of my other Bluetooth speakers and my phone. Also, they have poor volume. Even with them completely maxed out, they aren't very loud and it's harder to hear if you're outside or in noisier environments. Once again, I have zero problems with any other Bluetooth speakers, just these ear buds. I'm returning them tomorrow because they aren't worth $20, much less $100. I would DEFINITELY not buy these again."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-04-26,The recipient liked it,It was a gift.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-27,Awesome earbuds,"Great sound, comfortable and easy to use."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-27,Microphones are maybe too good?,"I had to returns these. The sound quality was fine, but not exceptional. But most importantly, I could not use them for my office phone calls. The microphones point directly down towards your mouth, and therefore, also directly at my keyboard. People on my Zoom meetings complained that the keyboard was drowning out others on the call and sometimes my own voice. My keyboard is not loud, nor am I a harder than normal typist."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-04-27,Will not stay in my ears,these sound really good with satisfying bass but as i wear them they just literally fall out of my ears and will if i dont catch them in time fall to the ground . This all happens with me sitting completely still . Ive tried all eartips too . My Buds+Plus dont sound as good as the LA2 but They Never Fall Out No Matter What I Do .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-27,Great product.,"Once I downloaded there app and took the heating test thre audio quality was unlike any I've ever experienced. I would not use them for running or biking, as I do listen ti music during these activities, because frankly, I'm a little scared if just hous noice cancelling they really are."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,0,2019-10-23,Picture is white but got black pair.,"Update! : BIG ISSUE! Seems like it wants to act on calls now. It seems like it likes to fade in and out of volume of the right earbud but only on calls. This is not a feature, it's a glitch! UPDATE AGAIN! Keeps going mute on calls after 2 mins everytime. Also if you plan on using this with only your right ear, there is almost a 2 sec delay. Basically if you want to use this, it's for music only. The picture shows a white set but I received a black pair. I had to double check that I got the right order. I would normally deduct a star for that but I prefer the black. As far as the headphones themself. I love em! First impression of the packaging was impressive. Simple to open and the instructions were clear. Lots of different adapters for your size of ears. My pair came fully charged. A definite plus for USB-C charging port. Battery lasted a full day of about 8 hours. This is without ever charging em out the box! Controls are simple. The earbuds are touch control. Press 2x to pause/play or answer a call. Earbuds aren't heavy, they also don't feel like they are gonna fall off. In fact I ran with these on and they never even moved position. I purposely shook my head aggressively like a rabid dog and they stayed put. Sound quality is good aswell. This is the hardest part of the review, because unless you hear em you can't tell. At full volume it doesn't distort. Bass is DEEP! You can download the app and adjust the eq, but to be honest I like how they sound from the box. Phone quality is great! This is what I look forward most. At no time did the other side complain of poor quality. This is a definite buy from me!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-10-23,"Call quality varies, Good sound, good ergonomics, great features!","Final update: Anker's newer firmware improved a lot of the quirks I was seeing. Pairing is really good and range seems excellent. The Siri functionality is much improved, and the disorienting synch issue when changing volume is lessened for me. Unfortunately, while the call quality improved, it's still just not very good in most real-world conditions. Anker offered to send a replacement as I may have had a faulty pair. Ultimately I've decided to return these that just barely missed the mark for me. Update 2: Anker’s excellent service department has reached out and is working with me. I’m testing new firmware. I’ll report back. Hopefully these will be great! Update: wish I’d stuck with the old ones now. Totally useless for calls unless I’m indoors in a quiet room. Adjusting volume effects left first then right creating a disorienting effect. Loose pairing every few days and won’t connect. Ugh. These are really good! I had previously sworn off Anker/Soundcore earbuds after a poor experience with their first generation Liberty Lite and Plus models, but I'm glad I gave these a shot. I first bought the Liberty Air (first model) and I liked them, but saw these were available just two days later. I took back my Airs and bought these at a local store, and I'm sure glad I did. The extra $30 is well worth it! + Sound is quite good for true wireless buds in this price range. Because they are in-ears, they sound worlds better than the AirPods while blocking out a lot of outside noise, but not so much that it's dangerous for walking if music is kept to a reasonable level. These have a lot more present bass than the first Airs but it's not overwhelming at all. A really clear upgrade over the previous model. + The app is indispensable. Setting a personalized EQ on these made a huge difference, and they already sounded good. But the bit of brashness that I heard initially faded with the use of the EQ. Also, the controls (which are sensitive!) can be customized in the app. It took a couple of tries to connect for me, but it's a once-in-a-while necessity, not an every-day thing. + They fit my ears SO WELL! I'm a hard fit when it comes to earbuds which is why I have stuck to an old pair of tiny wired earbuds for a while. I tried and took back several pairs of ""snail-style"" in-ears, including the Jabra 65t because they just were not comfortable. With the FIVE sizes of tips included with these, I had no problems getting a comfortable, effective seal. They are really stable too, with none of the cable or ""crunching"" noises some in-ears can get because of flexing of the tips. The tips are a lot easier to get on and off, and overall more comfortable than the original Airs. + The charging case supports USB C AND WIRELESS! I tried a couple of wireless chargers and, while you do need to be careful about placement with the fairly small case, it works well. The case also sports a pairing/reset button. The case is nearly identical in size to the original Airs but the orientation of the buds is different this time. They also click in a bit more satisfyingly. It comes with a high quality 3' USB A-C cable. I'd have preferred a very short 2-4"" cable instead, but it's a good Anker-branded cable. - The peach/pink color of the original Airs doesn't seem to be available in the 2s (yet?) - I actually preferred the flatter design of the original Airs
- No volume control unless you assign it over other necessary controls. the very-long-hold control from the Airs has been dropped you get ""double tap"" and ""tap and hold"" on each bud. - Proximity sensor in the buds seem to pause music when removed from ear, but does not restart it automatically. No way to disable this in the app it seems. I'm really glad Anker/Soundcore has come so far with their wireless buds. While I look a little like a tool wearing these, i think that this format really is superior to most others for fit in my ears. Very happy with these!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-24,AWESOME!,"After a couple pairs of high end top brands, I'm so pleased to find these guys. I got a couple pairs of Samsung ones, but nobody could hear me when I got a call (both new pairs), I choose a Beast Pro and same thing. But these guys are really awesome! Very comfortable,. Easy to use. Very fast bluetooth pairing. Super clear call! Now everybody can hear me even when I'm driving a noisy truck. The battery lasts whole day (extreme use). The case is wireless charging which is so nice. The personalized sound gives a great experience..
1000% recommended!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-10-25,Nice sound and great fit!,"Really enjoying these wireless earbuds and they are my first device pair ever, they connected right away to my S9 and sound great! I recommend downloading the Soundcore app and trying different EQ settings to your taste, there are plenty to choose from. Battery life is really good as well. The price is a little on the premium side, with that said they are extremely nice build quality. The wireless charging on the case is a neat feature."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-26,Wow,"I've played with so many Bluetooth earbuds and headphones, and found that they had weak lows, that I was beginning to feel like a snob. I'm glad these came around. The lows on these are superb. They are full, roomy, and they boom. They really bring the music to life. The highs are also great. The only thing that I'd say is not fantastic are the mids. They're pretty damn good, I just wish they were a little bit more full. They connect easily and right away, without having to dig into the phone settings to correct some problem. Overall these are the best Bluetooth earbuds that I've ever used. Highly recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-26,Save around $60,"Testing these as part of the Amazon Vine program. Can't really find anything to complain about with these ear pods. Fast pairing, good battery life, great sound for both calls and music, and you can answer from either pod, or while just wearing one. Personalized EQ settings via the app is also nice. Quick charging with top up feature, and able to use wireless charging which is a plus. Considering I spent a further $60 on the you know who brand for my kids for Christmas, I personally think these are at least as good, if not better in comfort and styling. I find no reason not to give 5 stars."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-27,My favorite earbuds !!!,"Great set of ear buds similar design to apple pods, so if you like those you will like these. Case is nice and small and the ear buds fit comfortably. Battery life is good no problem there. Now for the sound quality. The ear buds sound great and get loud I don't listen to them full volume 3/4 volume is loud enough. These earbuds also have very good sound quality out of the box very balanced not too much bass but doesn't lack it either. If you dont like the way they sound soundcore has an app for these earbuds that allows you to adjust the eq to exactly how you want them to sound. Oh and by the way I'm listening to them as I write this review. One other huge thing I like is when you remove these from your ear they pause what you were listening to. This is the only earbud that I know of that does this. Why is this awesome well if you are listening to a podcast and you need to remove the earbud to talk to someone you wont miss a thing cause it automatically pauses!!!! Then just double tap the right ear to play !!! The earbuds are touch sensitive no physical buttons but they respond well. I love these no complaints or dislikes soundcore really raised the bar with these !!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-10-28,Good but they take some getting use to,"The sound quality of these headphones is great. I was really, really, impressed by that. However, they take some getting use to as far as how to operate or at least they did for me. I would suggest reading the user manual a few times. One of them-the left-kept popping out of my ear but I eventually figured out how to keep it in. Over all, these are nice."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-10-28,Easy Setup and Easy Connection!,"I was rather skeptical about these buds when I first saw them. Mainly because I know that Soundcore is a label under Anker and they mainly make battery banks, so how good could these earbuds be? Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised when I hooked them up to my phone and put them in my ears. First, the ease of connecting the headphones. It was as simple as pulling both earbuds out and pressing connect on my Google Pixel 3XL. Once I put the earbuds in the charging case, they disengage from the phone and turn off. When your ready to use them, just take them out of the case and it automatically connects to your phone, assuming you keep you Bluetooth on."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-10-29,Very good but not great sound reproduction. Excellent performance during phone calls,"This is a high quality bluetooth earphone which would be perfect if it only had a slightly better sound reproduction. It comes very close to the performance of my Apple Airpods, and indeed, its connectivity is slightly better. But the Airpods have better base capability and a better sound stage. The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds do have a separate app that you can download and it includes equalization which significantly improves the quality of the sound. It works slightly better than the music equalization provided by the iphone music app.
If you wish to answer your phone with these earbuds you will be pleasantly surprised at how well they work. They work better than any other earbud I have tried, and I have tried four prior to his one. The people with whom you are talking will think you are using your phone in a quiet location so good is the noise reduction. Even in brisk winds, these earbuds work well during phone calls. These earbuds have an excellent battery life and provide all the necessary charging options. When listening to audiobooks, these provide excellent clarity. I love all the characteristics of these earbuds with the exception of the music reproduction. It is, however, better than all the other earbuds I have used except for the Apple Airpods."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-30,Great FIT,"The Liberty Air 2 are stellar earbuds, plus I can wear them for hours at a time and have no discomfort. They have nice noise canceling quality. They have great call quality. I am extremely impressed, by the battery life. They have stayed put in my ears through working out (rowing), doing house work, and even playing with my dog. For those who’s ears hurt wearing earbuds, I suggest trying these as I am thrilled to find ones that are great to use."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-11-01,Great Airbus alternative,"Earbud sound quality is amazing, much better quality than its predecessor. Touch controls are a bit iffy, sometimes they work mostly they don't. Comfort-wise, super comfortable much more than the Apple airpods. Overall really great earbuds"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-11-02,Good Value,This is the updated Soundcore Liberty 2. I had the first version but my son took that pair and I didn’t have the heart to take them back from him so a got a cheap pair. These have been great upgrade for the past few weeks. I can use just one of the ear buds (Left or right) at a time. I do this when outside running so I can hear traffic and people coming up on me as I am slow. The ear buds do a good job dealing with me running a workout HIIT timer while also using Spotify. There are intervals that lower the music level for the interval beeps. My cheap pair of ear buds forgets to raise the volume back up but the Liberty 2’s always remember to raise the volume back up. The sound is good and the buds charge when in the case without having to fidget with the connection. The touch features work. These are a good value. I am using the smallest silicone ear thingies and I am not sure if I have particularly tiny ear canals. When pairing it is listed as Soundcore Liberty Air 2 and that makes it easy to find.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-02,apple isn't the only source for great wireless earbuds,"I didn't like that I received a black set rather than white, but I won't take stars off for that. The packaging is nice, as nice or better than a new set of Bose or other high quality audio product. The earbuds arrived fully charged and the case had a charge to it as well so I could test to see if that worked. Note that the case charges with USB-C, not the micro USB. If you have a late model Mac you already have this. The earbuds did ship with a short cable that can plug in to a standard USB power source, but there's no plug. Most people will have this so its not a big deal. I had an issue with fit but the packaging had a spare set of small and large swap-able ear bud thingies. So I was able to sort that out straight away. Pairing to my iPhone was simple and fast. I made a call right away. The audio quality was a 3/5 on my end. The person I called said the same. We hung up and then she called me back and I wasn't sure how to answer the call without using my phone to answer, then selecting the earbuds before we could actually talk. Well I've learned how to do that. Two taps to the right ear bud. Two taps to disconnect. Two taps to pause music. Two taps to start it up again. Music - it was decent. Then I tried the app which let me set the EQ for the type of music I was listening to. Honestly I'm impressed when I use these in a room with little to no ambient noise. They aren't loud enough for the plane but for other use they sound really great for music. The EQ for spoken word worked well for audiobooks in low ambient noise settings too. Issues - The right ear cuts out from time to time. It just goes dead silent. If I pause the music and play it again it sometimes comes back online with the left. Other times I've disconnected and re-paired with my device. Another issue is when I put the earbuds into the charging case it isn't clear to me that they are charging once I close the case. Bottom line - calls were 3/5, music is 4/5. Great choice for the price, but this is new technology and I think they are still working out some kinks."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-02,Great quality and value,"Was going to buy AirPods but my daughter had a pair of these and loved them. They’re great! Stay in my ears without slipping at all, even on my run. Sound amazing with good noise reduction (I don’t like canceling anyway). Very happy with these!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-11-03,Decent for $,"Good for the price. The design seals off the ear, so while talking with them you hear yourself talking and it throws me off. I wouldn’t purchase for working out or if you plan on using them to talk on the phone a lot."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-03,Great pair of wireless earbuds for the price!!,"I usually don't write reviews, but this pair of earbuds deserves one. First testings did not go so great, until I realized that I had to find the right tip that fit me. Thankfully Anker provides many different options for you in the box, and you can customize each side accordingly. With the fit done, and the equalizer test through Anker's own Soundcore App, I felt a tremendous difference from my first initial sound tests. The sound quality is good enough to hear highs and lows, with enough bass to provide the oomph that you need. Nothing more, nothing less. The touch controls can be changed through the Soundcore App, and you can customize what a double tap and what a long hold does. I would like to see more functionality in the future, but who knows if that could be added. Overall I am very impressed with these headphones. At the price they are at, they can even compete with Airpods. The case even includes wireless charging, something that only the 199$ version of the Airpods include."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-11-03,Very portable and great value for your money!,Great alternative to the airpods BUT at 1/3 of its price. The built quality and finish is impressive at this price. Microphone noise isolation is quite good. I had no complaints while making IP calls in noisy environments.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-11-04,Can take a thrashing!,"It doesn't get much easier than this to enjoy music with no cords or wires. So nice to not have a cord to contend with!! Set up was easy and sound quality is great. Paired easily via bluetooth with iphone 7plus. So far, these have been very comfortable to wear and stay in my ears while I'm working. I ordered specifically because of the diamond coating. I work in an environment that has dust and particles flying around all the time and wanted something slightly more durable. Can take them out and put in pocket too without worries that they'll get tangled and thrashed. Well done, Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-04,I love these!!!,What can I say but WOW! The sound is great and works well with any genre of music you listen to. The battery life really makes these worth it if you're a commuter. Not only that the mic quality of these is right on the heels of the performance of airpods. Great value for my dollar for sure.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-04,"Decent sound, slips a bit while running","I have a few pairs wireless Bluetooth headphones like AELEC S350, RHA MA650, and TaoTronics. That are all under $100. They all are headsets, not actually ear buds that are separate so this is my first pair. At first I thought they would be too big, I have small lobes and most ear plugs don’t fit that great. I was actually surprised the didn’t feel heavy and they seem to stay in place while walking and working out. They kept slipping when I was doing high impact exercises or running. The sound quality is nice, and really liked the stylist, clean white look."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-05,Quality audio,You will receive a bunch of different size ear buds to choose the perfect size for your ear drums. As soon as you put them in your ears all outside noise is canceled out which is really cool. Sound quality is A1! Its simple and fast to charge and comes with an energy bank for on the go.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2019-11-05,Some good. Some not good,"There are some things I really like about these headphones. First, they are very portable. The case is small and convenient and acts as the charger. Also the case is rechargeable on my wireless charger. The sound quality is good for this price point. The fit is very good and sound isolating. Finally, they are lightweight and almost disappear when you are wearing them they are so comfortable. Why three stars? First, call quality is terrible for those on the receiving end. During the same conversations, my voice went from clear to garbled and back frequently without changing position or environment. Second, the touch control is ineffective for changing volume. While the touch on each earpiece can be customized, I could never get the volume change to work with any consistency. Also, for being so small and cordless, they have an amazing amount of motion related noise from just walking around with them on. It is like shaking the cord on corded headphones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-11-08,First set of Buds,"My first pair of buds, nothing to compare them too . I like the fit and the sound, battier life is still in testing. Feels like good build quality. I always used Anker products in the passed. Fingers crossed"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-11-12,"Excellent sound and great features similar to another popular brand ear pod, only at a lower price.","These are my first pair of Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds. My husband owns another model of Soundcore earbuds and he loves them. These are even better in that they are in a wireless rechargeable case and they have the same popular stem design as the Apple wireless ear pods. They are available in white or black. Personally I like the white as I think they are easier to find if you drop one and the small white case is easy to find buried in my purse. The sound quality is superb. No one knows I am on a wireless earphone. The battery life is excellent. They recharge for 2 hours of playtime in 10 minutes, they can last over 7 hours without a charge and the case can recharge them for almost 28 hours of use before the case needs recharging. They are relative simple to use, tho because I am new to wireless earphones I have a small learning curve to master, I keep hanging up on people because I touch or tap the ear phone. I am still getting use to the buds and trying to remember what you tap for music is not the same tap for phone use. I have to experiment with the multiple ear cushions that were included to find my perfect fit. I think one of my ears is bigger than the other:0 I did find that when I have both earbuds in and I am on a call I tend to scream because I can't hear myself, thats how well they block sound. I removed one ear bud and this solved the problem. Wearing one ear bud does not affect the sound quality to the person on the call nor does it affect my hearing on a call. The Soundcore app is a must and you can customize the sound and touch techniques to your personal preferences. I didn't realize you actually pair both, not one, ear bud with your phone. These earbud stems come with a handy wireless charging case, extra foam attachments for your earbud ends, a direction sheet and a charging cable that has a velcro wrap attached to it. On the Amazon listing you can watch videos on how to use the ear buds. Let me tell you, those videos were very helpful. The Soundcore wireless buds were easy to pair to my iphone 8 plus. These really are a great deal, for the sound quality, accessories, and the wireless rechargeable case. We have owned several Anker products before from charging cables to battery packs, their quality is top of the line."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-11-13,Airpod Killers,"I own 3 different pairs of wireless earbuds, and these are by far my favorite. I also own a pair of AirPods and this products predecessor, the original Liberty Air earbuds. Sound quality on these is the best of the three by far. Both iterations of the Liberty Air Earbuds blow AirPods out of the water for sound quality. The charging case for the Liberty Air 2's is about 10% smaller than the old model, bringing it to about the same size as the AirPods. The battery life on these is just as advertised, but I don't really listen at a very loud volume. These also have much better support on Android devices - you'll be able to monitor the battery level as long as you have a more recent version of Bluetooth on your phone. Best part? The price on these is phenomenal! Why spend over $100 when you can get these, and they sound better? These are my go-to headphones. I love this product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-13,Nice Earphones of a Great Color,"I do like these earphones. There is a little background noise which is pretty common with these wireless earphones, and as with all such wireless earphones, I have an exceptionally difficult time finding earpieces that fit my evidently extraordinary ears comfortably. Still, there are definitely the way to go if you are a reasonably active person or one who likes to listen to a book while others around you watch TV or listen to music other than yours. I find them worth the money and like the fact that they are discreetly colored and not a glaring WHITE like name-brand earphones. I also like the fact that you can wear them with a knitted winter cap without getting into a hopeless tangle with wires and so forth. I am inclined to just wear one in most situations though so that I can be aware of ambient noise. Now, if only my cell phone was as convenient!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2019-11-19,Very nice sound but a real nuisance,"My first impression of this product was so negative that I put it on the shelf for several weeks before trying again. Like many products today, the documentation deserves 0 stars. The Quick Start Guide is truly tiny (See the photo of the guide next to an earbud. ), and it is all in pictures. I realize they are trying to satisfy an international market, but by trying to satisfy everyone simply, they risk satisfying no one. As shown in the photo, to hang up a call the diagram says: 2” . I had no idea what that meant. I consulted 5 adults of differing generations, and only one correctly interpreted the “ sign to mean seconds, i.e., press for 2 seconds. Admittedly there was a clock in the diagram that people noticed, but they still did not associate the mark with seconds. I tried to access the full User Guide, which is not provided in hard copy, but it is so ridiculously small on my phone that some of it could not be read even with a magnifying glass. When I tried to access it on my laptop, Norton Security blocked it, calling it a “known dangerous web page with six computer threats”. I had to write to the company to get a copy, which they sent in PDF. This manual was much clearer, and if you get the earbuds I highly recommend the manual. The earbuds charge in a small charging case, and it is a bit of a geometric puzzle to figure out how to insert them into it, which the pictures referred to above did not clarify. Once I figured it out, the charging worked fine. However, when you recharge the carrying case, the charging cord is a type C; I could not use my workhorse micro USB cord that keeps my phone, kindle, etc., full of juice. Another thing to carry around or misplace, although it may be the next standard. It is also very tricky to take the earbuds out of the charging case without turning them on, which I might not necessarily want to do. And even when I have turned them off, if I put them in the charging case to charge them, they light up and seem to turn themselves on automatically and try to pair if my phone is nearby. I also found the controls on the earbuds hard to use. Supposedly 2 simple taps answers the phone, for example, but that often did not work. Since my primary use is to listen to music or books it does not matter if I have to tap more than 2 times to get it to recognize my command, but it would be nice for occasional use to answer the phone, if I could rely on it answering the phone before the caller gives up. Once you get over the introduction to using them, these earbuds deliver an excellent sound quality, but you will have to decide for yourself if they are worth the trouble."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-04-27,Pleased With My Purchase,"The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 is an excellent buy, especially for the price. The sound is crisp, good bass that is not overwhelming and connection is easy and simple. I am very pleased with my purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-25,Solid but not what I needed,"Was looking for a really good noise cancelling microphone for work calls in a loud area due to an air-conditioner. My existing Jabra 65T performed far better. Outside of that I would recommend these, great sound and decent microphone"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-22,I only use these for the phone and I only use one at a time. I barely get 2 hrs from each. Junk.,"The left died after one month. Do not buy. Now, i am quarantined out of the country and can not returned. As much as I hate Apple, I should have gotten another pair of those. Again, do not buy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-20,Terrible for phone calls.,"These have great sound quality for music but terrible for phone calls. I bought these a few months ago and had to return them because of issues during phone calls. I bought them again this time hoping firmware updates would fix the issues. These are terrible for phone calls, period. Anker needs to step it up and fix known issues with these earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-16,Not worth it .,Both EarPods stopped charging and tend to have connectivity issues . They seem nice and sleek but I’m down $100 and back to wired headphones : /
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-12,Good for the price,There was a problem with connectivity of the first pair. The pair that was sent as a replacement doesn't have such issue. The sound good especially with custom equalizer.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-07,Wind noise and oscillating sound,People hear a constant wind noise when talking to me. It's clear on my end but they say it sounds like I'm driving in a car. The noise between the head buds oscillates from one ear to the other.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-28,The best budget earbuds,I bought this one because it has the best micro on the market so far
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-26,Amazing customer service!,It worked great for a month. Then the right side won't link up.... I was unclear on how to Reset it and wrote my review and Ancker wrote me back offering to replace it which was delivered within a week! Their customer service is amazing! They gave me a return label in the box with the replacement and was super stoked!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-26,Good true wireless headset for the price,"Good true wireless headset for the price. Easy connect and app support provides necessary added features to improve sounds quality. Sound is decent and I would give this 3.5 stars overall. Sounds is “bright”. Call clarity is great and I’ve had no issues while on calls. Pros: Price, call clarity, app support with equalizer, touch functionality, battery life, ease of use. Cons: sound is bright and could use more bass, after calls music becomes distorted and you have to reconnect, touch functions lag somewhat."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-23,Not hearing perfectly any more? These earbuds compensate.,"They’re great Bluetooth headphones but even better is you want audio-correction. The accompanying app will test your hearing and then program the headset to compensate for frequency and hearing loss. I’m 60, my hearing has deteriorated a little, and yet these earbuds reverse the decay. Quite impressive."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-22,Excellent Customer Service,"After my initial pair of earbuds was experiencing BT connectivity problems, I posted a review explaining the issue. A customer service rep reached out and offered to replace my defective product at no charge! The new pair of earbuds works perfectly (so far), and I am very happy with the sound quality and battery life. This is the kind of customer service that will bring me back to Anker in the future."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-22,Pretty good so far.,Incredibly. Truly. It was a bit difficult getting it setup. Nothing major. Just pairing troubleshooting. Mostly me! Anywho. Still need to conference call on it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-21,A Major Go... Buy These,"My third pair of true wireless earbuds... third time is a charm. These are much better than the other two brands I’ve used. The fit in the ear is perfect and the sound is tremendous. Crystal clear vocals and fabulous bass. I’m hearing sounds in songs that I didn’t hear before. I love the Soundcore app and the Hear ID feature that customized the sound to my ears. Don’t hesitate... buy these. Like my buddy Flossy Carter says, “A major go.”"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-20,"Great for music, okay for calls","These took me a while to get used to. I was debating between Airpods 2, which my wife has...and these. The reviews speak for themselves for both products. However, I wanted these mainly for sound quality. I am a bass head. These earbuds are not ideal for someone who wants over-amplified bass. The reason: because these sound amazing! These are the hands down the best earbuds/headphones to listen to music. The quality across the sound spectrum is great. Songs with no bass...great. Rock songs with lots of drum kicks...clear and separate from highs. Songs with lots of bass...hits on all frequencies. The biggest thing is getting them in your ears properly. Took me some time to figure out which sized tips to use. As for call quality...its great. Picks up anything really, which can be problematic mostly if you're outside and it's breezy. But the thing I really don't like about these is that I CAN NOT enjoy them if I am eating, or singing along..or really anything that involves my jaw moving. It moves the earbuds to a place where I can no longer catch the lows. And on calls it's super annoying because I feel like they're going to fall out. So, take this for what it's worth. Music quality: AMAZING! (though I'm not a fan of their app). Call quality: Great! Just be aware that they move out of place when you move you mouth at all."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-19,Great ear phones,"I got these for Christmas for my wife. The left one didn’t work. Emailed there customer support, they sent me tips to try to get it to work. It turned out I got a bad pair. They worked with me a had me a new pair of ear phones in 3 days. There customer service rep Hayley was awesome very help full. The new set of ear phones work perfectly and battery life is good and sound quality and noise canceling are awesome. I recommend these to any my friends."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-19,Excellent for Hands-free Calling,"These are amazing, exceeded my expectations. I use them for phone calls only both in my office and in the car. They filter environmental noise very well for the caller on the receiving end. I have a little trouble with bluetooth connection now and again when an ear bud turns off. The battery life is great, one charge lasts me a week with frequent use during the day on calls. No issues with sound or maintaining bluetooth connection while on a call. Noise cancelling on my end is ok, I usually use only one ear bud however so not a priority for me generally. Given these exceeded my expectations I'm happy I tried them given the cheaper price over Galaxy Plus buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-19,Very nice,It’s pretty good for what it does. The gestures are nice to customize on the app. Pretty neat and last a good while
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-17,Soundcore,These have a great sound for the price. Plus the coustom equalizer to my own hearing are great. Highly recommended.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-11,"Great Customer Service Experience, Great Headphones","After the good review on CNET I went and purchased a pair; my first earbuds. I had a technical problem with the first pair and reached out to Anker customer service. After I returned the original pair, and dealt with some lovely USPS challenges, I eventually received a new pair of the headphones thanks to Anker's customer service team. Still getting used to the feel of earbuds, but the sound is exceptional, especially when listening to High Def audio. It's got great range and clarity for a variety of music I listen to. Would recommend these if not for the audio alone (and the price) but also a reliable customer service experience."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-10,Liberty Air 2s are 🔥🔥🔥,"Another great set of headphones from Anker! These headphones are really good. The app makes them even more usable so you can adjust the equalizer and customize your touch controls. There is even a setting that automatically pauses the sound when you remove an ear bud and that has been very convenient for when people interrupt my jam session lol. I've tried the over the ear Bang and Olfsen, Bose, and Sony and they are more comfortable in a long term use situation but you're also wearing something on your head. I really like the bass and clear sound quality that the Liberty Air 2s have and that's why I think they stand up to the over the ear headphones that I mentioned above for 1/3 or more of the price. Don't pay for a name, pay for quality and great customer service! That's the one of the best things about Anker, excellent customer service! If for some reason you have an issue with their product they will address your concerns professionally and promptly."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-03-07,"Nice air buds , hard composite bothers my sensitive ears","Here’s my personal take on Soundcore Liberty Air 2
The sound quality is good and the voice calling is good. The sound quality suffers a bit or I should say that the ear piece microphone picks up everything in the background when you are in a noisy environment as was relayed to me the person on the end of the conversation. My only issue was the actual earphone pressing against my ears when trying to operate them by pressing the points on the earpieces it feels like I’m pressing them farther into my ear canal and it feels uncomfortable to me, now it may be that my ears are just to sensitive and the pressure is just a bit much for me. With that being said I think that the Air 2 are a good pair of air buds. I’m just looking for something made with a softer material if that’s even possible."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-05,Not for phone calls,"These things have wonderful sound quality for music and videos... if that's what you're looking for, you can stop reading here. I'm not a fan of the fit, there are several size earbuds but they will not stay securely in your ears, they are comfortable but it doesn't take much for them to just come out... wings would be a great idea. Call quality is what I'm truly looking for. I've done the customized hearing test to maximize your listening experience. This works great for music and videos but does not carry over to call quality. Folks tell me they can hear all kinds of background noise so, noise cancelling isn't there. Folks can hear and understand me just fine. Call quality is like going from stereo to an AM radio.. hollow, tinny, not rich. I am so very disappointed. If you want buds to listen to music then you should be very happy with these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-01,Best on the market for the price.,Very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is excellent. Amazing mids and highs. Bass is better than air pods at half the price! Customizable EQ to set sound to your preferences. Connects easily and never loses connecion to my phone. No lag during videos. Highly highly recommended!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-01,Good sound,"More comfortable than the pros
Good sound
Happy"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-26,Do more Research on your product,"Sound very good when listening to music or a video. Horrible when using on a phone call
You CANNOT hear people unless you’re in a Real Quiet place"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-25,Left ear might as well not work. EDIT - Second set is perfect,"Left ear constantly cuts in and out. Took forever to reset and pair when I first got them but the left ear just cracks and goes in and out half of the time. But other times it works perfectly fine - hard to pin down the issue. I like the feel, look, seal, and battery life - I just wish I could get that left ear to work all of the time. EDIT: Anker sent me a replacement and they have been perfect. Really glad I bought these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-25,Zero call quality,I bought these so I could make calls for work. As a remote employee my call quality is critical. People on calls with me ask me to mute because background noise is amplified. turning a page in my notebooks transfers through as if I am crumpling paper in the microphone. not happy - replacing these with something else
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-25,Exceeded expectations,"Had these for about a month now, and they have become my everyday necessity. Great battery life. Although I feel like if im not using them i put them in the charging case so i dont ever get the battery very low, it has very rarely even gotten low battery on me. Case is small enough although if case size is an issue for you, its definitely bigger than the airpods case for example. Sound has been above average although not great. They fit well in my ear so they often cancel the outside noise really well which helps with the sound quality. Overall great pair of headphones, very happy i got them."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-17,"Good earbuds, but some improvement needed.","The earbuds aren't perfect. If the phone is resting on a charging pad while I'm listening to music, music will pause for a second or two when I take the phone off the base, or set it back on the charger. Sound quality is good, although once I have the phone app set up, I rarely need to use it for anything. There is no volume control on the earbuds themselves but I'm okay using the phone for volume adjustment. I have the following configuration:
* Double tap on left ear for previous track
* Double tap on right ear for next track
* Long press on left ear for play/pause
* Long press on right ear for voice assistant
When I'm on a conference call and speaking, it's uncertain if I'm coming through clearly on the other end. I'm told that it's sort of scratchy sounding, but as I think about it, I think part of that comes from having a beard since the microphones are right next to the side burns. I confirmed this by using the Voice Memos app in IOS. If I'm not speaking at all, just moving my jaw, the microphones pick up the sound of hairs moving against the ear stalks. One feature that I feel the earbuds are missing is audio pass-through. When I'm using my over-the-ear headphones at home, my voice is passed back through to the headphones so I can hear myself and can tell how loudly to speak. With these, I can hear myself, but it's very muffled, as if I have my fingers stuck in my ears. That's something that Anker could address with a firmware update, but they probably won't. If that feature were in place, I would probably give these five stars."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-14,The best bang for the buck.,"This is the only earphones I would buy over and over after Apple AirPods, period. Build quality is surprisingly great. I been using Anker products for few years now and most of the times I am a satisfied customer. This earphones is no exemption. Case is soft touch rubberized material. Wireless charging is an added benefit. Best part in earphones itself is that it’s not one size fit all situation, you can change the rubber piece accordingly. Battery life is amazing. I would highly recommend it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-14,Best Bluetooth Earbuds I've Owned,"The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 is my 5th set of Bluetooth ear buds, and they are my third set of true wireless buds. So far I really like them a lot. They are the ONLY Bluetooth buds I've had that allow the person on the other end of a phone call to hear me well. What a pleasant surprise that has been for me. According to the marketing literature, they have a total of 4 microphones, and they really do the job well. Also, their music quality is excellent. They are very clear and crisp with rich bass, which very importantly for me does not overwhelm the rest of the music spectrum as is the case with some products. The software that you can download to configure the buds is helpful. I’ve tried different equalization settings but found the default settings to be the most to my liking. I also used the software to modify the function of the touch control that each bud has. I have it set so that the left one will either skip to the next song or raise the volume. The control on the right bud will pause the music or lower the volume. It is possible to set the functions differently if you wish. The touch controls take some getting used to but when you do they work great. Removing either bud from your ear pauses the music instantly. They apparently have some sort of proximity sensor. And supposedly you can use either bud by itself as a monaural device, but I haven’t tried that yet. The battery life is outstanding. I had one phone call that lasted 4.5 hours and only then did I get a low battery warning. And with music, I get tired of listening to music before the battery gets low. One other thing about the power is that if the buds automatically power off when you’ve had the music paused for an extended time, they can be restarted without putting them back in the charging case. This is great if you don’t happen to have the case with you on a long walk or run. In summary, the Liberty Air 2’s are my favorite of my several BT products and second only to my overall favorite – my 6-year-old Sennheiser RS-180 full-size wireless RF headphones. I would recommend this product to everyone unless you crave OUTRAGEOUS amounts of bass."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-02-12,Pairing Is A Pain - Sound is great - Use the APP for best Experience!,"I have owned and used quite a bit of Audio Bluetooth devices over the last 7 years starting with the LG tone. I have used almost 4-5 different versions of LG tone. I have used A few Samsung ""over the neck"" style as well. Most of them ended up with manufacture defects in the Long run but were great while they lasted. I have used SONY - not that impressed - same style. And have now landed on the sound core buds - Anker Soundcores version of the over the neck wireless earbuds. This is just to give a history of my expectations. These I need for the Gym and travel. As a 2nd pair for work, walking my dog, etc I have started to use the ""true wireless"" ear buds style. I really thought they were stupid at first. I laughed at the apple AirPods when they came out. I refuse to buy Apple. I started off with a cheap $40 pair from some private label branded company. This Is also what I am basing my review on. The $40 pair of 'true wireless ear buds"" paired so easy. Sound quality wasn't the best but wasn't bad for $40. I even had issue with the first one and was sent tout a replacement. (Not nocking Anker - I know they would take care of issues as well). But the point is they were easy. I never have issues with pairing with either bud. Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Wireless Earbuds
-After now being sold on the idea of true wireless earbuds I decided to spend more than $40 for a decent pair. I was between this and the galaxy buds. My thoughts? CONs:
For $100 I expected EASY. EASY pairing. It was actually frustrating. I had the same experience as many where only 1 bud paired. I had to do quite a bit of research on how to reset and fix. Things are working fine now but seems to auto pair with my laptop even with it is sleeping. I have to Shut off bluetooth on my Mac to get it to pair with my iPad or iPod (old iPhone). To me this is a pain. Pairing is better but still not consistent. I want easy. I sometimes use my $40 pair instead because I need QUICK!. PRO:
USE THE APP. If you have any sound issues I highly recommend using the APP to do the hearing test and test out the different sound options. -I do like this feature and that I do have more control of my sound. Of all the devices I have used this one does it the best if not at all. Most did not have an option. They would make you click this button than that to get your bass right etc. This feature does make it easy. -I also like that I can assign the functions through the app. For example. I did not like that with the slightest bump to the bud, the sound would pause due to the setting. Sometimes Im working at a coffee shop and touch my ear by mistake. Having the ability to change that to do something else was very helpful. I am no longer afraid to touch the buds while in my ear. I really wished I loved these more. Part of me wishes I would have paid just a bit more for the galaxy buds but honestly like the stems on the end better. The whole option to pair only 1 or 2 I think really interfered with an easy experience for us users. IF I don't want to use the other bud ill just take it out and I don't care if there is sound coming out. I just don't see the benefit. Final thoughts:
Not horrible - good sound quality which is the point. But much can be improved. If I had paid $80 I don't think Id be as upset. Or maybe I just had REALLY hight expectations. Please Anker Soundcore - Make it easier!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-11,Great customer support from Nicole,"I could not figure out how to pair them to my phone. The right one worked just fine, music, calls, etc... but the left would not connect. I called customer support but she kept rushing me through the whole process. I felt the units were fine but she wanted me to return them for quality check. Because I felt rushed through the whole pairing/reset process and the units seemed fine quality-wise I told her I would continue to work on connecting it without her.. I knew I was missing something. Without much luck, and hoping to get someone else on the line I called back ten minutes later. NICOLE walked me through each step VERY THOROUGHLY and patiently. It turned out I was resetting in their case incorrectly. With one correct reset I got each of them to work! I am now looking forward to trying them on for a workout. Big props to Nicole from customer support."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-10,You get what you pay for,"I guess that other noise cancelling earbuds must be much better, but for the price I paid for theese, I'm very happy with the results. They last a lot on a single charge."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-07,Love them but they're glitchy,I love these headphones for the most part. Unfortunately they are a bit glitchy. I tried to change the touch settings for a long touch to play the next song but it is still initiating the ok google rather than what I set it to. The double tap to play/pause works maybe half the time. And that is being generous. And it does not pause when you take it out of your ear like it says it does. These headphones will also not stay in my ears no matter what I try. I have tried all the tips that come with it as well as tips from my other pair of Anker headphones. Ironically those are the ones that fit best. I honestly wish that I had purchased something different but I am worried that I will have the same problems. If all your looking for is something wireless then these are great but if you want features that actually work I might look elsewhere. I would be happy if I spent $50 on these but they are definitely not worth the $100 IMO.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-02-04,Best value for a true wireless experience!!,"Through my experience of using these earbuds now for a couple months now they are hands down the best true wireless ear buds I have ever owned. I've pushed these ear buds the the max, dropped them, volume high and they are still running on full throttle. I've used Apple AirPods & BeatsX ear buds and these are right there with them if not better. Some of the features I love most are:
- Wireless charging case
- Dedicated Soundcore App: Hear ID
- Custom fit ear buds
- Durable & almost scratch proof case
Easy to set up and easy to connect with out any issues. Will look forward to using more Soundcore products in the future!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-03,Not comfortable,It gets uncomfortable when you wear it for more than 30 mins
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-02-02,Worth the $$,Bang for the buck. Don’t get the $20 ones. You get what you pay for. Bass is spectacular. I’m would definitely recommend
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-02,Great sound quality. Other features need work. Survived washer and dryer!,"- Sound quality VERY good and LOUD for Bluetooth. - Whenever I'm on a call with someone they almost always have trouble hearing me. I don't use these for calls anymore becaue it's so bad. - They stay put during runs and workouts
- The limited controls are pretty annoying. I'd rather have physical buttons. - Wish there was a hear through feature. - Great battery life
Overall these are solid headphones for listening to music and working out. That being said they are a little pricey considering the other features need some work. Also i just recently left them in my pocket they went though the washer and dryer. Surprisingly they still work!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-01,Good product for an awesome price,Overall it's a really good product and quality matches to that of the high end ones. However one complaint is that once in a while the left earbud has a static sound for a second or two. This only occurred 4 or 5 times in 2 months and not that big of a deal but is something that needs to fixed.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-01,Good sound quality,Really good sound but the only problem it’s the noise cancellation is too strong. It bothers my ears
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-29,Not for Conversations!!!,"If you're hoping to use these for both podcast listening & phone conversations :: FORGET IT :: I searched & searched for a pair of bluetooth earbuds that would work for everything & these were supposed to be ""the ones"". Unfortunately, the only time I could use them for phone conversations was when I was in a completely silent space. THEY PICK UP EVERYTHING even the turn signal in my car clicking OVER MY OWN VOICE!!! So disappointed! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-27,Beats Apple for the money hand down.,Wonderful product at a ver fair price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-25,Will never go back to another brand,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them! I have the version 1 which have worked well for me, but his are definitely really good too. The battery life lasts long, also they are nice because they aren’t bulky like headphones are."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-24,Pairing is not an issue. Sound is amazing.,"I read all the reviews stating that they couldn't pair. Not sure what they were doing but it took me about 30 seconds for both to pair and start playing music. The balance, bass and sound positioning was top shelf. I've only had them for a couple hours and haven't made a phone call yet so I can't speak to that. These are worth $100 easy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-24,Works great,"I don't have experience with other wireless earbuds, but this is super easy to pair with multiple devices and battery life is great. I charge about once a week, of course usage varies. But they are snug in my ears, I run on treadmill and it's much better than my other corded ones that use to pop out or get tangled on the handlebars."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-24,Great sound. Half the price of iPhone product and completely compatible.,These are great blue tooth ear plugs. Far superior to iPhone buds and completely compatible with iPhone or Android. Comes with several different sizes of ear plugs. And the buds charge in the case with the plugs attached. Half the price of iPhone buds. Stick with anker. Make great phone accessories.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-24,Very nice,Very nice
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,0,2020-01-24,"Just buy airpods, liberty air 2 full of false claims and quality issues.","These are pretty bad. For one, these are a lot bigger and heavier than something like airpods, and they fall out of my ear every single time I bend over or move much, a problem I never had with airpods. They're also not very comfortable and none of the ear tips they provided seemed to properly fit my ears, a problem I also rarely have with silicone tipped earbuds. My greatest problem with these earbuds though is that their claims of ipx5 water resistance is a straight up lie. I was brushing my teeth listening to music, and of course the right one flies out of my ear into the sink and lands in a few drops of water. It was a tiny amount of water, the water wasn't running or anything but now my right earbud is about 80% quieter on full volume than the left. I know the product description says it's only sweatproof, but if it only took a few drops of water to essentially ruin the earbud I'm sure a few drops of sweat would do the same, that is if you can even manage the miracle to keep these things in your ears while you run or work out or do basically anything. I guess you get what you pay for with these, my advice would be to spend the money on actual airpods, in my experience airpods fit perfectly, always stay in and rarely fall out even while running, sounded way better than these(the liberty air 2 sound so overblown with treble, no mid range at all, so much for ""diamond coated drivers""), and I've even jumped in a pool with airpods accidentally in and they were fine, even though they claim NO water resistance at all! The one positive I'll give these is they do seem to have a slightly better battery life than airpods, likely because as I mentioned earlier these are way bigger and heavier than airpods, but in my opinion 30 minutes to an hour of extra playtime isn't worth the earbuds falling out onto the ground every couple minutes. Plus these also have flashing lights on the earbuds themselves which can be annoying because I don't want to be the guy with blinking lights In his ears I just want to listen to music, these look sort of like futuristic hearing aides more than earbuds and they feel like it too..."

Very frustrated. I had a pair of liberty neos before that I was happy with and I thought these would be a nice upgrade .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-16,Great connection!,"Tested snowboarding with one bud in my ear and one bud in my buds ear. The phone/R/L bt connection was flawless when we were within 25ft of each other and only slightly choppy at 100ft unobstructed. Sounds great, super slick, no problems or reconnection required so far!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-15,Great quality,These work very well. Just like Apple but son loves them more bc earpiece is soft not hard.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-13,all good so far,Have been using them for the past few hours. They sound great and block out most of the outside noise. good clear and deep sound.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-09,Can’t charge without case.,These are incredibly good. However after just a few days of owning I’ve already lost the charging case. You can’t charge them without the charging case. So if you lose the charging case you’ve just wasted $100.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-08,Awful design,External Button for toggling was horribly designed
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-04,Good product but could get better with hear through,Initial review is the head phone sound really good. I would honestly say right on par with my jabra 65t active. And pretty close to my apple AirPod pro. Call quality is great right there with both the jabra and AirPods. The headphones don’t stay in the best I can feel them slipping out the second I put them in and I am constantly adjusting them back in place. After using the jabra elite 65t active for so long I got used to having the hear through mode which I loved. It would be nice to see them do a firmware update and add that feature. All around they are good headphones and my main reason for purchasing these is for the battery life when I’m working so I can listen to my music and podcast all day. Going to be purchasing the foam ear tips to see if they will help with the headphones slipping out of my ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-03,Doesn’t work,We return this headphones because left one doesn’t work.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-01-02,*updated review* they work great,We like others we could not get both earbuds connected. Each one would connect independently but not to each other. We read troubleshooting instructions online and could not achieve pairing. My husband has an iPhone so for $40 more ( or less) we can get instant pairing with apple products. These are being returned. **update** The seller contacted us and sent us another set and they paired easily on the first attempt. I have an iPhone XR and have had no difficulty with the replacement set. The customer service team was great!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-01,great for calls,better than galaxy buds. microphone is very good around noise and clear too.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-29,Great for the price!,"I just got these and they work perfect out of the box and sound really good. I had been wearing over the ear wireless headphones but wanted something less bully. My wife got the sony in ears for me but I couldn't get past the look. The soundcore 2 look and sound great. Honestly, they are better than expected, and for the price it's hard to beat. Nicely done, Anker"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-29,They're definitely worth the money,"Calls are very clear and people I've called said I could clear as well. It does reduce background noise well. It doesn't have active noise canceling and the fit is a little iffy on me, but for the most part it's perfect. Don't see myself needing to upgrade from these in a long time"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2019-12-28,"Good, but needs improvements","Bought these from best buy and I loved them for the first couple weeks. They started to have connection issues where only one would work or where the sound was too low and I had to re-pair them. They're great for stationary use or lifting weights, but horibble for cardio. For some reason, every time I run they turn on and off. Maybe it's the sweet. Overall I they're good, but could be way better."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-28,Best alternative to Air Pod Pros. Get them!,Had Air pods... Liked them but not with an Android phone. Note 10+. Tried Samsung air buds.... They sucked. Fit was bad... Sound was terrible. Returned them bought these... And they are amazing.!!!!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-26,"Good sound, difficult to properly connect","***Updated Review***
Anker provided me another set of these earbuds and I was able to get them to work. It did take about 5 tries to get them to properly connect with Bluetooth. Was then able to get the firmware update through the app and have not had an issue since. I’m raising my review from 1 to 3 stars just due to the fact that it still took several times to get both the left and right buds to properly connect. I still believe in anker products and will continue to buy them in the future. Purchased as a gift for Christmas. Spent a couple hours trying to get left side to connect. Did all of the troubleshooting techniques I could find, was able to get it to connect but after putting back in case it would stop working again...it shouldn’t be this hard to get them to work."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-26,Definitely worth buying.,Been using them every day since I got em and I love them. Best headphones I've ever had.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-25,Great sound,"If you use for occasional calls and some music, they will last a all day. Great sound and terrific separation of sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-21,Me encanta en sentido general,"Estas muy bien la calidad del sonido, la duración de la batería es buena y son muy cómodo. Lo malo es, que cuando voy en bus al trabajo, algunas veces falla el sonido como por interferencia de otras frecuencia."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-21,Pretty solid. Very few gripes,"Biggest thing was pairing them. Downloaded app. Chatted with customer service. They said to u pair, put in case, press button on case for 8 seconds until flashes red. Right bud will flash quickly. Pair in settings, no need to manually pair Left side it'll ask automatically. After that. I turned off the auto pause feature in the app because I don't like it. And switched to the second smallest buds. Wireless charging case. The only thing I want is a find my buds and case feature because they are EASY to lose."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-21,Amazing technology for the price my personalized hearing is by far the best choice it works,Don’t listen to the naysayers this is amazing technology take the hearing test multiple times you’ll realize sometimes you’re not even supposed to let go of the screen because you’re hearing completely through the test piece
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-13,"Don’t listen to the bad reviews, they’re great earbuds","In 100% honesty I had apprehensions about buying these after seeing mixed reviews. But Anker is an amazing company with great customer service so I bought them. I am so glad I did. The sound is sharp, adjustable and clean. The controls I don’t
have down yet, but I also haven’t really read the manual. The battery life is phenomenal. I also haven’t had any connection issues with my
iphone 11. Buy these earbuds, you won’t regret it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-11,Worth the cost,Comfortable and good sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-08,The best,A+++ highly recommended.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-06,Good company,Edited: Anker contacted me and replaced these headphones with a pair that worked a lot better for me. Two stars added for great customer service. I usually love Anker products but the touch controls on the headphones make them almost unusable. I have a couple of different Bluetooth headphones an these are very good as far as battery life and sound quality but not being able to quickly pause/ play music or answer a call defeats the purpose for me.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-06,"Impressive Sound Quality, Excellent Battery Life. Apple AirPod 2/ Pro can't beat","As I have several Anker products and my trust for them, I decided to give these a try to replace my broken AirPod and BeatsX(I bought some cheap but high reviews earbuds before getting to this one, they are crap). This one is the best. Build quality, sound quality with Bass, battery life is very impressive. I listen to EDI, high bass songs, pops. These earbuds is beyond what I expected. Sounds is very clear and loud enough. The iPhone app is the advantage that I can customize the music output. Connection is easy, mono or stereo mode, both are easy, take <5 seconds to auto connect. Battery life is excellent just as Anker portable battery. Wireless charging and fast charge is additional features for the price. The only con for this earbuds is noise cancellation. It doesn't have. But the in-ear design blocks some. For the price, it's well worth it. Highly recommended. Remember I don't work for anyone for writing this review or earn anything. Just want to share my experiences."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-03,the price which is way cheaper than airpods,I used these for work the sound and noise cancellation works perfect in my line of work as a welder dealing with loud metal being grinded down
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-10-16,Great Airpods alternatives! Better value than Airpods!,"Let me start by saying that I did not purchase these through Amazon. I bought them from Best Buy ($89.99) using Google Shopping as a first time customer to get a 20% discount code. I'm trying to be as transparent as I can when I do these reviews. My total came out to be less than $76 altogether after tax. Now on to the review. I own Apple's Airpods and I'll have to say.. these earbuds are just as good (if not better) as the Airpods in every facet except for connectivity with iOS devices. The sound quality is better, the noise isolation is better because of eartips, the call quality is quite on par with the Airpods, and the price is DEFINITELY better as you get way more value for the dollar with these earbuds than you do with the Airpods. If you own an Android, you have the AptX feature which enhances your audio experience even more. The HearID feature that this earbud has with the Soundcore app is very unique. It gives you your own personal EQ based on the sensitivity of how you hear. I gave it a test, and wow.. The personal EQ was way better than any EQ that came with the app including the Soundcore Signature EQ. The HearID feature works! I also own the Jaybird Vistas which is nearly a $200 TWS earbud, and I would have to say these earbuds sounds better than the Jaybird Vistas, and the Vistas are nearly $100 more. Bottom line is that these are some of the best TWS earbuds you can purchase for under $100. It's a great purchase and I'd definitely recommend these TWS earbuds for people looking for an Airpod alternative."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2019-10-12,Ok for casual use,"I saw these advertised on FB and bought them pre release at Best Buy. I own the previous model Liberty Air earbuds which have significant issues with call quality. So when I saw these advertised as having “flawless call quality” I jumped at the chance as I like the fit and sound of the earbuds but wanted to use for phone calls as well. I really wanted to like these but I was sorely disappointed. While the fit and sound were a definite upgrade from the original version, the call quality was as bad if not worse than the previous model. Call quality was extremely poor with my voice difficult to hear as the background noise was not only loud but sounded amplified as per the people on the other end of my calls. The mics picked up every noise and every breeze making the headphones completely unusable for phone calls. I proceeded to call Anker support to see if there was some way to adjust. When I called them I used the Air 2 headphones for the call outside and as expected the service rep agreed that the call quality was terrible and suggested they must be defective as he guaranteed the headphones should work better. A supervisor also verified that the call quality was poor. I was encouraged to use their online exchange process to get a replacement. After several days I finally got an answer (even though they said I would get a response in 24 hours). They could not tell me when I could get a replacement - at least a month which is well past the return window. So I have returned these and am extremely disappointed in the product and frustrated by their service. I still really want to like these headphones and hope they can sort out the quality issues and service issues. Edit 10/21/2019
Giving credit to Soundcore as they are trying to make it right with me by sending a working pair. So their service team has certainly stepped up and done a great job. But I still stand by my review of the product. Edit 11/1/2019
Soundcore did send me a new pair which I have tested with improved results but still mixed. The call quality has improved on this pair but is highly inconsistent across calls where one call is perfectly clear with no background noise and the next the other person can barely hear me. While this is an improvement over the original pair (which was obviously defective) it still needs some work. Consistency is what will drive trust and continued usage but not trusting if the call quality will be appropriate prevents me from using these as my primary headphones. Update 12/1
Soundcore has continued to step up and show great service. They sent me another pair (black) and I have used for a bit. Overall these headphones are great for music and ok for phone calls. This latest pair has better call quality than previous pairs so it seems quality control has improved quite a bit as the call quality is consistent across calls which is a big improvement but the call quality still makes me sound distant to the other party and outdoor ambient noises do interfere quite a bit. A major improvement from where we started and a decent product for occasional and casual calls with great sound for music."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-11-20,Good ... almost Great,"This is a solid set of earbuds for the price. Pairing is easy. The buttons are flexible and can be programmed with the app.
Sound quality seems great (I'm not super-picky, but it's hard to believe anyone except a true audiophile could find fault with these). Same goes for call quality. Charging is easy. For long inter-continental flights, it's great to be able to drop the buds back in their case and get more hours out of them. Only downside is noise cancellation. I've used some noise-cancelling headphones where I literally can hear almost nothing when they're on - even when there is no music playing. This set lets a fair amount of background noise in (crying baby a few rows away, pilot making announcements, etc). I'll continue to experiment with them - maybe I'm doing something wrong."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-21,Great earbuds that only fall short to their marketing,"I've been using this for the past month and I've fully enjoyed the vast majority of my time with them. They sound great for their price and form factor and have a battery life that seems to last forever since they recharge every time you put them away. The downsides come from a few areas: the fit, the mic quality, and the lack of customizability. If I had any ear wax in my ears at all, these would immediately start sliding out until I thoroughly dried out my ear canal and pushed them back in. I wear earplugs to bed so I clean my ears daily, but I would always have to clean them again before I put these in. Once they're in good, though, they will stay in without needing adjustment for the most part. My next big issue is the mic quality. It sounds terrible. I also particularly dislike how this page calls them ""noise cancelling"" when they have absolutely no noise cancelling for the audio, and the ""noise cancelling"" for the mic quality cancels out your voice as well. Unless you're talking obnoxiously loud, you'll end up extremely quiet to the recipient of your calls. I've had these work normally at the beginning of a call, but then have my voice cut out randomly a few minutes into the call. This may have been an issue with my phone, but I haven't had this issue with any other headphones. The last issue I have is their lack of customization. You can change what the double and long tap options do (I have my left set up to skip tracks and right to pause on double taps, and lowering/raising the volume on long taps), but when adjusting their fitment in your ears, you can very easily accidentally send it commands. Back into the software, it has equalization presets, but you can't make your own (even though their ""hear id"" option essentially makes a new one for you after you sit through minutes of a poor hearing test). My last gripe with the software is that these automatically stop playing as soon as you take them out of one of your ears for more than a second or two. When adjusting, you'll often need to remove them, put them back in, and then send the command to resume playing your music. I see the reason for this feature, but it's caused more harm than good, since if I'm taking them out of my ears, I'm putting them away in their case which automatically pauses the music and turns them off. Looking at this type of earbud as a whole, I don't see any benefit to it other than its portability. The charging case easily fits in any pocket and gives these as much playtime as a full size set of headphones. However, I still prefer the wireless earbuds that go around your neck and wrap around your ear. You don't hear every footstep you take adjusting the suction in your ear, and you can easily take them out of your ears for a conversation and let them sit there, rather than taking your earpods out and awkwardly putting them in your pocket. There's also no issues with them falling out. But if you need something extremely portable that you can easily put in a convenient carrying case in your pocket, then the the earpod style seems to be your best bet. So if you really need the portability or want something in this style (and don't plan on making a lot of phone calls with them), then they're great. I've been using them to walk to my classes every day and I haven't ran into any other issues yet. But just to combat the marketing, the ""diamond coated drivers"" make no noticeable difference, there is essentially no useful noise cancelling, and I don't see the point of HearID. *I received the black model (even though it was supposed to be the white one) but I'm glad, since I think it looks better and will be harder to get dirty through daily use (like keeping the case in my pocket)."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-22,Excellent sound and fit,"I was really impressed with these earbuds, certainly more than I expected to be. I've had 3 other pair in the past couple of years, and these are probably the best of the bunch. Sound is excellent, with none of the sibilance others mentioned. Bass is good for earbuds, and the app lets you up if you want to punch out your eardrums. I love how customized I can make the sound. They're also surprisingly comfortable. I usually find that earbuds start to feel really annoying after an hour or so, no matter how well I think they fit. While I never forget these are in, I don't feel like I have to take them out or go crazy. And I appreciate that I can take either one out and keep going with just one earbud, unlike some sets that only let you take out one or the other, or that keep playing through the second one while it's on your desk (why would they do that?). Overall, these are a great find and would actually be a good gift. Recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-22,A Great AIrpod Pro Alternative,"I have never been a fan of ear pods. They never fit right, fall out, and hurt my ears after a while. In contrast, I can wear on or over the ear headphones for hours without an issue. There are times where using headphones is impractical and buds are the only solution. The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2’s are the first total-wireless earbuds I have ever owned, so I can’t compare them to the original version, Apple’s Airpods or the more recent Airpod Pros. The design of the Liberty Air 2 is very similar to Apple’s Air Pod Pro in size and charging case which is slightly wider and deeper than a case of dental floss. The outside of the case has what feels like a silicone coating, it is not glossy. There are three LEDs in the front which have multiple functions. The first is to show the charge of the case, the second indicates which pod is being charged when it is inserted. If the case is closed with only one pod inserted, the LED to the furthest left or right will illuminate based on which pod it is. If both pods are inserted both the left and right LEDs illuminate. The last function shows that the case and pods are charging when connected to the USB-C port and flashes while charging until the batteries are full. The earpods are made of plastic with silicone eartips. Anker provides five sizes of tips to individualize the fit. These tips pull off and pop on. On the top of the earpod a small white LED blinks about every five seconds while there is no source being played. This probably aides in finding a lost pod. On the side of the pod that faces outward there is what I am guessing is aluminum that is touch sensitive surface that controls functions such as skip, pause/play, answer/hang up call, ignore call, voice assistant, and turn on/off. Using the Soundcore app the controls can be customized as well as adding volume +/- and previous track functions. The earpods automatically pause music when one or both are removed and a double tap on the right pod resumes play. The Soundcore app performs two functions, customizing the controls and setting the equalizer. The controller functions can be customized for both left and right double taps and 2 seconds holds. The equalizer offers a number of preset curves that match the ones is Apple Music. Anker adds its own “Soundcore Signature” EQ curve, which is definitely the best preset for these earpods. In addition to the presets, Anker has “HearID”, which provides a personal EQ profile based on a hearing test that it gives you and EQs the settings to the best possible sound based on the outcome. My profile was almost identical to the Soundcore Signature setting. Obviously the EQ settings are subjective to personal taste. Since the Liberty Air 2’s provide a pretty good seal, the one thing that is missing from the app that I wish was included is the ability to mix outside noise with the music to a favorable balance like Apple’s transparency mode. With the four microphones on each earbud you would think that would be a no brainer. Hopefully that will be added as a function in a future update of the app and/or firmware. The Liberty Air 2’s have impressive bass response, while they seem to roll off the very lowest frequencies. These earpods also lack the warmth that I like in the lower midrange frequencies leaving a flatter sound without a lot of “airiness”. Usually I would describe the high frequencies on over the ear headphones as crisp and clear, but the Liberty Air 2 has more of a “crunchy” sounding high end with some compression. There is also a little of bit of “essing” (Yes that is truly an audio term) at times, but that is barely noticeable. Overall the sound is very good, but not excellent, it’s a little bit on the bright side. I never expected such tiny drivers to mimic the large drivers of over or on the ear headphones. As stated before, I’m not sure how the sound is compared to Apple’s Airpods, I never heard them, but for those who don’t want to shell out the dough for an Apple product probably won’t be disappointed with the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 total wireless earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-25,"overall good headphones, limited touch controls","Was excited about these headphones because of the touch controls; I'd previously owned bluetooth earbuds with touch controls and I liked them way better than my earbuds with only a button, touch controls can offer a lot more flexibility. Unfortunately the controls on these are limited and only a few gestures are available. Overall they're good headphones though, comfortable with good sound. Pros:
- magnetic lid on case makes it feel snappy, the magnet could be a little stronger though
- magnets also keep the headphones in
- lights indicate charge status, lights can also be activated by a button on the bottom of the case
- case is sleek and slim
- headphones are comfortable, comes with additional ear pieces. - music pauses when a headphone is taken off, but unfortunately doesn't resume when you put it back in
- easy to sync
- wireless charging surprising useful in keeping the headphones charged. - USB C
- charges quick
Cons:
- minor interference in crowded areas
- limited functionality of touch controls. There aren't enough gestures to enable more than a few functions. Can't control volume, back/fwd, play/pause all at the same time. Hoping this can be updated with software. - slight delay when watching videos. Other:
- touch controls might need a little getting used to"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-11-28,"Very Good, But Several Opportunities for Improvement","I’ve been using these earbuds for a few weeks now, and I’ve tested them in a variety of conditions both for listening to music and for making phone calls. The summary conclusion is that these are pretty darn good, especially at a price quite a bit lower than AirPods, but I presume AirPods are nearly flawless. These earbuds are far from flawless and probably super good for many. Let’s start with the positives:
+ Sound Quality: Superb sound quality, based on my past experience with other earbuds and headphones. The frequency range seems very good, as I can hear quality treble and bass. Music sounds rich and room filling, which was a bit of a surprise from earbuds. + Quality App: The app is very good, too. There is a hearing test that will allow you to get a customized EQ setting. I did that test, and the resulting EQ settings were OK. Truth be told, I much prefer the many other EQ settings in the app. See included screen shots for EQ settings. I really like the Acoustic setting for both good treble and adequate bass notes, but many of the others are fun at times, too. + Build Quality: Everything about these earbuds says premium quality, right down to the fancy packaging. They do not seem like cheap junk, and we’ve all owned cheap junk before. + Earbud Size Fittings: The rubbery tips that help the earbuds to stay stuck in your ears are plentiful. Including the size that comes on the earbuds, there are 5 choices. So whether you have tiny ear canals or monstrous ones, there are rubbery tips for you. I’ve also found that they are very high quality tips. I’ve removed them when they got sweaty and greasy to wash them under water with soap, and they held up well. Washing them restores their tackiness to stay lodged in your ears. + Smart Operation: when you remove the earbuds from your ears, the music stops. Don’t ask me how it know they are no longer in your ears. Smart, right? + Cool Design: From the look of the earbuds to the look of the little storage/charging case, things look cool. In addition, the storage/charging case works flawlessly. So, what do I not like so much, which made these 4 stars, not 5? - Feeling Like They’ll Fall Out: This totally depends on what you are doing. When I was jogging, I didn’t feel like they’d fall out. However, when I wore them weightlifting at the gym, they always started to slip out of my ears when I was bench pressing. I assume this is because every muscle in my body is contracting, and this means that my ear canals are moving. I wish that I could wear them without feeling like I need to press them back into my ears so often. This gets worse when I am sweating, as the tackiness of the earbuds is reduced by oily sweat. - Magnetic Charging Case Closure: Why oh why did they decide that a simple magnetic closure on the storage case was adequate? It’s not enough. Whether in your pocket or in your hand, you’d be much better off if you could securely close the lid. It’s doesn’t want to stay shut. The closure is too weak. If it comes open, you could lose your earbuds. - Wrong USB Cord Connection for Charging Case: The USB side of the charging cord is fine, but the other end is not what you find on 99% of non-Apple gadgets. Rather, it’s the oval connection, which means you better not lose the charging cord, because the 99 other cords you have won’t work! It sure would have been nice if they didn’t have to be original on something dumb like this. - Under Water Phone Calls: If you’re like me and cannot stand the sensation of not being able to hear yourself speak or you have water plugging your ears, you will hate making calls with these earbuds. Because they complete seal off your ear canal, you cannot hear through the ear where this is inserted. That makes talking on the phone really awkward, and I have avoided doing it of late. I’d rather hold a headset up to my head than use these earbuds for a call. - Sweaty Ears: Even when I’m just working in front of my computer, I find that I have to take out these earbuds periodically, as my ear canals get sweaty from being plugged up with earbuds. This is mildly annoying. You decide, based on my positives and negatives, how you’d rate these earbuds. Maybe they’re still 5 stars for you. I like them very much. I do not love them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-03,Love these!,"I’m incredibly pleased with these! I received a black pair as opposed to the white/pink and that was a nice surprise! These are my graduation from the cord version. I was so skeptical about these staying in my ears and being comfortable. No problems with either. I may be in the minority because I’ve never owned this style of buds but the charging case is a real selling point for this girl who looses things (hence why I stayed with the wired version!). The case helps me keep them together and it fits very well inside one of my small purse pockets or in my pants pocket. The lights ensure I’m keeping them properly charged. I had not a single issue getting them to connect with my devices (car when privacy is necessary, phone and tablet). The battery life is excellent. I can keep them with me and use them regularly during the day and have yet to need a charge. The sound quality is superb. But I’m not an expert on that subject. They’re definitely noise canceling and my music, video and call sound quality is excellent. I’m grateful for the opportunity to test these ear buds. I recommend them as a budget friendly option."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2019-12-08,A nice 2.0,"I have a pair of the original Soundcore LIberty Air wireless earbuds and really loved them. Much better sound quality than Apple's Airpods. But eventually, the left earbud wouldn't connect and nothing I tried fixed it. These correct that issue. While retaining the sound quality, the nice fit, the extraordinary battery life and the ease of setup. The latter is worth expanding on. Out of the box, you are told to hold the connect button for 3 seconds (very much like an Apple product). The connection is made and the earbuds work! Just like that. I have had a few times where one earbud or the other doesn't connect, but simply putting them back in their case and reinserting them after has been enough. These are my primary earbuds now and I only use my Airpods on my secondary phone."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-08,Best headphones I've used,Freaking awesome! Better than Airpods!

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2019-12-11,Not good,Not good specially for phone calls
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-13,Worth it,Everything about these are amazing. Big upgrade from the first ones. The only complaint I have is that when I try to answer a call with the touch controls it answers then hangs up. I haven't investigated too much. It's not a problem for me since I always have my phone near me.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-15,Great earbud but bad app with connecting earbuds to costumize sound,Great earbuds but my problem only is soundcore app keep having with pairing both earbuds together even though they both pair together I can't use their app cause pair issue on the app it keep saying have both pair connect but they are to already both pair
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-17,Hit the nail on the hammer,They r perfect they came in two days an r the best purchase I've made so far
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-19,These are awesome!!! Soundcore has won me over!!,"First of all, when you buy these you must download the soundcore app to your device. Having this app will update the firmware and then everything is seamless. These are great for calls, you can use left or right for talking, there are 5 or 6 rubber tips for perfect comfort. The sound when listening is great for ear buds, no signal loss when in grocery stores, not even in the back rooms of a Wally World. The battery life has been amazing, I dont really listen to both buds at same time so, take that into account but i made it throw the whole day with one era piece playing music and talking, more talking than listening. These are perfect for the person who does not want to pay $250 buck for ear buds and enjoys quality sound and clarity during phone calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-22,Love these,Great upgrade. Being able to use my left ear only instead of being forced to use my right ear when I only wear one at a time has been much better for me! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-24,Not bad,"Decent product, no major complain but is going back because of a poor fit. It is my ear, not you Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-25,Left ear bud stopped working.,"Left ear bus stopped working soon after I stated using it. Sucked, bc a friend highly recommended theses after I had failures with Bose Sport and another wireless brand from Best Buy..."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-25,Great call quality for not a lot of $$,"I am an Apple user and really wanted the Apple AirPods but wasn’t willing to drop that much $$. I bought these with low expectations, but have been thoroughly surprised. The sound quality is amazing and calls are clean and crisp. Everyone that I’ve talked to using them has said that they can hear me very clearly."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-25,Fully satisfied,Product worked as advertised.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2019-12-25,Thumps up,I got this for my man. He loves it. Amazing sound quality. Music sounded so so much better. Usually he can't hear me clear over the call. This headset did a good job
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2019-12-26,Pairing issues but amazing customer service,"I have to say upfront that this entire review is based on the price point. At sub $100 these will serve you well if you receive a working set. Many great features, awesome anker support should you require it, battery life is good, sound quality is where it should be for a sub $100 pair of earbuds with an occasional crackle and pop. Some weird quirks that we eventually figured out but we came to the conclusion that the next revision of the liberty air will most likely be a keeper. The liberty air 2 falls just short. A lot of pros but just enough cons to return the liberty 2. I purchased these for a Christmas present. She was very happy and could not wait to use them. Everything was fine at first but we slowly discovered some annoying flaws. First the positives. Price point is amazing, sub $100! Provides most of the features that the much more expensive competitors have. Battery life is absolutely amazing. The app is nice but not really needed after you setup the functions. She was able to get through the day listening to music, calls, even an active recovery day workout with no issues of the battery dying. Sound is fair, on par with slightly higher priced earbuds but nothing amazing. Now the cons. Pairing is by far the biggest gripe we have. First time pairing seemed to work but only the right earbud had sound. We reset the unit and paired successfully but the left earbud only plays. After several attempts, reading the manual and watching a YouTube video we could not get both earbuds to play consistently. Eventually both earbuds worked but again one of the two would cut out leaving only one playing music. After a few days of tinkering around and having mixed success she had enough and wanted to return them. I felt bad that my present was ultimately a dud. Placing a return here shortly and will most likely get the AirPods. Our experience was mixed, many other reviewers had great success but we did not have that consistent confidence that these earbuds would work. Always a good experience w/ anker but this time we did not. Update 02/23: anker/soundcore customer service is always great to deal with. I’ve been working with Michelle on troubleshooting some of the quirks with the Liberty’s. My original rating went from a 3 to 1 and now after the great customer service provided by Michelle the rating is now a 4. She provided 5 star service but ultimately the Liberty 2 has just enough shortcomings to subtract one star. Had it not been for Michelle and her great troubleshooting and customer service I would’ve left the rating at 1 star. Thanks to Michelle we can work with some of quirks. Thank you Michelle!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2019-12-28,"They look and sound great, but...","Although these earbuds look very nice and they sound great, there are two problems which make them unsatisfactory:
1. There are a lot of instructions online describing how to pair these earbuds but it took a long while to find earbud pairing instructions that came close to causing the earbuds to pair. The problem was that the left earbud wouId not work. I was able to extend the instructions and get the earbuds to consistently pair, but they would consistently un-pair once they were put back into the case. Definitely inconvenient. 2. They were a gift to my daughter. None of the earbud sizes would work for her. They didn't work for her. EDIT
Anker offered to send me a free pair of the Liberty 2 because of the inconvenience my daughter and I experienced with the Liberty Air 2. I had already purchased ear buds from another company for my daughter but decided to accept the offer since I also have problems with ear buds staying in the ear and I wanted to see if the Liberty Air would have the pairing problems that we had with the Liberty Air 2.
The ear wings work. There are three ear wing sizes and more ear bud covers than the Liberty Air 2 has. The ear wing holds the ear buds securely in as I move around. The pairing also works with the Liberty 2. I tried finding some way that they wouldn’t pair but haven’t found anything so far – they just pair up. The Liberty 2 is a great product! I have purchased many Anker products in the past, including Anker SoundSlims, and been very pleased. I am disappointed that the Liberty Air 2 buds didn’t work out but the Liberty 2 do. I’m changing my rating from one star to three stars because Anker goes to great lengths to satisfy customers even when the original product doesn’t fit or consistently stayed paired."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2019-12-29,"Average-to-good sound, Great battery life","These wireless earbuds were quickly stolen by my kids, who've put them through a torture test for me. They still survive, which counts for a lot. There's a lot to like with these ear buds. The sound quality is average-to-good, but it won't knock your socks off. It's good enough that you most likely won't be bothered. The noise cancellation feature is not very noticeable -- it just feels like a good seal on the ear. (I've worn noise-cancelling earphones where you instantly ear background noise decrease -- this is not the case here.) Where these ear buds really shine is in their battery life. The kids can go days without charging them. The charging system is pretty cool, too. The case has a built-in battery for recharging. Charge the case and you've got a mobile charging station for on-the-go recharges. It works well to toss the unit in a backpack and have the earbuds recharged in a couple hours. Overall, they're of good enough quality to compete with those produced by that Fruity Company, but for a fraction of the cost. About the only thing you're giving up is the herd mentality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-01,"Took some work to connect, but great once connected","Took a bit of playing around to get them to connect correctly with my iPhone 11 Pro Max, but once connected, they work great!"

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-06,Much Better Than Airpods,"What can I say, I did not want to spend so much money on a pair of Apple Airpods. While I don't wear earphones everyday. I've had really good results from all of the sound products that I've purchased from Anker/SoundCore. I really like the ability to use a single one (by itself) as a earpiece for phone calls (can't stand using the phone with ""stereo"" earphones)."

Earbuds for"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-06,I really want to like them...but my ear shape does not allow them to stay in place,"I have tried all of the different tip sizes in each ear without success. I have a set of Beats as well as wired set of Bose for which the beats are over the ear and I do not consider a fair comparison, but the Bose fitment is simply secure and comfortable, but they have wires. Overall the sound quality is good and what I bought them for was to use as a replacement for my single Bluetooth earbud--- I use it primarily for phone calls. Battery life is also good and noise cancelling was the best that I have had so far with the 30+ headsets I have owned. The negative for me, and it is me, is that I cannot get them to stay in place. If I put them in and do not move, they eventually work themselves a bit loose. Any talking and movement of my face--- that time frame is very short to the tune of less than 1-minute and eventually will fall out. Try eating something and listening to music, well, for me they pop out immediately. I have tried all of the tip sizes which was great to have in both my left and right ear--- again it has to be my ear shape as none held either side in properly. So I have to give a mostly 5-star review but since they do not stay in place I am closer to a 3-1/2 star as they should fit with one of the tip options. Unfortunately they are going back as overall I do like them and just wish they would stay in place. What I am looking at? Not so sure yet. Wish they worked, but my quest continues."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-06,Great earbuds for the money!,"I had a little trouble connecting the earbuds the first time but once I did, I am glad I bought these. The fit, feel, sound, and connectivity is great! I have run, sweat, weight lifted, and even played racquet ball with the earbuds and not once have they fallen out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-07,Just pay a little more for apple air pods,"If you are debating between getting these and apple air pods, just spend a bit more for air pods, especially if you have an iphone. I cannot stand apple or their products but in a side by side comparison, the apple airpods sound and function better. I cannot speak to their battery life or longevity. But from purely a fit, function, and sound stand point, these ear buds lose."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-08,"Great Customer Service, earbuds good as well","First set, in white, were great, for about 2-3 weeks. Started getting a crackle/buzz in the left ear. (minus 1 star)
I tried all the reset options, including setting them up on 2 other phones. Same problem within a minute. I contacted Anker through Amazon, they wanted me to ship them back, and they would ship me a replacement pair. No offer to ship me the replacements before receiving the bad pair, no offer to use my CC to, ""keep me honest"". Not a big deal. I still had what I bought these to replace with, and they still worked fine. Took a week to be delivered to Anker's support location. It turns out they didn't have any to ship back to me. Which is possibly why they did not offer to ship a pair while I shipped the bad ones in. I was asked if they could ship me a black set as they would have those in stock earlier than the white ones. I said yes, as that was what I had originally wanted anyway. It took another almost 2 weeks to get the replacements, and as far as I can tell, they are new. Box appeared to be unopened and everything was there. So far these have lasted ~2 months without the buzz/crackle coming back. Noise cancellation is ok, but for me that is good. I don't necessarily want noise cancellation when I run. Can use in the left only or right only ear. I love this as I prefer to use only the left ear for calls. Audio quality is, ""good enough for my ears"". I am not an audiophile, and if I were, I would probably pass on these for some $250+ wired cans. For what these are, they are just fine. I didn't have a need to use them for around a week, and they didn't need a charge, and synced up with my phone just fine when I did need them. I wish the cap on the case was held closed a bit stronger. It does not open in my pocket, but I have had the case open while putting them in my pocket."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-10,"Great sound, work straight out of the box ... awesome value!!","I really enjoy these earbuds, and actually bought another pair for myself (the first pair were a gift for my teenage daughter). They work wonderfully, are easy to use and set up, snd they sound great!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-11,Awesome ear buds !!!,"Great ear buds for the money. Battery life is really nice, usually a whole day at lower listening levels in the office."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,0,2020-01-11,expensive piece of junk,"you have to do all sorts of tactics of to get it to connect to your computer with sound, like turning your bluetooth off and on, reconnecting and disconnecting the device, resetting the airbuds...it's like diffusing a bomb. battery doesn't last for long. now after a solid month of using these it doesn't work in the right ear. wonderful
clearly most people left a review as soon as they got them instead of waiting to see how they hold up."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-11,Good value,Why buy Apple when you can get these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-01-12,"SOUNDCORE, ADD Transparency mode via firmware update.","I REALLY like these. I’ve had most IEM and true wireless headsets. My last set was the Jabra 65t elites, which I used for years, but weren’t great at phone calls. The ONLY thing these need, is a firmware update to push transparency mode to them. If that happens, these will be the best quality earbuds I’ve used to date, and a phenomenal airpods pro alternative."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-13,I had no issues,"Do any of these people actually read the instructions???? Guy on here wrote he could get only one to work, i had the same issues out of the box. In the directions, clearly state put headphones in the case, to hold the function button on the case for 10 or more seconds and the lights on both flash red 3 times. This resets them completely. Have your phone reconnect connect, select pair and done. after that i used the Soundcore app to update firmware. DO NOT LET THESE IGNORANT FOOLS SCARE YOU FROM BUYING THESE. PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO READ THE DIRECTIONS"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-15,Great Device with Amazing Customer Service,"I ordered mine last year and they arrived quickly and worked with my iphone, samsung, and laptop. The battery life is amazing and being able to use either left or right bud independently were a must. Recently has to contact anker support because the left ear piece starting having issues. They were extremely helpful in troubleshooting the issue and replacing them. All in all great device for a great price and awesome support, would buy again from them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-17,Better then Apple AirPods,Theses are so awesome
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-19,Great sound - easy to use - stay put in ear,These are a great deal compared to bigger brand names. They sound great and stay in your ear. Nice case and easy to use. Great buy
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-20,Not great with iPhone,My hope was that for almost half the price of AirPods (with wireless charger) I could get wireless charging Bluetooth headphones. These were very difficult to pair with my iPhone X and had trouble maintaining a connection to my phone while I was carrying it in my pocket. I tried them for a couple of days and they just didn’t work as well as I had hoped. Maybe it was an Apple thing but they would keep dropping signal for a 1/2 second when I was walking around. I ended up just going with AirPod 2’s and they have worked flawlessly. Instant pairing the first time and absolutely no dropping of signal. I also found that there was a delay with these headphones. I use a learning app and it would always cut off the front of a sentence as the app started speaking. This doesn’t happen with the AirPods
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-20,Great battery life; great sound,Great battery life; great sound; the Soundcore app enables you to tune the sound to match your specific hearing profile. One downside for the Soundcore buds is that the documentation is hopeless - poor pictograms printed in 2pt font in light blue on a white background. Agh!. I did have a lot of problems pairing both buds. Both Left and Right appear for pairing on your phone (or whatever device). I blew a lot of time trying to pair both to my phone. Wrong. You have to pair them to each other (which they do automatically) and then pair *one* to your phone. very nonintuitive. Apart from that frustration I'm super pleased with the quality and price point!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-20,Not quite lived up to the hype,"<UPDATE> Ankur customer service got in touch with me and refunded the amount in full as a goodwill gesture. Must say, the gesture is greatly appreciated and reflective of a culture that is putting in effort to make amends. Now, it remains to be seen if they can close the gaps in the product itself, namely, gesture control responsiveness, connectivity and microphone noise isolation. 1. Mid-range sound is good but bass is wanting while running. You will need noise cancellation, so get ready to fork out the extra $150
2. Connection and pairing are extremely poor. While switching between my iPad and phone, i have to completely reset the headphones and pair again
3. Battery life is excellent
4. Fit is snug
5. The gesture / tap control is patchy and poor. Works intermittently"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-22,Great sound!!,Sound and build quality are great. Only thing that was difficult was the initial setup. Only one earbud wanted to connect. But they sound great.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-23,These sleek puppies fit and tune right in!,"The fit is superb! For my ears - often inadequate volume can be an issue - in these the whole factor minimal. When a firmware update is made (per agreement) let us know the install & start - up are done because the screen suggests both an instruction to wait and a check signal to take the next step. If you take the next step then you are not sure if the other step took or if you can reverse the step to correct an error. Flow ~ man. Product remains dependable, sturdy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-01-23,Updated review!!,I must of gotten a defective pair.... a horrible hissing sound every time the music or videos went silent ..the battery life was great and I definitely like the way they look I really wanted them to work for me because I love the look and feel...(update 2/11/20) Anker reached out to me and sent me a replacement pair and so far they are working perfectly..no hissing noise.. great fit and battery life and clear calls.. Anker costomer service is awesome. I use and love their solid products
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-01-25,Good features but slighty less bass for a bass head.,"If you are looking for earphones with deep bass, these are not the ones. Clarity is present though, they were NOT easy to pair at first but now they pair seamlessly if I even said it right lol, it does have good features and recently added custom EQ! But overall I just wish they had a tab more bass that I was looking for. THEY DONT SOUND TERRIBLE, just not enough bass for a bass head."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-01-31,Great sound quality. HORRIBLE controls,"Okay so I like these for business calls and call quality but the touch controls DO NOT WORK. I jam the ear pieces into my ear so much it hurts and they won’t turn on or off with phone calls. So annoying!!! The liberty pro 2 headphones and they barely response to touch - I hit them, touch them, press them, nothing works. I either heave to do all my controls like answering calls on the phone and transferring sound back to the headphones or miss calls. So if you are on one long phone call it’s fine but if you need to answer calls and hang up all day and also want to use voice assistance these earpieces are not usable. Why would they make this pretty decent product with TERRIBLE NON RESPONSIVE controls. sad product blunder."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-01,THE most FRUSTRATING pair of headphones I’ve ever experienced.,"I second what other people are saying here. I am beyond frustrated with these headphones. My husband and I spent a lot of time reviewing top rated products with features we needed and I settled on these- super excited about the personalized hearing test and the ability to filter out surrounding noise (which I really liked for business calls). I spent double on these headphones what I’ve ever spent but it seemed worth it for the quality and capability! Then they arrived. I literally spent over an hour troubleshooting them- just to get them to work out of the box! When you’re a parent with a toddler running around, your life really needs simple and user-friendly. These are NOT that. There are virtually NO instructions that come with them-just 3 pretty useless booklets, one of which consists of a few confusing pictures which- being a relatively intelligent individual- I could still barely figure out. The app wouldn’t let me get past the pairing stage to even GET to the other features. It kept telling me that I had to pair both headphones. The frustrating part is they WERE both paired from the Bluetooth side- I kept having to connect and disconnect, etc. It still showed that only one side was connected via the app.
I looked at everything and finally found some small print saying that not every device is compatible so it will appear like it’s not connecting to both?? So that means I virtually can’t get to any of the features in the app. It also said it should still play through both ears but for the life of me I couldn’t get it to work... it only plays out of one earbud. For the price of these they are the most hassle-laden electronic I have ever purchased. I am so annoyed by the process, lack of instructions, and hurdles to get it set up that I’m sending these back and buying something that doesn’t take a rocket scientist to operate. Truly disappointing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-02,Great Overall Product,"Excellent battery life, very good sound quality, and pairs to device easily. Its just easy to fall out of ear at times."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-02-03,Dual pairing works! Do earbuds reset and firmware update.,"Having my morning ☕️ , 🎶 on. Picked up new earbuds 🎧 . Previous one’s died last week. I’m happy with my purchase. Anker soundcore liberty air 2.
At first I couldn't get both left and right, which can be used by themselves, to work together. After some extensive research, a reset and firmware update, all is working well. The charging case is reasonably small which was a factor in my purchasing decision. Apparently it has wireless charging too. Nice feature. Battery life they say is 7 hrs, the case to add another 28 hrs I believe. I've only had them half a day so we will see. I will be sure to push the envelope and circle back adjusting my review score if need be. Soundcore has a companion app which has an equalizer as well as a customizer for touch control settings options for each earbud. I set the equalizer to bass booster and must say I'm fairly impressed. For Bluetooth earbuds under $100 they sound pretty good using bass booster for my music tastes. Touch controls where equally impressive. Two more options, there are four, would have been ideal, but I can live with it. The main option I was looking for was volume control. For my setup, I chose volume up, volume down, play pause, next track. Previous track never seemed to work. It just restarted the current track irregardless of how quickly I tested this setting. Other options include Siri, previous track, possibly another one or two having to do with receiving calls I can't recall at the moment. Phone conversations I'm told are clear. I'm not much of a ""phone talker"" so this isn't a priority; that is, controls on the earbuds, etc. I'm assuming these are built in by default but I usually grab my phone and answer the phone via touch screen rather than tapping earbuds. I'll have to test this out. So that's it. All and all I'll give it a 4 out of 5 stars."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-04,Would recommend,Absolutely worth the money
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-04,They are great,They sound great! Took a while to pair with my Pixel 3XL phone but I just reset them and they paired easily.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-05,**Updated Review** Disappointed,"**Updated Review**
I purchased a pair of these headphones for myself about 6 months ago. I really liked them so I ended up purchasing this pair as a Christmas gift for my wife (You can see the original review my wife left below). My wife has had her pair just over 2 months and now one of the earbuds is no longer working! The little power light on the earbud doesn't turn on even when its in the case. I though maybe the issue was just with her charging case so I tried charging her earbuds in my case but it still doesn't work. It's so much more disappointing that I have a pair that still works well after heavy use but the pair I bought her as a gift were used lightly and they're already broken. My return window is closed so now my wife has one working earbud and we're out $100. As much as I like the pair I have, I just can't recommend these because it seems like the quality is hit or miss. **Original Review**
I got these as a Christmas gift, so I'm about a month and a half in, and so far I love them! I use these pretty much daily and have only had to charge them twice, and they still have plenty of juice left. The sound quality is good, clear, and consistent. The only thing that I haven't quiet figure out is the tap controls, it's probably user error but I accidentally pause or skip stuff sometimes. Not a super big deal. Definitely worth a buy!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-06,Daughter like it with excellent sound quality.,Good sound quality but a bit of difficulty connecting to phone.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-02-06,Not sure these are worth the price but they do some things well,"First off, most users who say these fall out either have weird ears, or more likely, they're just not pushing them in far enough. With this style of in-ear headphone that's designed to seal in the ear canal you have to use the correct tip size and it can help to moisten the tip to help it slide in deep enough. That's true of any of this style. Many people are used to the Apple style that just rest in the ear (no rubber tip) but those block hardly any sound. And all those complaining about pairing issues it's either the device they're trying to pair with, they didn't bother to read the instructions, or just don't know what they're doing. I've paired mine with two different laptops, an iPad, and Android tablet, and an Android phone all without a single issue. Admittedly Bluetooth pairing can be a bit fussy sometimes but that's true for any Bluetooth headphones not just these. Those complaining about only one ear working didn't pair them correctly. Again, just read the manual. It's a feature a lot of people use for hands free phone calls to wear just one earbud so most of the better truly wireless Bluetooth headphones support pairing with just one earbud for that reason. For everyone who says they can't get back to using two of them at once, just follow the reset procedure in the manual (it's available online you put them in the case, wait for both to light up, and press the reset button on the bottom of the case for 10 seconds). Those complaining about Bluetooth range, static, dropping out, etc, it's likely their device not the headphones. I can make it to almost the other end of my house before they start dropping out. Properly inserted these block more ambient noise than most. Note they do not have ACTIVE noise cancelling as Anker sort of shamelessly implies. There are only 3 ACTIVE noise cancelling wireless self contained earbuds on the market right now (Feb 2020) and they're all at least twice as expensive (Apple Pro's, Sony and Samsung). The properly inserted part can be a bit fussy for the best sound quality. The battery life is amazing, the voice prompts and chimes are more useful than most, and some might like how the white ones look like Apple Air Pods. That's about the end of the good news. THE BAD NEWS: Why only 3 stars? My biggest complaint is the mediocre sound quality at this price. Without EQ the bass is weak and the bass they do can be rather muddy. The upper midrange and highs can be grating and harsh. The sound quality is also more dependent on fit than most similar earbuds. The other bad news is they tend to slowly work their way out of your ear canal over time (not to the point of falling out without giving you lots of warning first). As they do so what bass they do have diminishes and they stop blocking external sounds. Everyone who says they sound great likely hasn't heard a decent set of earbuds and that includes Apple's thoroughly mediocre headphones both wireless and wired. Yeah, they're more neutral than some of the cheap Chinese no-name bluetooth earbuds but that's not saying much. The controls are also erratic and and unpredictable at least when using them without the app (such as with your laptop). To power them off (without returning them to the case) you have to hold for 8 seconds which is annoyingly long. SUMMARY: These are premium in some ways but the sound quality should be better at this price and the other issues are annoying. It's sad because Anker has had plenty of experience with models before these and should be able to get it right more often. I have to wonder if they just have their name slapped on random Chinese designed products as there's little consistency between their various models."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-12,Absolutely worth upgrading over cheaper Liberty Air,"**Choose THESE over Liberty Air**
I originally bought the cheaper/older version, the Liberty Air headphones. Don’t do it! They sound tinny, high notes get staticky, and everyone I talked to complained of hearing themselves echo. Not satisfactory. These are way better. My mom couldn’t tell I was talking on headphones. Calls and music are super clear. She already has a pair I bought her for Christmas and loves them. The design of the earbuds and case are superior and have a better feel than the Liberty Air. The battery life on my mom’s is adequate for a day of on/off listening while putting them back in the case between listens. She charges them in the case every night and has never had the battery die during the day. Highly recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-12,"Comfortable, great-sounding earbuds!","I decided to buy myself wireless earbuds after both of my adult children told me how great they are. I went the inexpensive route and bought a different brand, but they were disappointing--they weren't comfortable and the call quality was very poor. Since good call quality was the most important feature for me, I returned them. My son had done a lot of research before buying his Soundcore earbuds, so I went with his recommendation. I absolutely LOVE them! The call quality is great (which is essential for my business), the sound quality is great, they are comfortable, and they help me stay ""in my own little world"" when I need to concentrate during work. So far the battery life is great, but I can't speak to the longevity, since I have only had them since Christmas. So far, though, I love them!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-02-13,these are great,"i did not mine here, but i love them i got them at walmart. wow they sound very good i love to hook them to my pc and my ipad and apple tv. they performe best with my ipad or apple tv. so i recomend these i just love the balanced sound and they have great base! and light in my ears also! well happy shopping everyone.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-19,I recommend these!!!,Very good truly wireless earbuds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-20,Great sound but problems...,They sound great when able to get them to pair. My experience is exactly like Jack (Top review). I had trouble with both android and iPhone getting to pair. I only got sound on right one most times and frustrating trying to get both. The customer service was excellent!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-02-21,Not good for calls,"I've had the Soundcore Liberty Air 2s for little over a month and love the style, size, charging case, comfort and sound quality of these earbuds. When it comes to using them for calls is the reason for such a low rating. The microphone sensitivity is not good. Lately during nearly every call, the person on the other end comments on how loud everything around me is. Even when I'm alone in a room doing work. I have to sit nearly motionless during a call or the person on the other end can hear everything I'm doing. When I first started using them, this wasn't the case. They have firmware version 04.20 which says it's up to date. I don't know if something changed with this firmware version versus what was installed when I first started using them. Since I bought these primarily for phone calls, this is a major issue. I hope it's firmware related and a new version comes out soon."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-25,"2nd version, even better!",Love these freaking things! I had the first version and I loved those.... Great improvement on the 2nd version!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,0,2020-02-26,Absolutely Awful Product All Around,"I’d give these earbuds a 0 star rating if I could. I’ve had them 5 minutes and I’m already experiencing issues getting sound to come out of both buds at once. The sound quality is alright, but I haven’t even had the chance to hear both buds playing at once. Getting them both to pair at the same time is impossible, I’ve been trying at it since I opened the box. There’s also one other huge thing that’s making me absolutely hate these earbuds. THEY DO NOT STAY IN YOUR EAR. It’s one of the most frustrating things to have a pair of earbuds WHICH ARE DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVE AND MOVE AROUND A LOT, to slip out of your ear at the most subtle of movement. I’ve tried every ear bud size. I wouldn’t spend more than $20 on a pair like this. It seems to be pretty common that they both don’t pair together. Horrible, absolutely horrible."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-02-27,no recomendable,"el primero que me compré tenía un defecto en la batería, una llamada que podía extenderse a 7 horas como te lo venden, a las 3 horas y algo te comienza a decir batería baja, el auricular derecho tiene problemas. lo devolví y pedí uno exactamente igual pero sin defectos. me mandaron uno que ya a la hora y 20 minutos me dice batería baja y ahora para empeorar el auricular izquierdo no le funciona el micrófono."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-27,Excellent for the price,"Good bass response, but not as much as I had hoped for. Soundcore’s equalizer app and presets are excellent."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-28,My current go-to earbuds,"I bought these for my husband, he didnt want them so I ended using them. I was hesitant to buy uncorded earbuds, fearing i would easily lose them, but so far so good. The sound quality is great. It is does a good job of minimizing noises outside of the buds, thats a pro and a con for me since I listen to podcasts while I drive, grocery shop, etc and interact with my surroundings. I like that if you take one bud out the sound pauses, and thats probably why I havent lost one yet. It took some getting used to at first, but now I like that feature. If I yawn, sometimes an bud falls out, but I use them at the gym and running, have not had an issue with them falling out. When I have made phone calls others have said my voice sounds tinny and echoes. I love that it uses a C type cord to charge, i hate having to use a different cord than my phone. Battery life is great. When I got theses, I planned to return them. After using them for a week, i am pleasantly surprised."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-02,These are an excellent budget conscious choice,"Pros:
They sound great! Big bass and wonderful sound. These get plenty loud for me and I’m a crank the music or pod casts in the car on my long commute kinda guy. It’ll be loud enough for you too. Very comfortable with the largest tips. The tips are softer but have a sturdy feel to them. Noise cancellation works the best with the correct fitting tips
The case is wireless charging capable. Note, you need a flat charging pad. They don’t seem to work with the upright phone chargers. They feel light in my ears. Cons:
Wish they had a feature that allows some ambient noise to come through. I’d like this for the office but not the gym. Something to toggle on and off would be great so I can control it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-02,Great item!,Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-03,I'm a Fan!,"I bought these headphones mainly because I bought a pair of the first gen from Target to mainly use for workouts and runs. As big of a fan I am of Anker, I was so let down on how frustrating and un-intuitive it was to get the two earbuds to pair in stereo mode. I then, decided to pull the trigger and buy the latest iteration on Amazon for about 20 bucks more and man what a great decision that was! First off, I love love LOVE how the charging case for these earbuds can be charged with USB-C or wireless charging. I find myself at a loss and often scratching my head when I have to charge a device up with a dated micro-USB cable (like you have to do with the first gen version). But the greatness doesn't stop there, I love the fact that you can use a single ear bud with either the left or right ear. Honestly, I never thought I'd find myself using it in this mode too often, but it really is convenient for me when I work at the warehouse packing orders and listening to podcasts. Plus, when I run out of juice in one ear, I'll just swap to the other while the first one charges! LOVE IT! I haven't really timed how long these things actually last in between charges since I haven't had the need to have them on for more than a few hours at a time, but I will say that I'm very satisfied with it so far. The sound quality is pretty decent for what these are. Yes, you don't get the heavy bass like you would with bigger headphones, but let's be real, would you get those same bass gains on say Apple ear buds? (doubt it!) Would I recommend this product? Absolutely!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-04,"Seemed promising, but...","I got these headphones, as I was looking for something wireless while commuting and working out. The sound quality is a great improvement over my former headphones. However, I've been disappointed in the product. Though it's supposed to wirelessly connect, the headphones don't when they turn on. I always have to manually connect them and even then, I can't seem to get an immediate pairing. The biggest issue for me is the lack of microphone functionality. If I try to use these headphones on a phone call, the person on the other side can't hear what I'm saying. It's always super erratic. It's been an issue with every call I've had, regardless of cellular service and connection to WiFi. I had high hopes for these headphones, but I'm disappointed and wished I had saved the money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-04,Great product! Great pricepoint,So great. Love 'em.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,0,2020-03-05,"Sound good, but total PITA to connect","This is my third pair of Soundcore Liberty Air (original and Gen 2) and they all suffer from the same engineering flaw: Almost impossible to pair easily. The problem is they want to pair as singles (left or right, mono) not as a pair. If you go online, you'll see dozens of people making this complaint. Essentially, you have to do multiple resets, cross your fingers, and hope for the best. To make it worse, once you get them to correctly paired with one phone, you'll have to go through the same ordeal to pair them again with another phone. Anker has a reputation for making good products, but they screwed the pooch with the Soundcore Liberty Airs. They sound really good with some of the best bass I've heard in earpods, but the hassle of connecting is not worth it. Come on Anker, it's 2020, why can't you get something so fundamental right? Take a pass on these, and look elsewhere."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-05,The wouldnt stay in my ears,"I wanted to love these so badly. I cant knock the sound quality etc. They sound GREAT!! But these things just wouldn't stay in my ears at all. I tried all of the supplied ear tips but nuthn. I mean every time i tuned my head, yawned, ate anything, they would just fall out. I've never had problems in the past. But these were my first earphones in this style. Guess Ill keep looking."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-07,Perfect for everyday,"Purchased for my wife's airpods replacement. They are bigger than airpods but she loves them and can't ""believe how clear the sound is"". Highly recommend."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-07,Excellent,"Fantastic quality, sound, and call quality"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-07,"I love them, but fall out of ears easily, have to repair, when using another device","sound is way to low, and does not adjust, app setup needs severe improvement"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-07,Good sound quality and comfort,Really good sound quality. Light weight and very comfortable in the ear. Haven’t had long enough to comment on battery life.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-09,Amazing personalized sound!,"Love everything about these ear buds. Battery life is amazing, as well as the sound. Fine tuning the sound to your personal hearing has been great for my husband who has trouble with some sounds. I also feel that the price is more reasonable than many comparable products."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-11,my experience with liberty air 2 so far.,"so i bought these earbuds like 2 weeks ago and they got delivered in only 2 days. Everything was looking just great until I tried using the app... when I tried to connect the earbuds to the app a message popped up saying I needed to update my earbuds. and I didn’t care I thought it was cool that Anker is still updating their earbuds once in a while. The problem begins when the update was around 73% when another message popped up “an error occurred please try again. So I tried to update them again, but it was all useless I couldn’t update the earbuds and I tried everything from using another phone to try and update them to reseting the earbuds. But it was all in vane. ( And In case you don’t know if the earbuds are not up to date they won’t let you use the app) so I contacted Anker and told them about my problem, they have a very good costumer service that helped me get a new replacement, I currently have my new Anker liberty air 2 and these are working great and sound amazing would totally buy again."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-11,"Great Price, great sound, comfortable, long lasting battery","Product is a little annoying to setup initially, but works like a charm after. Just gotta follow the instructions. Only recharged them once since I bought them. I’d like more bass and wish they were a tad smaller, but that’s my only complaint. Rarely fall out of my ears. Great purchase for the price!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-12,Great earbuds,Had trouble getting them both to pair out of the box but I did a little research and found out how to completely reset them. That fixed the issue and theyve been wonderful since!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-13,Despite getting a defective set I will purchase again.,The sound quality is great. Great for calls in week one. By week two I kept getting asked WHAT is that?! There was some sort of screeching feedback that I never heard but callers could hear throughout the call. I will try another set and hope for the best.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-14,Wish they had worked out.,"Returned , wouldn't fully connect or stay connected to device."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-19,It varies from individuals. I give away mine because it kept on falling off.,It's not for people with small ears. And it does pickup noise from the background or get disconnected in a middle of a conversation.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-19,It's a quality product,Fantastic product I like the fit and the sound quality
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-19,Were is all that bass coming from?,"The sound quality is amazing, I could not contain my stupid grin when I first put them on. The bass isn’t what you get from an actual sub, where you can physically feel the bass on your entire body, but these buds have some nice bass non the less. You can swap from left or right, no problem, but when you first get them you may be thrown off by the “auto pause” feature. The moment you pull a bud out of your ear it will automatically pause whatever you’re playing, making you think that you can’t swap. I like the auto pause feature when I’m in line at the grocery store, as soon as I’m up to the register, I’ll pull out one bud and I can speak to the cashier without the other bud that’s still in my ear playing. To turn off the auto pause feature, just use the app, and it’s the last tab on settings. Turning off the auto pause will Now your music will play uninterrupted no matter what bud you switch to. I did notice a spit second signal drop when switching earbuds while connected to my MacBook Pro. The same slight signal drop didn’t happen on my iPhone or Android phones though, swapping earbuds was seamless. I love that when an earbud’s battery runs low, dropping it into the case for ten minutes gives you two hours of play time. I go the entire day of playing music or audio books and most of the time it’s with both ears buds in. These things do cut off external noise, so it’s extremely dangerous and stupid to have both earbuds in while you’re out and about, driving, so please don’t. The sound quality is impeccable, I’ve never had anyone notice that I’m speaking to them on wireless earbuds, and yes, you can use the phone on either earbud. The only thing that I hate is the way to adjust the volume is from your device or program touches. I have my volume set to + when I double tap on the right and - when I double tap on the left. Long pressing on one for pause, and skip on the other. I usually just take out my phone to adjust the volume because no matter how you set the volume, it only adjusts the volume one increment per touch. You can program your touch choices through the app.
You can only choose 2 feature per earbud when long pressing and double tap, from pause, play, skip, volume up, volume down or answer a call. The earbuds come with an adornment of ear size pieces. Providing you find the right size ear piece for you, these things aren’t going anywhere once they’re locked in place. You can run, workout, and even sweat, these babies are locked in place. You will know when the earbuds are locked in place when most external sounds go away, and you kinda feel a slight suction. Sorry for the long post, but I’m happy with my purchase, I’m getting a few more to give out as gifts. Thank you."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-03-21,Great Service,I had an issue with my original Liberty Airs. I submitted for a warranty and asked Anker support if I could upgrade to Liberty Air 2s. They graciously allowed me to do that with payment of the price difference. The Liberty Air 2s are great value for the money.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-22,"Good, but has an annoying bug","I had the first generation and lost them after a year, so I decided to buy these. I've owned two pairs of this generation and they both have the same problem. If my phone was connected to a different device, say my speaker, and then I try to connect to the headphones, it won't work. I have to restart my phone, that's the only solution I've found. Battery life and single bud pairing is great, but that technical issue really gets in the way."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-23,Good Earbuds. Great Customer Service!,"Bought these earbuds for my daughter. The pair we initially received had a small stain on the charging case. After contacting customer service, the customer service representative (Michelle) arranged for a replacement set and a way for me to return the stained item. The process was very easy and my daughter is very pleased with the earbuds. I have listened to them also and found them to have good quality sound and acceptable noise cancellation. I also ended up ordering another pair of Anker earbuds (Soundcore Life P2) for my other daughter because of the good experience with these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,0,2020-03-25,"Comfortable, clear and extraordinary charge life","I am so impressed by these earbuds. First - Fantastic design, from the buds themselves to the charging container. Second - they are VERY comfortable, they insert easily and stays put. Very easy to use, it linked immediately with my iPhone X. They have great sound quality for listening to music and making phone calls. I'm also impressed with the battery, the charge last for 6 or more hours of use. All in all I am truly impressed and a much better alternative than the ""official"" earbuds for iPhones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-26,okay upgrade,"I have the soundcore liberty air 1 , life p2 and now these. While the liberty air 2 have longer battery life i am getting static noise in the new headphones Not sure if this is caused by the sound cancelling or interference."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-26,These Headphones Kick Serious Butt for Music...,"Anker is an AWESOME company that manufactures AWESOME products. And these fit the bill. Easy setup fantastic fit, great case, I have ZERO complaints when listening to music. That said, the 'background' noise cancellation that callers hear when you are on a call leave a lot to be desired. If you are in quiet environment - no issues! However, I purchased these earbuds specifically for phone calls. I working in an incredibly noisy environment and these did not perform to my expectations. I have to admit, these are the 4th pair of earbuds I have purchased that did not work in my specific situation. I may never find the perfect earbuds that I will need unless I opt for a bulky over-the-ear set from another company (which I refused to do). I think I will have to just opt for a wired headset for the foreseeable future :("
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-03-28,Best for the price..!,Nice one by anker is the 2nd one in the family..!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-28,Most convoluted setup I've ever seen,"I can't imagine who designed these things. The fit is great, sound is just decent, but the setup and use is so overly complicated. Maybe I'm just used to the Apple ones - a few taps, etc. but these are tap once for option a, tap 3 times for option b, hold 8 seconds on the left one for option c, etc. Too much hassle - and they don't really work as a 'pair' like you'd expect."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-03-29,One earbud for the price of two!,"So if you were in the market for some earbuds the absolutely will not stay connected, and sometimes, if you’re lucky the left one will work. These are for you. However, if you’re looking for something that simple to and easy to use, like opening up the pack putting the air buds in and having them play music, do not buy this product, this cannot deliver.

However, if you’re looking for something that’s simple to an easy to use, like opening up the pack putting the earbuds in and having them play music, do not buy this product, this cannot deliver. I do want to add, that When I purchase these earbuds, unlike AirPods, there’s one connection for both earbuds and one for the left only. I thought that was strange. Then I learned why this was the case. The right earbud rarely maybe 50% of the time, will stay connected. 90% of the time you’ll at least have the left earbud connected which is why they have a notation for sound liberty air 2 and sound liberty air two -L.
I would get another set of AirPods, but they have a short life, mine totally died after 14 months and Apple told me to pound sand. So I guess I’ll get a replacement for these crapoI would get another set of AirPods, but they have a short life, mine totally died after 14 months and Apple told me to pound sand. So I guess LOL get a replacement for these crap Ola anchor liberty air buds. And then I’ll write back again when the replacement set comes in, because maybe they will be better than this original crapola set. Update
I just got the replacement pair from anchor, and guess what? It is the same crap! They only play out of one earbud! So, my advice remains the same do not buy these they are really really crappy! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-03-30,Difficult to get both buds working together,Took several hours to get sound out of each ear bud. Instructions not very clear. Needed a third-party YouTube explanation to get the buds working correctly. I liked the final product but it was a struggle to achieve.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-03-31,"Best for conf calls, not sports","Not perfect fit, fall out all the time. Tried to replace the soft part with smaller ones, better now but still not ok. Jogging with them is out of question. Otherwise, clear sound and good noice cancellation. Recommend for calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-04,Great Running Earbuds,Great for working out in.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-06,Outstanding Customer Service,"I bought this specifically for the call quality that it advertised and when it came only one of the earbuds worked. I was frustrated but I called the customer support and once we figured out the problem, I got told that a replacement product shipped to me for free! That call took only a few minutes and they told me it would take 7-10 days to ship my replacement. It arrived at my house two days after I made the call. Calls are very clear on these and people don't seem to have trouble hearing me at all. The Hear ID is a really cool feature that you can customize the EQ settings to your specific ear structure. Very simple and easy to use! I am thoroughly impressed with the customer service and will definitely purchase from Anker again."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-09,Not worth trying,Unpredictable at best is the only way to describe how these work. The touch features do not function well and forget about using them for working out.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-11,WORTH THE MONEY 110%,"The earbuds are awesome! The battery life is so good, you almost never have to worry about these running out of battery. The sound quality and the base of these ""In Ear"" headphones are some of the best I've heard (That including the Powerbeats wireless that I still currently own). In terms of durability, I haven't really tested them...a couple of drops and falls and they are still working great. The noise cancellation seems fine, if the are just sitting in your ears with no volume obviously you can still somewhat hear what's going on around you. However once the music/ video is playing I couldn't hear anything other than the audio playing through the earbuds. Call quality and clarity in both noisy and quiet areas is as good as it gets. And finally the last feature is the Soundcore App with the HearID that I encourage to download. This makes the earbuds fine tune to your hearing needs, making the audio experience a world better IMO. Bottom line these are the BEST earbuds at this price and I would even say better than most of the wireless earbuds from the $100-$200price range. CAN'T GO WRONG! ENJOY!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-11,"Buyer beware, unstable pairing and sync issues.","Terrible product experience. Minimal documentation in the box. Right earbud would pair but not left. Reseated them both in the case, disabled Bluetooth and reset both per instructions on Anker website. They paired but they would not connect to the soundcore app. This is critical for firmware updates and eq settings. Disabled Bluetooth and went through the reset process again. After 10 tries the left earbud will still not pair. Seems to be a very common experience and I have no patience for a product that's this finicky with a solution that amounts to a reboot as the fix. I'll be looking elsewhere for tws earbuds. Very disappointed with Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,3,1,2020-04-14,Troubleshooting... try this,"I'm mainly writing this to maybe help those that have the issue where audio only comes out of one earbud. I didn't google this, I just stumbled upon it on my own. The key, for me anyway, to have audio from both earbuds was to pair the earbuds without removing them from the case. I left them in the case, opened the case and paired them to my phone. Once that was done I took them out and tried them on and I finally had audio through both of them. I'm hoping this will help those who have had the same issue. Once I've had more time with them I will try to update my review. For now I'm giving them 3 stars because of the headache that was trying to get them to work together."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-14,I think mine were previously used,"UPDATE:
I'm now having connection issues. For some reason, only the left earbud will connect with my phone. I have reset the earbuds multiple times. Re-paring does not seem to fix the problem. It seems to happen about 1 out of every 5 times I use the buds. Also, the touch sensors are extremely finicky. Sometimes they register perfectly, other times nothing happens. ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I just got mine in today, and I have a feeling that they are refurbs. The sticker holding the box closed was clearly pulled up and then poorly replaced. One of the ear buds were not in the placeholder in the packaging. The plastic film/sticker was already removed on one of the ear buds and the carrying case. Just started doing some audio tests, and the bass ""crackles"" at times. Going to test a bit longer, hoping this will get better. I got my wife a set of the Life P2's, and she loves hers. I know Anker is a good brand, but maybe there are some QA issues?"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-15,Great Purchase!,I use these earbuds on a daily basis for working out and wearing while outside doing lawn work and walking. The noise cancelling is good and the sound quality is great. I love that they pair automatically with whatever device I'm using at the time - I go from my Peloton Bike to my Phone and they work seamlessly on my iPhone 11. I can use them several hours a day and still only charge them every few days. I also like that you can customize the settings for the modes on the earbuds themselves! Genius! They also stay in place SUPER well! I loved them so much that I bought my husband a pair!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-17,A nice update to the OG Liberty Air,"I bought these with my tax return $$$ to go with an iPad. I have the first generation of these earbuds too and wow these are kind of everything I want in a pair. The sound quality is good, not great as would be the case in any pair of true wireless earbuds in this price range. The mics are excellent for making phone calls and rejecting background noise for the person who is hearing you. The reason these are better than the first ones- USB C and wireless charging with a charging pad or stand, they have more magnets inside the case holding the earbuds in, a sensor that automatically pauses when you take them out of your ear but NOT when you put them back in. They also have an app that lets you update the firmware, change the tap and long press functions, and change the EQ settings to different profiles or even allow for a custom one. I really do think they packed a lot into them to price them at $100. Obviously, you can spend half of that and still get an OKish pair of wireless earbuds. So if none of those features are important to you, the original Liberty Air are still pretty good for $80 but usually you can find them for $60 with an amazon coupon. I really think these are probably better than the second gen AirPods and are a significant amount cheaper. However if you are Apple only user, and you don’t won’t the hassle of connecting with Bluetooth across multiple devices and you don’t care about the extra $30-$40, then maybe you would be better off with AirPods. Almost no earbuds have the Find My functionality that lets you see their location on a map except for those."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-19,Great Value for the Price!,"Bought these buds as I have been in the market for something wireless. After using for 2 weeks I can say these really do provide a great value for the price. Anker makes great products and these are just as expected. Nice that multiple silicone pieces are provided for the best ear fit. While these do not have active noise cancelling, with the right fit they keep out about 80 to 90% of ""Outside"" noise above 50% volume. One thing you really NEED to do upon first usage is down load the Soundcore app and update the firmware. Upon doing this I have not experienced any of the pairing issues for the left bud other users have, not once even using across multiple laptops, my phone and tablet. UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE! Comfort is great, can wear for hours at a time will little to no ear discomfort. Again, using the proper fitting ear piece these do not fall out. Battery life thus far has not been an issue. While I have not tried to get the full 7 hrs in one play yet, I have been using for 2-4 hrs at a time with no issue. Drop them back into the case and they are back to full in no time at all. Speaking of the case, in the 2 weeks I have used I have only charged the case twice. Once upon receiving for the first full charge, and a couple days ago to top off again. Even after a week's worth of usage the case was only down to around 50 to 60%. Case supports wireless QI charging and it works well. Also has USB C on the bottom and that works as intended also. Sound quality is really good, not disappointed at all. The bass is great, while these do not produce that ""Subwoffer"" super deep bass like you hear in cars that rattle as they drive by the bass IS pronounced. These handled 90s-2000s Rap quite well. Mids and Highs are clean and crisp even at max volume. Vocals have no distortion as well. In general I would say these are not totally Ear monitor quality like you would see being used during a live performance, for the price you won't find yourself complaining. Call quality is clean and crisp, no issues. While not the main reason I purchased these, if needing to make / answer a call while wearing I do not expect any issue. Touch controls do require a bit of time to get the hang of. You need to hit right on the middle of the bud to get the proper response, but after 3 to 5 tries I got the hang of it pretty quickly. The ""Touch"" does not have to be all that hard, you do not need to pound them or jam them into your ear to get a response, just a nice little double tap (or long hold) depending on what action you are wanting. It is nice that the Soundcore app allows you to remap the touch controls. You can change how each bud responds to taps. While the commands are limited to a few options, Next track, Previous track, Pause, Volume up / down and Google / Siri assistant, these are pretty much all I need anyway. While I did mention briefly the charging case a few more things to discuss. I purchased the White buds, and as such the case is a bit of an off white with a bit of an eggshell / grey fleck type finish. Why I mention this is because I expect the case to get dirty / show dirt since it is quite a light color. While not slick per se, it does move around a lot in pockets, and I imagine would slide around quite a lot in a purse or bag. It is what I consider to be on the small side, which is fine but I would consider it to be something you could loose quite easily. For that reason I did purchase a case cover also from Amazon from the following link: https://www.amazon.com/TOLUOHU-Soundcore-Shockproof-Protective-Compatible/dp/B085FYR3L4/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=liberty+air+2+case&qid=1587332254&sr=8-3 The case fits snug, still allows for wireless charging while on, and has a cut out at the bottom to allow USB C charging as well. My favorite feature for the case is the key chain clip, as this allows me to clip to my pants / shorts / bag or keychain and have a high level of confidence the case more secure then just being in my pocket. I purchased the red color, just because it is bright and should help me not just leave it laying around carelessly. One thing to really stress with the Soundcore app, is beside the ability remap the touch controls and update firmware as needed the best feature the app provides is the personal tuning feature. Simply, it is kind of like the old school hearing test with tones. Make sure you are in a room with little to no noise and proceed. The app will emit tones first in one bud all the way through the frequency spectrum. Follow the onscreen instruction as you go, very simple. Upon completing the testing the app will create a customized EQ setting for your own personal hearing ability, and it IS quite better then the default EQ setting. Amazing feature. Closing out I would say if you are looking for a really good value you cannot go wrong with these buds. Keep in mind these will not be on the same level as Professional grade buds but for less then $100 you really can't go wrong."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-20,Love them! Don’t overlook Soundcore App!,"First thought: I was ready to request a replacement because there was a terrible static and popping every so often, especially in the left earbud, but I decided to go to the website and read the manual. I had read several reviews but had somehow overlooked the Soundcore App. This is a MUST have. First thing I did was unpair and then repair after installing the app. As soon as I selected my device in the app it said there was a firmware update to fix bugs. This was super easy to do and only took a few minutes, and now there is no pop or crackle. I set up the personalized Hear Id sound settings and they sound BEAUTIFUL! I love that I can personalize some of the settings to my preferences. My only complaint would be that instructions/packaging should say download the app and connect from there before using, like red card, stop sign, sticker on the case style. This is such an important feature to really get the best product impression and effective use."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-20,Excellent value,Nice really like them great value
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,1,2020-04-21,connectivity,I bought these to use at work on zoom meetings during the current work from home. They worked well for a couple days but now the microphone keeps dropping and won't stay connected
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-22,Buy these!,I absolutely love these earbuds. This is the fourth pair I’ve purchased of wireless headphones trying to get the right fit and microphone. I refuse to spend $250-300 on Apple AirPods and feel that these are probably just as good if not better since you’re paying less. I love all the Anker products I’ve purchased and would highly recommend these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-22,"Clear, accurate audio; comfortable fit; highly recommend","I give Anker's Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds a 5-star even though I predict the next iteration that I predict will be another winner. Anker designs and makes high quality products, whether a power adapter or a cable or earbuds. I tried a number of other highly touted earbuds before settling on the Liberty Air 2. None had the pristine accuracy of audio reproduction or the comfortable fit... none. Without naming competitors, just let me say that the Liberty Air 2 earbuds will beat others costing twice or three times as much."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-23,Awesome product,They sound great battery last long
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-25,DO NOT BUY THESE,"These are AWFUL. They're impossible to connect. If I EVER connect to a different device, I have to reset them multiple times, and now, the left one had just stopped working. Complete waste of money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-04-25,Look Elsewhere!,"Thus is one of the most disappointing pieces of technology I've purchased! I've had the Neo's for a while and love them. These are garbage; latest drivers, continual connectivity problems with at least four different Samsung and two LG devices."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-27,Great sound!,I’m using the Air Liberty 2 for music and to study on quizlet on my phone. Don’t know how long the battery last yet from using because I just got them yesterday. I downloaded the app to customize my hearing ID for myself. I did have trouble when I first tried to use these because I couldn’t get both earbuds to work in sync ( at the same time ); But then I just watched a YouTube video and also used the app for this product and then I finally got it to work. I’m truly enjoying these ear buds so far. My stepson got them from a family member last Christmas and he still likes them so I figured I’d give them a shot. He also said he likes these ear buds better than apples air pods.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-04-28,"First pair were a bust, Second pair is great","The first pair that arrived worked for about a month before having connection problems and charging problems. Returning and getting a new pair was quick and easy. The new ones work great, going on 4-5 months now with no problems. Call quality and battery life is quite good, which is what was needed when purchasing this product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,0,2020-04-28,Fantastic product!,"This is a great pair a earbuds. The sound quality is nice, however, I wouldn't say they are noise cancelling. They do come with a sheet of multiple sized pads so you can customize the fit. I have smaller ear canal openings and I do have trouble keeping these snug in place. Definitely read the instructions on how to properly use the controls. The issue I have is that I have to work some magic, and even then it's rare, in order to get both buds working at the same time. Usually, I can only get one, and it's only if the other earbud is in the case. The battery life is great on these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-04-27,The Earbuds you are looking for,"Disclaimer: I am a veteran cheap headphone user. I am a junkie for 5Below crappy headphones because I have brain damage when it comes to spending real money on headphones which I am probaly going to drop in a puddle while walking the dog, or lose them in an airport. The most expensive headphones I have ever bought for myself prior to these were a set of Insignia ""noise cancelling"" buds on the heavy yoke. So what I am not is a very nuanced audiophile who wants the best experience after extensively customizing the various equalizers in my phone or in the headset's settings. So I bought a pair of knock-off i9 ear buds (they look like the Apple branded buds, but...) for $30, and (if you are a veteran user, you can guess this part) I could not get the left earbud to connect. It was quite annoying because the right earbud had good sound quality and even a decent mic for phone calls and video chat. It was just going to be an eternal mono device. After a lot of soul-searching and bingewatcing of Unbox Therapy videos, I scraped together $100 and ordered these Anker ear buds. I have to admit: the only thing I do not love about these earbuds is that there's no way to make them ""ping"" when I set them down someplace and can't find them. Note to Anker - your app could be able to make my case ping so I can find it when I put it down on my work desk or in the kitchen rather than on my night stand. You might be sketical about the Soundcore app. Do not be skeptical. Use the app to set up your headset. It's not a mind-blowing difference, but it is a significant difference for listening enjoyment. It is also great for troubleshooting the headset when it doesn't seem to want to behave the right way. $99 is a lot of money for a lot of people. If you have $99 and you want a very good experience with completely-wireless ear buds, make this choice."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,2,0,2020-03-04,You can't turn off voice control!,"The headphones sound pretty good. On occasion I will only hear out of one ear, but they're easy to reset. Another issue I ran into once is that they continued to beep for a few minutes and then completely turn off, even though they had full battery. That only happened one time and a reset helped. The worst feature is that I cannot turn off the voice control function. So, whenever I accidentally tape the ear phone, it starts the voice control and will even start calling someone that I haven't talked to in years because it picked up on background noise in the office and thought that it heard to call someone... It's pretty embarrassing. In the meantime, I'll be looking for a different set of earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,4,1,2020-02-10,Game changer earbuds,"I have tried many (if not all) leading wireless earphones over the years. Each of them has quirks, shortcomings and challenges. The liberty air 2 earbuds are as close to perfect as I have found. The battery life is so strong that I don't ever have to worry about charging. I charge the case when I think about it but after daily use for the past 3 weeks I have never had an issue with battery. The quality is clear. The ability to listen/hear through either ear is fantastic. The fit is very snug and rarely needs to be reset. Highly recommended!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,5,1,2020-02-06,Good for the money,Pretty good for the money that they cost. The case has a nice stone color look to them. But they are not white even though they may look like it. 1.The battery is spot on for me at least both with the buds them self and the case. 2.bass is deacent for them being small
Anker,Soundcore Liberty Air 2,1,1,2020-01-14,Not worth the hassle,"This product does not earn even 1 star. Tried 2 different sets, updated firmware, reset several times would not sync. You should be able to open box sync with phone and just work."
