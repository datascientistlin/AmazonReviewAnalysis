EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-01,amazing sound quality!,"Sound quality is awesome! This buds have an amazing sound quality, for 49 bucks, it is a steal! You can’t go wrong with these, the only con. It’s the case it feels cheap and weak but other then that you are good to go."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-02,Found the one,"Love the usb-c, fit (quite impressed, coming from Anker Neo), buds design, case design, and thank you thank you for usb-c! Been using two weeks now and battery life has been excellent and within advertised duration"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-04,Excellent wireless earbuds,"Packaged well and in a little charging and storage box which has magnets to further hold the earbuds in place. The box is compact and a perfect size for pockets or bag storage while out and about with you. The ear buds themselves also feel very solid and well made. The sound is fantastic and they were really easy to use, they paired with my phone immediately."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-04,Great for people who need a good fit and great Bass!,"I just received these buds yesterday and am very pleased with the punchy bass and high volume provided. I'm pretty picky with audio and these don't disappoint. I compared these to the Galaxy Buds by Samsung (of which i'm a fanboy) and these provide superior sound quality (especially the lows as i mentioned before)
Pros:
Great sound, Battery life, wireless charging, USB-C, amazing fit. Noise cancellation, waterproof ( Though i haven't tested this yet.) sturdy build, and the price was amazing for what I received. Cons:
Charging case is a little larger than I prefer, but its size is justified because of how much batter it contains. So far the case is the only con I've found. The only other thing i could think of would be the high end vocal could be slightly clearer. It does have a slightly muddy sound, but this can be tweaked in the sound setting of many phones. P.S. If you have really small ears the fit might stick out of your ear a little bit. my girlfriend looks a little goofy with these in her ear, but she is 5ft tall and very petite. All together you can't go wrong with purchasing these buds!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-07-05,Very lightweight and comfortable.,"These are amazing for music, even better than my $150 pair of earbuds. They work well with Siri and the button in each earbud is very easy and soft to touch. They fit perfectly in my ear and are very light. Lots of positive to say about these buds, however during phone calls people hear me very low which is the reason I gave it 4 stars. If you don’t use them much to talk on the phone these earbuds are perfect and have become my default pair to enjoy music and podcasts. It is also water proof and I shower with them to not interrupt my podcast."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-06,Amazing sound at a good price,"The EarFun earbuds are ultra-simple to use and the sound quality is about as perfect as I have ever heard. The bass is so much better and overall clarity of sounds. The earbuds also have a cool, sleek design while maintaining a strong but lightweight build, they fit perfectly in the ear and don't fall off, I ran a few times while putting them on, and they didn't move a bit or fall. I paired headphones with my iphone and android devices without any issue. It has really good wireless range. I can easily listen to music while working in garden and phone being in house. Overall, I'm more than happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of bluetooth earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-06,"It cancels out, outside noise","I like the sound quality and how it cancels out, outside noise. I use it to workout and watch my tv shows."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-07-06,This is an affordable and nice looking ear buds.,"Hi,This is an affordable and nice looking ear buds. Comes with chargeable case. I try to compare it to Samsung and Apple Brand product ,it is way cheaper than those big brand.I was listening music for few days and sound quality is good. Battery stays for few days. Easy pairing process.The one con is, it's bigger than those big brand products. But you save tons of money.so.I have no complaint on it.Thanks"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-13,Good stuff,"Nice earbuds. Clear and good bass . Sound over microphone is also very clear. Nice case , easy to pullout , usb type c . Must have"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-17,Great sound quality,These sound fantastic. 3rd set of wireless headphones I've tried and these are the first to fully answer the mail.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-19,Great Sound,Awesome sound and function works great in wet environment totally worth the price compete with $199 pairs
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-19,Making Life More Fun & They donate to UNICEF,"The EarFun earbuds arrived and they are easy to use - set up and I don't mind how they feel. Sound quality is great for music - feels like I'm at a silent disco. Haven't tried to make a call yet. The only thing is I currently have no way to charge them bc you need a type C-USB cord or wireless charger, but I'm about to buy one. They donate a $1 for every review to UNICEF so hopefully UNICEF gets a $1 for this very honest review."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-22,They are magnetic for the case.Good feature.,Good sound . Easy to use.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-22,"Great sound, very comfortable",I have been trying out the earbuds for a week and I'm super impressed—by far the best sound I've heard from any wireless buds and better than many wired ones I've had. Glad I didn't spend multiple hundreds for another brand!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-24,No complaints so far,"For my sound quality standards the sound is perfect, bought it on prime day for 40 bucks and they are amazing, very easy to pair, good fit in my ears, no risk of falling during jogging, good distance between my phone or my galaxy watch, good battery life, wireless charging case and usb C, water proof, included mic and music control. Price is also great, can't complain about anything."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-29,Great quality especially at that price.,For the price these earbuds exceeded my expectations. The in case charging is such a plus. The sound quality and charging time alone is very much worth the money.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-30,Great earbuds!,"I am very surprised with the sound quality. Even without using any equalizer they sound great. It would be better to have more volume reserve, when using them with a phone I must increase volume to 100% to hear everything well."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-30,Wireless earbuds,Están cómodos. Se escucha muy vien la musica
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-07-31,"Wonderful product, easy to use and looks great.","Better than I expected! After using it for a few days. Below are my experience:
- Fit: With the middle size, the fit is very good, providing a very good sound isolation effect. The earbuds fit very well into my ears, never fall out while I shake my head. - Connectivity: Love the fast connection to the phone. It connected instantly the moment you take out the right earphone from the casing. I guess that’s the wonder of Bluetooth 5.0. Left earphone connected well. I usually wear the right ear first before taking out the left earphone, and so far no issue at all. - Volume: very good volume, as the noise isolation is so good, the volume produced is more than enough. - Sound Quality: The sound was awesome for me. The isolation when you wear both the earphone makes the sound clearer. - Microphone: The mic works also well. I gave several calls to my friends with the earbuds, and we can hear each other clearly. - Latency: The latency is also very minimal that I can barely notice sync issues when watching videos in YouTube, Netflix or movies using the built in media player of my phone. - Battery Life: The battery life was awesome! I can use it up to 4 days without charging the casing (usage day by day for this). Charging was fast. This was based on charging via cable. I don’t have wireless charger, hence can’t comment on it. - Waterproof: Tried to shower with it 3 times and so far no issue. So it’s indeed waterproof. Cons:
- The push buttons are not very useful. Maybe touch control would be much better for me. But that is very personal. For this price, it is really an awesome earphone. Overall, I’m really satisfied with the earphone. The earbuds are surely worth their price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-01,Long lasting earbuds,The left earbud is a quieter than the right side. Others say I seem far away when using for phone calls. Battery life is amazing. Great for listening to music. They also stay in place just fine. Over all I feel it is a great buy.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-01,Wonderful earphones for a great price!,"After testing them for a week I can confidently say that these earphones are great. Solid bass and full sound, I'd especially recommend them if you enjoy a full bass sound. If you prefer a lighter bass, that can always be managed with sound settings, and it still sounds great. Very good sound isolation as well. The battery life is great, especially with the case. The fit is very comfortable, doesn't hurt the ears after prolonged wear. It pairs very quickly and easily too, and I haven't had any connectivity issues. The earphones themselves are very light too which adds to the comfort. These earphones will get you a long way and it's amazing quality for the price!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-02,Has good quality sound and comfortable wear!,"This ear buds has quality sound, comfortable wear for long time, the draw back is sometimes is hard pairing the other ear bud."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-03,Here the music,"I purchased these for my husband to wear under his helmet while he us riding his motorcycle. He said that he can hear most of the radio stations really well. He can also hear his phone call pretty well. There's an occasional interference but that maybe his signal. Also, sometimes the volume for the stations are not clear. For the money we would recommend them."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-03,They don't fall out while running,Bought these during Prime Day. Excellent workout headphones to use while running and swimming. Charge lasts a long time.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-07,"Everything is good, except the earbuds keep connect back to the phone after disconnect.","After few days of the ownership, this is my feedback, the earbuds is good, the fit, the sound, the distance between the earbuds and the phone before disconnect, the battery life. So far the only complain is the auto connection through the Bluetooth. Yes, it did connect fast when I pull the earbuds out of the case, and yes, it did disconnect when I put the earbuds back to the case to recharge or store. But the earbuds keeping connected back to the phone even both are in the case, and after few manual disconnect the Bluetooth device…isn’t is supposed to be keep disconnect until you pull the earbuds out of the case? Everything else about the earbuds is really good!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-09,Always ready to use!,"If you like having your wireless earbuds always charged and ready for use, then this is it! Decent sound, waterproof, great fit and excellent value makes these perfect for the gym. I’m able to workout, hit the sauna and hot tub, and shower as they continue to function. Just don’t forget to wash your ears....."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-09,Excellent ear phones.,Great sound and volume.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-11,good,"Very good quality! The earbuds are just perfect, The receiving signal of Bluetooth is very stable, pairing was very easy. The size is just right, it comes with three different ear adapters, fit in the ear very well, super light and comfortable to wear. The long battery life makes these Bluetooth headphones the perfect companion. The sound is amazing. The additional highlight is the wireless charging, it is very easy for me to charge the case with my wireless charger. Exactly what I wanted."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-12,Love them.,"Ergonomic, great sound, long battery life."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-13,Satisfied with the earbuds.,"They are my first pair of wireless earbuds, making answering the phone calls and listening to music so much fun and convenient! I especially like their good sound quality and super handsome design. Thanks!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-13,Low volume and the person on the other line cant hear me,Only had them for a week but I liked the bluetooth connection real fast sound quality great my dislike is when I make a call the person on the other line cant hear or understand what I'm talking about also the volume is really low....I have a note 9 flagship phone and i cant hear the music at all cause how low it is....
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-14,Great Job on Inexpensive Bluetooth Earbuds!,"I’ve been using these Bluetooth earbuds for a few weeks now and I LOVE the convenience of having earbuds that hold a rather long charge with a portable charger that holds an ADDITIONAL charge that lasts me days longer! The convenience of being able to keep using my earbuds without needing to find a charging port every six hours or so is so much better than any other wireless device that I own. The only issue I have is typical to almost wireless earbuds: when the charge gets low, the signal starts to cut out and music / voice calls tend to cut out indiscriminately. Otherwise, the sound / voice quality seems to be extremely good (it is from my side, and I have no complaints from the opposite side of a call, even when my windows are down while I’m driving). Great job on an inexpensive product that actually works and looks better than other Bluetooth earbuds!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-14,Really Enjoying These,"What I like most about them is their git. They feel good in the ears. They sound great as well, especially because they seal well so you get all the sound that you're supposed to hear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-16,great sound,"Ok these sound great and look great, and being water proof is is a plus, they paired with my phone quickly, just one click, i'm impressed. they charge in the case either wireless on a charging pad or with the provided cord, the fit was perfect for me right out of the box but they come with 3 sizes ear pieces S,M,L. they are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-16,Overall fantastic earbuds with a few minor grivences.,"Pros
- Price
- design
- Sound Quality
Cons
- Case construction
- Eartips are shallow
- lack of practicality (in my opinion)
Watch my video for more depth"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-16,"Great mic, great audio quality, if you like the fit.","There's a lot to like about these, if you like the way they fit in the ear. Pros:
- Excellent audio playback quality. A bit bass heavy for my taste but by no means a deal breaker. - Very good microphone. Not the best in my testing, but in the top tier. - Excellent charging compatibility. Took a charge from the USB-C to USB-C fast charger I use to charge my Pixel 3. Also worked with Qi wireless charging. Many of the other USB-C ear buds I tried only worked with 1A USB-A to USB-C chargers. Cons:
- These stay in your ears by the friction of the rubber seal that you insert into your ear canal. I prefer the kind that rest in your ear opening and stay in place with gravity. Personal preference, of course."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-17,"Questionable water proof, superb customer care.","I edited my review and rating (from ONE star to FOUR stars), my initial feedback is below the line, here is the added bit and why I jumped to 4 stars: Customer care was following up with me on the issue and were very keen about understanding/fixing it. I am certain that they will take it seriously and will stand behind their product. ————
Bought two of these, after ONE day of usage the right bud’s volume went down in one of them, contacted customer services, tried their suggested solutions, didn’t work, returned it, the following day the same problem happened with the other pair, ao I returned it too."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-17,Works perfect!!,The headphone buds work perfect for me. The sound quality is great and the battery lasts a few days with daily use. It connects to phone easy and fits in ear perfect!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-17,Surprisingly good!,These are a steal for the price. They exceed the expectations that I had for them. Great purchase!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-18,THIS is what wireless earbuds should be!,"Let me preface this by saying this is the fourth pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones I've tried in the past few months so I feel like I've had a bit of experience...Just a bit. I can say with absolute certainty that these are well worth the price. I had no idea I could get this kind of sound and battery life from a pair of ear buds in this price range. The sound stage is overall very neutral. They hit at all the right spots for my taste. The mids sound great...you can hear all the little details. Treble errs a little bit on the bright side, but not overly so...Still neutral without being at all muddy. Bass is where the magic happens (for me). I cannot stand headphones that boost the bass, and these definitely keep things in BALANCE. The lows sound solid throughout, but if you have your volume turned up too high you might get some artifacting with the deepest lows. If you're looking for some heavy bass, these are not the earbuds for you. Genre I've found that sound the absolute best - Classic Rock (Queen sounds amazing), Alternative, Classical or Instrumental, and Oldies. They just sound fantastic...rich and clean. Everything you want. Rap sounds decent, but remember the bass isn't going to blow you away. Industrial and Metal sound really good, but the deep lows aren't what I would expect. IDM/Techno/Dubstep is going to sound pretty mellow. I don't listen to country, so I can't say how it sounds....
Battery life is exactly what the box claims. After the initial charge I went from 100% to roughly 76% after six hours of almost non-stop use. After three days of testing, I'm getting fairly consistent results. Six hours = About 25% battery used. The case seems to hold a really good charge, too. I charged it once on arrival and it is still showing full after three nights of re-charging the earbuds. Not shabby at all. I'm extremely impressed as they blow the other BT sets I've got out of the water with their longevity. Also...Welcome to 2019....These charge using USB-C. NICE. I've completely abandoned my wired headphones now, and I had just bought a USB-C DAC to use them with my iPad. These are just so much more convenient, and the sound is very much comparable. I love that these automatically connect to the last device they were paired with. That was kind of a shock at first, so just know it happens. Haha. I ended up having to reset my connection because I didn't know and I un-paired using the buttons. Two things to note: There is no volume control on the earbuds, and they don't come with memory foam tips. I will definitely be getting some of those in the near future."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-19,Amazing,Great sound. Super comfortable. And they came fully charged
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-20,Thank you ear fun,Ear fun replaced my last pair with the quickness because was having issues with battery and connecting but now no problems and everything is working great. Factory worker
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-23,Great sound....well built,Great Product!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-24,Excellent Return Service,Thanks
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-08-25,Amazing earbuds!,"Earfun free are awesome earbuds that are well made and fit nicely into the ear. I pay very close attention to the sound and have several earbuds that I have tried. Earfun Free beats the competition on several aspects. I compared it to Soundcore Liberty Neo earbuds since they are at the same price point and claim to have a lot of similar technology. Case: Earfun free come in a wireless charging case, led indicators in the front indicating battery level and has USB-C charging. Soundcore liberty neo does not even come close in this area, the only thing Neo has is LED indicators and still uses micro USB. Fit: Earfun earbuds fit really snug into the ear and do not fall off while running or during daily chores. Soundcore neo fit well (not as nicely as earfun free) and you have to be careful while running or workout. Weight: Earfun free are lighter in weight compared to Soundcore Liberty Neo (although the website says neo is 0.2 oz which is same as Earfun free, I felt they were heavier than Earfun free). Heavier the earbud more painful it will be throughout the day. Connectivity: Both of them support Bluetooth 5.0 and the connectivity of earfun free is rock solid. Did not experience any skips or drops. Speaker quality: Earfun free has dual 6mm graphene speakers that produce incredible sound quality, deep bass and crystal clear treble. Liberty Neo are good but not as great as earfun free, although I like the bassup feature in Neo. Battery: Earfun free gives you about 6 hours of playtime per charge compared to 3 hours in Soundcore liberty Neo. The case of earfun free provides up to 24 hours of extra battery life to the earbuds compared to Liberty Neo which is only 8-9 hours. Waterproof: Earfun free are water proof and sweatproof, I did not put it through the salt water or the swimming pool test but I did use them during my regular workout. They fared well. Liberty neo are not waterproof. Overall I strongly recommend Earfun free as it trumps its competitor in every single area. A must buy."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-26,Audio is Incredibly Crisp,"Finally a set of headphones that check all the boxes! Pros:
- Wirelss earbuds
- No nonsense connectivity. No issues turning them on or off or connecting or syncing. It just works, every time the second you pull it from the case. - Sound is incredibly clear and crisp. (much more so than my old $44 wireless headphones and easily in competition with my old $180 sony over ear headphones)
- Long battery life (I've used them for a couple weeks and have yet to run them dead (earbuds), in fact I don't even know how long they last, but my longest single session has been like 3.5 hours and it handled it just fine.) - USB C (Why is this so hard to find!?) - Actually Waterproof not just water resistant ( I shower with them at least every other day or so and sweat like a sweat monster when working out. Zero issues. Haven't tried swimming yet, but I'd be brave enough to try after my experience.) - Wireless charging? Didn't know I wanted it but my new phone has it so yesss. - Ludicrous range. Very forgiving. Cons:
- Case is just a tad chubbier than I'd prefer. Thinner but bigger would be better imo. - Base could be a touch better. With so many quality of life implementations compared to older headphones of mine, I really can't complain. If I broke these, i'd buy them again in a split. Zero hesitation or regrets."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-26,Not very loud,Very good bass. They not that loud. Overall I am satisfaid.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-08-26,battery pod died in 30 days,"I was happy with the sound quality, battery life. However, the battery pod completely stopped working (getting charged) in less than a month. Update: EarFun Customer service contacted me and replaced the unit."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-08-26,Fits very well,Awesome sound quality and build. Great for gym and running as fits very well. Fast shipping and amazing bass truly a good deal.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-31,"Great Sound, Great Battery, Great Price , Great Headphones!","I highly recommend these headphones. Nice quality sound with deep base, and are noise canceling. The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I use the headphones daily throughout the entire day and without the charging case they last about 1-2 hours. I only have to recharge the case like 2-3 times a week and it only takes like an hour to recharge. The case is a little bulky and it can fit in your pocket, but might feel awkward. There isn't really any grip either on the case so it can slip out of your hands from time to time. They are a little bulky and you can't keep them in your ears for long periods of time. They will not fall out though. I went bouldering/rock climbing with them and i was sweating, falling, hanging upside down and they never fell out. They are great headphones with great reviews for a great price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-02,awesome sound quality!!!,Thanks Oluv for running this earphones! just sound great!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-02,They sound as good as or better then my akg wired headphones that came with my s9,"i thought that most wireless headphones sucked unless you got them from name brands like Bose, Sony, Crap apple, and Samsung. But boy was i wrong i actually use them in the shower and pool and they hold up to the ipx7 rating really well. To be honest I almost mistook these for galaxy buds and I've had galaxy buds before but these actually sound better then the air-pods 2 and galaxy buds. Also the fact that they charge wirelessly and USB-c is perfect and most devices should use USB-c. curse you apple for being exclusive and still use that craptastic lighting cable."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-02,10/10,Muy buenos
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-09-04,Excellent Sound and Top Notch Customer Service are Second to None,"First let me say that while I am an Amazon Prime member, I purchased two pair of EarFun Free TWS earbuds through their Indiegogo Campaign (before they were offered on Amazon) for the same price as sold here on Amazon, so my review will not be labeled as “Verified Purchase.”
I had been researching TWS earbuds for close to 2 years. Either they cost an arm and a leg for mediocre to reasonably good quality, or they were cheaply made and reflected that in the reviews of so many YouTube reviewers. I did audition a pair of Bose SoundSports. And while the sound was good, they were so large and bulky, and hurt my ears after a short period of time. And the connection between the earbuds was unstable. So I kept waiting, and waiting—until Oluv introduced the EarFun Free TWS earbuds on his YouTube channel. He got me interested in this full-featured set of TWS earbuds. And they received his hearty approval. The EarFun Free TWS earbuds use the latest 5.0 Bluetooth for super-quick and stable connections, are completely waterproof, use advanced 6mm graphene drivers, use the latest USB-C charging in addition to wireless charging, last for 6 hours between charges, and are so comfortable, they can be literally be worn for hours without ear fatigue. This pair met all my expectations! Buttons: These earbuds do not have capacitive touch controls. The jury is still out on the overall positive-versus-negative benefits of capacitive touch controls, and proponents are on both sides of the issue. I do not have to push hard at all to operate the push button controls. I quickly learned how much is enough, and I have never needed to push harder than that. Some users might think that they have to push harder than they really need to. But rest assured, just push the amount needed and you’ll be fine. I write, arrange, record and mix music using Apple’s Logic Pro X DAW, so audio fidelity is critical to me. These earbuds are so accurate, that after working on a song, I will bounce it as a high-quality MP3 and then listen through these earbuds to help my evaluation for end use. Customer Service: Just like their incredible earbuds, Customer Service is top notch! Couldn’t be happier! Bottom Line: The incredible feature set of these earbuds—and for the price—is second to none!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-09-04,It's alright,"So I really want to like these. They look good, are water proof, and noise cancelling but the audio quality is passable, the left one is quieter than the right one. And I can only use the right one by itself. I cant use the left by itself which sucks when I am using them all day. It would be nice to be able to charge one and use the other. a Month Later.... I had called amazon and they sent me a replacement. It worked normally for a week and then the left got much quieter than the right, just like before. I also was getting an echo effect because the left one was barely delayed. I have returned both and got my money back
Update: 11/10/2019 - after returning both back, the customer service team contacted me and sent me out a third set. After about a month, I have not had the left one get quieter. I have bumped their rating to 4 stars because of their customer service. In terms of the product itself, they fit very well, the sound quality is good, call quality is ok, have not noticed the echo effect as much as I did before, I still do not like the fact that I cant run them independently though. Bug I had mentioned that to their customer service team and they told me it is something the brought up to their engineers and hopefully is changed on newer models"
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-09-05,Amazon,the sound quality is amazing Even without using any equalizer they sound great. The quality is great I just love these ear buds
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-06,Great,Amazed at how great these are the sound is better than any earbuds I've had. Super comfortable and can withstand the gym sweat
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-06,Very comfortable fit and great sound.,"I find it hard to get earbuds that fit well. Something about the shape or sensitivity of my ears make most of them uncomfortable for me. These have a unique shape that fits really well in my ear. They are more than loud enough as they block out most extraneous sounds with the good fit. The battery has outlasted my listening sessions, and the case recharges them multiple times. The case has a magnetic fit to ensure charging. The sound is really nice, and when I had a small problem with one of the earbuds, the seller responded immediately to resolve it."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-09-07,Great customer but earbuds were great while they lasted,"So as I had mentioned I was already impressed with the customer service and care support this company offers. I purchased it and that piece had microphone issues and then battery so the company sent me another piece after they read my review. That piece had decent microphone it’s like they paid attention, but battery really needed work and it died. So they refunded my money. Recently they emailed me to test their earbuds to see if I can comment on improvements. The new piece has improved but microphone needs work. Battery life is working, it’s been a week of use. For now I am giving a boost to support great customer service and support. Kudos team earfun!! I am truly impressed with the customer service the company has to offer. The earbuds were great when they worked I requested money back as with two tries the battery life just never made it. But truly HATS OFF TO CUSTOMER SERVICE
Sorry good while you lasted but alas order was placed on September 5th and the earbuds are now dead I have asked the vendor for warranty, if they reply I will update it in the review. Earbuds kindly focus on battery life. This is my take of the earbuds- my main purpose was good, not expensive exercise earbuds, this had a lot 5 stars so I said let me try it. I would call these good exercise earbuds. I own AirPods but when I run, sweat causes them to slip of the ear. I debated purchasing overhead to in the ear and tried over the ear too, which ended up being too bulky. Now to these earbuds:
Pros:
Decent for exercise
Don’t fall out
Came well packaged
Choices on earbuds padding size (s,m,l)
Small to carry
Can be used individually *** but u need have the right one on first
Charging is good for a day worth use
Sound is decent
Cons:
Voice calls muffled
Good be smaller
Need to have right earbuds on first
I purchased the black color earbuds. In all if need cheap running earbuds that don’t make you anxious by falling off then these could be the ones . With the AirPods I am always worried it’s going to fall of the ear. While running I like to be aware of what’s around me so in short these will not shut of the outside world and still allow you to hear music. I needed good grip in the ears, decent sound while running and not too pricey earbuds. I throw them in the gym back unlike me having to be too careful like with the AirPods. Improvement needed on ability to use it for voice calls, sizing and ear on recognition in both earbuds. I am judging the sound and battery life in comparison to other earbuds as these are just for running."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-07,Great for the price as good as galaxy buds for less,"Love that they are waterproof and can last a decent amount of time, only downside sometimes they dont charge completely not sure yet why"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-07,My Ear Buds Are Great,"I Love My Ear Buds, I Use Them Everyday On The Train On My Way To Work"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-09,Better then I expected ..,"Great earbuds for a good price. Sound,comfort, and quality.."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-15,Awesome,The sound quality on these babies are awesome. I love this. They cancel out any noise. I love how the box will charge the ear buds without it being plugged in. I love these. I thought they were going to get stuck in my ears but nope. They are awesome.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-09-18,Jury is still out but happy at the moment,"Another update. Earfun has been in contact with me over the past few months. Over that time they have been very interested in my experience with their product. I truly believe that they are interested in providing a good quality product. I have since tried their over ear headphones and were quite impressed with the quality. I would recommend people give them a try as their support team is top notch and work very hard to ensure satisfaction with the product. Update 9/29/2019
After an uneventful couple of weeks with the new pair, the left bud started cutting out on a regular basis. After going through all the reset steps which didn't help, I finally resorted to asking for a refund. To their credit, they replied very quickly and credited my Amazon account. The support experience with them has been very pleasant. Just don't think the earbuds are ready for prime time yet. I have been on a mission to find the perfect set of wireless earbuds with the caveat that I don't want to spend a ton of money. I have purchased a few from Indiegogo as well as a few pairs off Amazon. With each pair, either the sound wasn't good, the connection failed, the volume wasn't loud enough, they weren't comfortable, etc. Always something wrong. Recently I upped my spending limit and purchased the Melomania from Cambridge Audio. Easily the best sounding pair that I've experienced, great battery life, small case, but the problem with them was they weren't all that comfortable to wear and they still used a micro-usb cable. When I saw the Earfun buds, I thought I might have found my perfect pair. On paper, good battery, supposedly good sound (based on many reviews), USB C or wireless charging. What I received was a pair of earbuds that did not stay connected, didn't automatically pair out of the box among other problems. I went through their instructions about resetting, etc. but nothing worked. I thought I had run into another over-hyped pair of earbuds. Because I really wanted them to work, I took a chance and emailed the support address provided with the pair and explained all of the things that didn't work as advertised. I received a response a few days later explaining that I might have got a bad set and that they would be sending me another set (didn't have to return the first even though they are basically useless). Sucks that it took 12 days to receive them, but I did receive the new pair and after a few days of use, they are everything that they were originally advertised to be. No connection problems, auto pairing, comfortable, above average sound. Time will tell whether all the good stuff lasts, but at this moment, I'm very happy with the purchase. I guess it goes to show that there are pretty vast differences in quality control between sets that are manufactured."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-09-19,"Solid earbuds, one tiny drawback","This pair of earbuds come to save me from sweating my ears out using my big PXC-550 while walking outside or riding the metro. Sound quality is second to none, wireless connectivity is great, and the ability to charge the case on my Qi chargers is outstanding. Definitively it has features of way more expensive earbuds. By far. I only have one tiny issue with them and is that I believe that you should control playback and speakerphone with your phone directly, since pushing the buttons on the sides make the earbuds really dig into your ears, and become a bit uncomfortable after a few pushes. I had to remove and re-set the earbuds when advancing on my playlist a few songs. You can also grab the earbud with your middle and thumb, and push the button with the index. That can work too. I really have no problem with that. Only my PXC-550 is a dream to use, since the controls are touch-based, and implementing this at this price range would have been impossible, but just be aware of that. Other than that, they are a very solid product, with an unbeatable price, superb build and sound quality, waterproof and very easy to carry around. I think is a winner."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-09-20,Failed on all counts,"Worked fine for one month, then the right (master) bud abruptly died. No warning at all. One day working perfectly, the next completely dead. The left (slave) bud can’t connect with the right bud and therefore does nothing except blink while trying to pair with the other dead bud. Tried all the troubleshooting including hard resets and cleaning the contacts. Tried to use the warranty site, but it doesn’t complete the submission process. Save your money. There are so many options available, that even if the pair I got was an anomaly, the uselessness of the warranty processing site is enough reason to take your business elsewhere."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-23,Works!,"I had an issue with the left ear bud failing, but was sent a replacement quickly. The sound quality is amazing. With audio playing at moderate volume, I don't hear any ambient noise. It easily lasts through my usage for the day."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-23,Good price point and good quality,"i was pleasantly surprised by the features and function these provide. sound quality isnt on the level of say the beats wireless but they still offer good sound, especially for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-23,Amazing!!!,These are amazing!! Sound great!!! The battery lasts long and so easy to use!!! Loveee them!!! :)
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-24,"Very impressed, well worth $50!","I usually use on-ear Bose Bluetooth headphones with my iPhone but I was in the market for something more discrete and portable. I was considering finally buying some AirPods, but $200 (for the model with the wireless charging case) is crazy considering the relatively poor audio quality and lack of water resistance. I found these EarFun earbuds by chance and they seemed to tick everything off on my checklist, so at $50 a pair it wasn't hard to pull the trigger. I was prepared to be really underwhelmed, considering their affordability, but I'm actually beyond impressed. They fit great (and comfortably) and the audio quality is good to great (relative to other earbuds, even wired ones). I've tested them with various genres of music I enjoy - rock, metal, country, EDM, hip-hop, and they've got a balanced sound that doesn't skimp on bass. Connectivity with my iPhone is a breeze, and consistent (no audio drops or skips - something even my $200 Bose on-ears can't keep up with). The wireless charging case works as advertised, and calls are clear on both ends. Though I haven't worn these in the shower or anything they do seem to be totally waterproof. I can't comment on battery life yet, but I don't anticipate any problems. If I had to list some drawbacks, I'd say that the charging case is a little bulky. Not a big problem, but it does hinder portability - especially if you wear slimmer clothing and don't want bulging pockets. Also, the mechanical buttons are sometimes unresponsive, and they don't let you control the volume. Some people may find pushing the buttons to be uncomfortable, considering doing so pushes the audio tip further into your ear canal, but it's not a big problem for me. So, at at $50, I say these are well worth it. They offer greater value than the top model AirPods, at a quarter oft he price, with negligible drawbacks."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-25,Great communication! Great earbuds..,Great! !
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-09-25,Took 30 minutes to finally pair,Update: After getting the ear buds to pair they seem to be working fine. They go in and out every once in awhile. The volume could be a little louder too. Otherwise they seem to be decent for the money.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-25,"If you are looking for awesome sound at a reasonable price, toy need these ear buds!!!",Love my Bluetooth wireless earbuds ! They easily connect and sound quality is great! buying several pair for Christmas presents!

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-26,Good wireless earbuds,Work well. Good sound. Just needed a reset out of the box to establish connection
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-09-27,good stylist - water proof - good with the price range,"no cancelation compare to the sony but the quality is good in bass. the ear is really fix to my ear, no drop thread even we move a lot. the USB-C is a plus. it is small than sony so it fix well in your pocket. minor : there is no touch function but it feel good enough when you press it. the function is reverse with sony so if you want to pair you have to press right ear not left. updated : headphone battery is long enough for the whole 5 hours flight"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-28,These are a good quality set of earbuds that are simple to set up and easy to use.,"These are a good quality set of earbuds that are simple to set up and easy to use. The audio is great on both music and phone calls. In fact, the phone call was phenomenal quality for earbuds. The case is chargeable with either the USB C cord provided or with a wireless charger. The earbuds disconnect and turn off when put into the case and turn on and automatically re connect when you take them out of the case. I am not sure yet how many times the case will recharge the earbuds before needing to be recharged itself. These are a great set of earbuds for a decent price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-29,To meet my expectations!,"It’s pretty nice to listen your favorite music, specially to workout!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-01,Better than expected,"I didn’t know I would like these so much because of the price but I’m glad I got these. They were extremely easy to pair. As soon as I took them out the box they synced to my phone no problems. I tested them out and to my surprise my husband came in to ask me if it okay because I couldn’t hear him calling me, so apparently the noise cancelling works good because I didn’t hear a thing. I mainly got these for the gym since they’re waterproof and so far no damage has been made to them."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-01,Highly recommended until yesterday.,"Meets all my expectations. Usb-C charging is very fast using a 3amp charging block. The only negative to these true wireless earbuds is I was unable to get my wireless charger to work. As of October 2nd the charging case stopped working or should I state it will not charge the right earbud. For the past month and 12 days I have been very happy with these earbuds, now depending on how Earfun handles this issue will reflect on my next post"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-02,Very satisfied with it...,"Very happy with them, they sound very good, the battery is great, and for its price I am happy"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-02,Can't beat it!,"Great quality. The build is nice (charging case and ear buds), fit is perfect and the charge lasts as advertised (right about 5hrs and 45 min for my longest use between charges). Unless you just want to pay 3 to 4 times as much for a ""status"" symbol product, you can't beat the value here."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-02,Work GREAT !,They have been working great! I have used them while driving an open jeep and the sound is good on both ends during phone calls.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-04,Solid Earbud w/ a Major Case Design Flaw,"I'm a fan of Earfun as I also have purchased their waterproof Bluetooth speaker which has great sound for $40. I was really excited to receive these earbuds since they checked everything on my requirements list. They have good sound, an ergonomic shape that fits my ears, a reliable bluetooth 5,0 connection, and a USB-C charging case. Battery life has been solid so far as well. The downsides of this product are:
1) The button interactions on each earbud are not intuitive. Skipping backward and forward between tracks is handled by two or three taps on a single earbud instead of a long hold or double taps on both earbuds like most other manufacturers. 2) There is no way to change between EQ presets or modify the EQ to your preferences. There is also no mobile app for interacting with the earbud settings or to make firmware updates. 3) If you swap out the included rubber tips for something slightly larger like Comfy foam tips then the earbuds will not fit in the case anymore. This has been a real pain for me since I basically cannot charge the earbuds in the included case unless I remove the foam tips first."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-04,Almost perfect,"These would be the perfect earbuds but the following things are a disappoinment:
-random sound spikes in the left earbud
-sometimes earbuds have to be placed back into case inorder to hear music
-the supplied silicon tips are not sufficient in keeping a tight seal. Earfun should consider placing earfins in the package with their future earbuds; this might recitify the seal issue. Other than the aforementioned complaints, I truly like these buds. The sound is well-balanced (focus is primarily on the highs and mids but the lows are still good), lightweight, and both the buds and case charge quickly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-04,They are amazing! A must buy!,I got these today and could not wait to use them. I plugged them in for 2 hours just to make sure I had a good charge. They paired very easily with my Iphone. I was not sure the sound would be good but it was AMAZING! The bass was even strong. Love that they are water and sweat proof. They perform far better than my expensive bose pair. A must buy! And the wireless charging was a bonus!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-04,Good,Good so far
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-05,NICE Bluetooth Earbuds....Good fit and GREAT sounding!!!,"What a bargain for the price!!! They fit well, Sound GREAT and come in a nice charging case. Easily connected to my iPhone and Apple TV...WOW! !"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-10-05,Trash,"They work perfect for the first day but the next day they just sounded like a piece of garbage, I’m getting a replacement let’s see how those work"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-06,Good sound but could be better,It’s cool. I just can’t really find a good fit on my ears.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-06,Excellent earbuds at a fair price!,"Until recently, I have been using and burning through your traditional earbuds. They're fairly cheap, easy to find, and if I lose a pair, or it breaks, no big deal. I'll just spend a couple more dollars and get another pair. However, I have started to feel a little guilty about this disposable lifestyle choice, and if I'm being honest, I am tired of untangling cords, crackling noise, and volume going in and out. Therefore, I decided it was time to finally find a nice pair of wireless earbuds. Of course, my mind immediately jumped to Bose, Beats, Apple, etc. but I wasn't quite ready to drop that kind of money on a luxury, not a necessity. My search continued until I found this EarFun brand. 1. The price was in my range. 2. It offered wireless charging. 3. It advertised an impressive battery life. 4. It claimed to be waterproof. So I ordered these earbuds and gave them a try. I have tested these for a few weeks under various conditions and circumstances, including work, soccer practices, yard work, house work, etc. To say I was pleased would be an understatement. Every test I gave these earbuds exceeded my expectations. In addition to providing excellent audio, they also helped tune out outside noise. I couldn't hear my lawnmower. I couldn't hear screaming kids at practice. I couldn't hear my annoying coworkers. Now, it didn't make all these activities something that I would seek out, but it did make them more bearable. In addition to great sound and noise-cancelling effects, I liked the range on these earbuds. I could play an audiobook on my smartphone and, if I needed to keep it plugged in and charging, I could walk away into the other room and it would still be clear audio. All these great features though, and my favorite feature is the battery life. In addition to the earbuds themselves having a long battery life, the case also allows charging on the go, because it can hold 24 hours worth of charge, which is amazing! In a nutshell, if you are looking for quality earbuds at a fair price, I recommend you give these a try! I plan on buying a second pair for my wife!"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-07,Not Good,The sound is way too low. It's so hard to hear anything. I'm very disappointed
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-07,Trust me and don't buy these.,"I received them in a decent time frame from Amazon however, upon opening the box there was a post-it not stuck inside on the product. This post-it note said, ""Left earbud does not work, Sorry."" After reading this I thought surely no way they would actually sell me these so I charged them, connected them and sure enough, the left one would not work. So save your money and go find another pair to buy."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-07,It's fairly quiet but it's pretty good I guess,I bought this for school because I hated bringing my beats headset because they were huge and I had a great fear that they would break in my bag and my hair for a guys is very long and pulled my hair whenever I take them off. I wanted something at a good price just to listen to music I didn't really care for much. Now I'm gonna say it these headphones are great for the price the sound quality is very similar to my beats but just slightly worse. I've had it about for 2 weeks maybe and I charged it once and I use them pretty frequently. They fit well in my pocket and the case feels pretty premium. My only severe problem with this product is how quiet they are. I don't know if it's because of Android 10 or my phone doesn't like me but these things are impractical if you just wanna walk in public. If your in your room by yourself it's fine like it's loud and clear but in public it's terrible. Also your ear piece would just dissconect from one another if you turn them off or disconnect them by accident and it takes like 20 seconds to re-pair them. I don't know if I would recommend these for something like working out in a public gym or if your doing groceries but if you workout at home or just use it as your headphones for like doing the dishes it's a great product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-07,"Small earbuds, cool charger","These small earbuds are easy to wear, easy to charge, and offer good sound quality. My wife likes them - she's noted a few issues with connectivity with her HP laptop, but this may be related to the laptop. Long battery life, she's very happy with them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-07,EarFun Wireless Earbuds,These wireless ear buds are the best purchase of earbuds that I have made. They look amazing and perform great. They fit snug into your ear and don’t fall out when performing various tasks. The sound is outstanding and very clear. Would definitely suggest these earbuds to anyone looking for great quality product!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-08,Great for the price,I wanted these for running. They're great for basically everything except this; based on my ears anyway.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-08,Bang for your buck! Love the noise cancellation,"These headphones were a great addition to my office.. I had been looking for noise cancelling headphones to zone out at work and the noise cancellation feature on these is 10/10. They’re comfortable to where you can wear them and forget they’re in... What is key for me also is that I can only use one in ear, as needed...
The sound can be a little louder for me, but considering the noise cancellation, it evens out"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-08,Good stuff,Very nice earbuds. Sound is great and battery is as described. Don't have to plug in more than once a week.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-08,They work great!,I bought these for my son. He is in high school. He absolutely loves everything about these.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-08,Excellent customer experience,I received my replacement unit after my initial pair stopped working. Best work out earbuds with great sound.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-09,Great for the price!!!,An up and down volume control would be helpful. Other than that I am very satisfied with the product overall.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-10,Best buds under $50!,Best true wireless under $50 and comparable to the expensive ones too. Very happy with the purchase.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-10,"Nice waterproof fit, excellent sound.","These are my wife's earbuds. I picked them because they are waterproof and came in a charging case.

EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-10-11,A sound investment (pun intended),"Very comfy fit. I am a tow truck driver so hands free isn't only safe, it's a requirement. Call quality sounds great too. I've had these a few months now and never lost one...until last night. First time ever it fell out while laying under a car trying to hook up to it. Unfortunately it was raining and dark out and it fell into the grass so...couldn't find it. Will be buying again soon though."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-12,Worth the money!,"+Update - The company was great, they contacted me and told me how to get the item to work (although i didnt need this info, its not hard to get a bluetooth headset to work, they just didnt work) ---and then they sent me a FREE one as well, as i did return the original. The 2nd pair came and work GREAT, out of the box. The sound Quality is just average, but they connect without any delay and battery life is solid as well."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-13,Quality earbuds but problematic connectivity,"I loved the build quality and battery life of these earbuds, the price to performance ratio is stunning and I adore those earbuds. My reason for giving these 2 stars (now five, read edit) is that about a month and a half after purchasing these earbuds the left one started to not connect to the right earbud, the audio is incredibly flakey and while it still controls the right ear the left ear is basically unusable. I would love to get this issue remedied and I have contacted Earfun support. Edit: they immediately replaced my earbuds once I explain the problem I was having, they have done a stellar job."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-13,"Works well, pretty sweet.","I like that these magnetically stay in their case, feels solid. It's also pretty cool that they can wirelessly charge on our wireless charging station thing. They have pretty good sound but feel a bit big in my ear, even the smallest bud thing. Would also make a good gift."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-14,Comfortable,"After some frustrations getting the earbuds to pair with my iphone 11 things work very well now. These are very comfortable for me. The noise cancellation was an added benefit. To me the sound is great, but I'm no expert. The battery life seems ok so far."

EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-16,Good Product,Great sound quality. Wanted to get flagship buds but didn't wanted to spend much. So ordered this and works really well with my galaxy phone. Easy pairing and stays in ear. This has premium quality feel.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-18,Great gift,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. They arrived in a nice box. They look perfect in my husband's ears and very light. The sound is clear and loud enough for my husband. He works as a HVAC instaler and this earbuts are very convenient for him. He uses them during his work, and they do their job well. They made well and perfect as a gift."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-18,How is this so affordable!?,Paired to my laptop and started using right when I got them! Sound great! Lets see how they hold up when I work out!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-19,Good Fit,"Thesse fit in my ear and did a great job with noise cancelation. They paired to both my Samsung and my daughter's iPhone very easily. The sound quality is good. The battery life is only around 6 hours. While I can't say I typically use them that long anyway, a bit longer would be nice, just in case."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-10-19,Wireless earphones,"I bought these for my husband and they kept falling off his ears. I am not sure why! Overall I gave it a 3 start, this might be good for others, but not for us!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-19,Good sound and featuress - UPDATE,"Edit 1/30/2020:
I've now rated these with five stars. Whatever problems I noted below have been solved by the recent upgrade. And the problem I had with the controls on Spotify on my phone no longer exist, because my iPhone 6s died; I've replaced it and everything works fine. These are now my favorite cheap wireless earbuds, and I recommend them highly. Great sound, battery life, and features. These sound quite good, even on classical music. The features are impressive - USB-C, good battery life, wireless charging, IPX7. But the controls are maddening. Two clicks on the left earbud to advance, three clicks on the left to go back. This is not intuitive, nor is it similar to any other earbud I've tried. And there's no ability to control volume on the earbuds themselves. I'm returning these after buying a set of the Tranya T3's for a similar price - they don't have quite the same features, but the sound is just as good, the controls are a lot more intuitive and typical, and I can control volume. Edit: When I found out that Earfun had updated these, I decided to give them another try. The sound is still great, and they've fixed the controls to something more ""standard"". Well, almost. The controls work fine on Amazon Music, Netflix, and my podcast app - but not with Spotify. For whatever reason, with Spotify I can only adjust the volume - no play/pause, no next/previous track. Maddening."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-19,Unstable connection,Left ear bud never worked. Right ear bud just kept cutting in and out. Tried resetting them multiple times. Maybe I just have a bad pair. But they fit in the ear pretty nice but haven't been able to really test the audio.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-19,Better than overpriced AirPods,Love this product especially for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-20,quality,Bluetooth link does not always link with device after the initial setup and can be a little tricky getting them to link again. One earbud stop working after a week or so. Sent them back and received a new pair. So far I've been happy with the sound and quality.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-20,Best all around affordable option! Look no further!!,"sound quality and call quality is the best out of the budget earbuds I've tested. This is the 6th set I've tried and finally found a winner. What could be better? buttons could be touch vs. click so skipping tracks doesn't push bud in your ear more but my experience is the touch buttons on the market are overly sensitive or not enough so these work. If you're looking for affordable buds that sound good, have good call quality and decent battery life these are a solid pick!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-20,Can't pair both buds to phone,For the price I would give this product 5 stars but unfortunately I've only been able to pair the right master side to my phone I have a Samsung note 9 and it's been a problem.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-20,Only right side paring with bluetooth ***UPDATE***,"I received my product wow looks can be deceiving. The packaging and quality was top notch I could not wait to try. But that was all short lived when only one side was paring and not the other. Bluetooth was only paring with the right side and not the left. I tried to troubleshoot and still no luck. But I will give the seller another chance cause I ordered a replacement rather than a refund. I will up once I receive the new pair. Update update
I received the replacement pair and it worked ok but you had to have then both on in order for them to it seems the left was not functional unless the right was right next to it. And they were so uncomfortable to wear so I returned them and got the samsung ear buds since those do work independently and more comfortable."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-21,Siund it was greath,"I love that earbuds, the noise cancellation and the battery life are the best. The only thing to considerate to improve in that product it was the volume in the music is to low. But the quality of the sound it was greath"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-22,Great but kinda bulky,Only downfall is they are bulky and look kinda big in the ear
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-22,Very good for the price.,"Sound quality isn’t quite as good as I think it could be. I would like them to be a little bit louder and crisp sounding. But it definitely isn’t bad by any stretch. The side buttons are nice, but you have to push pretty hard which shoves the earbud into your ear. I love the option to only have one in, but I wish you could choose left or right, instead of just R. Bluetooth hooks up flawlessly. Battery life is amazing. Definitely the best I’ve seen. I can go a week or two without recharging
All around these are a very decent wireless earbuds for the price. I think with just some fine tuning, they would beat their competition out of the water!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-23,Star Wars and funky time,"They stayed in perfectly as I was clapping the lovely cheeks of my lady while playing the Star Wars Cantina Theme crisper than an Autumn day. 5 stars! Literally nothing bad about these. Great fit, comfortable, great sound, cheap, what more can you ask for?"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-23,"Nice design, good sound and good battery life","You know that a product is good only with the presentation, they have taken the time to make a good packaging, the podruct is well taken care of, easy to pair with my Samsung Note 9 the sound is excellent you can control it from the cell phone or by the button that they have incorporated, I love them, excellent to go to the gym they are neither too small nor too large I would say the size to perfect. I have 8 hours using and still have batery"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-23,Wireless charging,Great item. Very happy with it. Love that it’s compatible with wireless charging
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-23,The Holy Grail for $40,"Thanks to Amazon's generous return policy I've been able to search for the perfect earbuds/headphones. I've run the gamut from expensive Sony headphones, Beats Power Pros, Jabra's, Plantronics to cheaper MPow, Taotronics, Skullcandy---you name it. I tried them all. Mostly they were all very uncomfortable or the noise cancellation was mediocre, even with the more high end brands. And I returned them all. Thank you Amazon. Then I saw a review of these buds on CNET. They even said the reviews were legit according to ReviewMeta and Fakespot. And I concur. As CNET said (read it), these things are almost too good to be true. But they are. The fidelity is astounding, incredibly balanced with thundering bass, the comfort is unsurpassed, and you don't need noice cancellation when the noise isolation does the job. I don't know how they do this for $40, but they slay everything out there. Hopefully, they'll last a while, but even if they do for a year or two you can't go wrong."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-24,What's an Airpod????,"Wow! Not sure how many of these other reviews are real or not, but boi!! these headphones rock. If you want a headphone that can go head to head with the Airpods, this is it. It pairs seamlessly and the sound is great. Most of all, the quality of the noise cancelling is amazing."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-24,Don't jump at the high rating,"**Please note: after writing this review, I have been badgered by the seller to upgrade my comments. **
There is firm placement in the ear (an earplug design). . .rather bulky and heavy however. The technology is great in concept, but I question the quality control. Too many buyers feel cheated and misinformed. The bluetooth connections are unreliable on a grand scale. There is an effort at documentation, but it is scant. (I question whether there is any technological documentation created/designed utilizing input from the potential user. Hardware sales would be enhanced if producers interacted with end users early the the process."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-24,Great product with cheap price,"Amazing product for affordable price. I listened to music all day, but the battery only drained 25%. The sound isolation is also great. I used the regular microphone that came with my phone, and whoever sat next to me would hear what I was listening to. But with this earbud, it is totally isolated."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-24,Nice bass and good battery life.,"Easy to connect and good battery life. Treble and midrange is decent, bass is almost non existent initially. After changing ear bud size and initial break in these ear buds sound amazing. Highly recommended for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-25,Great Customer Service and earbuds quality,"The sound of these earbuds is awesome for the price you are paying. These are really good and I will recomend to friends and family. Also, the customer service from the company is exceptional. I was having issues with the first pair I got, and wrote them a message. They immediately send out a replacement. The quality and customer service deserve 5 stars."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-25,Great product at a great price.,"I've had these for a little over a week now. I consider them well worth the money. The sound quality is great. They fit my ears comfortably and stay put (which has been a problem with other earbuds). I think they've dropped 3 times in a week, but all of them could have been cell phone connection issues. I am most impressed with the base and how long the batteries last. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-25,Perfect and at a good price,"I spent almost $300 for Sony earbuds that do not have the fit, sound quality, or battery life as good as these ones. I am very happy with my purchase and am enjoying using the earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-25,So easy to use out of the box!,"Wow, really impressed with these especially for the price. Definitely recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-26,FINALLY decent wireless EarPods!,"This is, like, the 4th pair of wireless earbuds I have attempted to buy because I’m too cheap to pony up for airpods. Not a single pair I bought managed to pair properly and half of them were too uncomfortable to wear even if they did work, which they didn’t, and all the reviews were clearly fake. I was just about ready to give up and cough up the dough for AirPods because they’re on sale but I thought I’d try one more time...
SO glad I did! These actually do what they say they do! They’re easy to operate, paired right away (both with each other and my phone), they’re super comfortable to wear (my ears are too small for regular earbuds and I usually have to wear over the over headphones, so this was a very pleasant surprise), the case is small and convenient to carry around, and the sound quality is great! (I’m no audiophile but I don’t want a tinny sound and when I made a phone call with them the person on the other end couldn’t tell I was using a Bluetooth device.) I truly couldn’t be happier!! AND I saved over $100 not buying airpods! Total win!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-26,pleased,i use walking the dog...pool time...etc. They have been great so far ...but have a tendency to fall out of my ears at times! I probably need to spend some time figuring out the best way to position in my ear!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-26,Value for money.,"Great quality, long6h+ battery life, and good Bluetooth connection. Sound is very clear and very good for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-26,Better than most $200 earbuds for most people,"Had them for a while and still on first charge, love that it has USB C and the case is small and handy, looking forward to using these on my flight soon."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-10-26,Why are these rated so high? Poor volume,"How these headphones got 4.5 stars blows my mind. Pros: They connect very fast and have a good battery life. Cons: The quality is okay and clean, but the volume level is terrible. They are significantly lower volume than my other 2 wireless earbuds. I can still hear the sound of the treadmill or stair-climber I am on. Other con, they don't fit very comfortably in my ears---yes I tried the different size plugs to obtain the best fit. I will be returning these after writing this review. I did a side by side comparison with my Juckbo wireless earbuds and PeohZarr. I played the same song, and kept it at the same volume level. These Earfun earbuds were way lower than the other two I tried and with very little bass. And, the Earfun's cost more than the other two I have. For me Juckbo's are the best (only 3 stars on Amazon) which makes me question reviews on here. They have great volume and good bass, fit in my ear well and helps seal out outside noise. I have had trouble with the charging case, and they don't last the longest, to be honest. Next, closely behind are the PeohZarr. Good volume and decent bass. Volume is slightly lower than Juckbos as the same with the bass...but they are smaller than the Juckbo's. My biggest gripe with the PeohZarr's is they don't fit as nicely as the Juckbos and to fast foward a song you have to hold for 2 secs vs pressing the right ear bud 2x fast. When your running or climbing a stair master it's annoying to have to hold for 2 secs---(Juckbos and most ear buds you press 2x). Hope you like my review...I've tried 5 earbuds over the last 1 staying under $50 and currently have 3---soon to be just 2."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-26,A deal you don’t want to pass up!,"Wow! These are awesome! The clarity in sound on both ends are amazing! I am supper excited that I made this purchase, that I am buying my best friend a set for Christmas!! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-27,Great buy!,These are so awesome! It’s very clear and sounds great! It’s comparable to AirPods
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-27,Good audio does not have to be expensive!!!!,Oh my goodness these are amazing. Someone at work stole the left bud to my bosesound sports...so I decided to pick up these and I cannot be happier. The battery life is insane and plus the charging is super quick. That's a huge plus for me. Also I like a little more bass's in my audio and these hit the spot. My only complaints is that I wish the case was a tiny bit sturdier. The top of it seems to wiggle back and forth a lot. I can't wait untill I see Earfun Free v2 on Amazon because im going to snag those so fast 😅😆
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-27,Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds,Very nice looking earbuds when you connect to Bluetooth is only less than 1 minute to connect the sound is very good as well. and the good things about this is not 100$ like apple is sailings
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-27,Very Very solid headphones!,"I am very impressed with these earphones
1st) The look of them has a sleek style and I like the way they fit in my ear. I tilted my head left to right to see if they would fall out while I am at the gym which is where most of the time I will be using these and they stayed in the entire time and did not move. 2) The sound quality from the little phones are real solid. The bass hits real well, no static noise in the background, and its real clear. I am very happy with these headphones! I am a gym rat and my beats by dre just stopped working and music in my ears are very important for me to stay in the zone and these are a great replacement."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-28,"Good sound quality, when it works.","It worked pretty well for most of the first day at the gym. When I was done with my workout it powered off by itself, but since I was done I didn't try to turn it on again. The next day I tried to turn it on and only one side would turn on, but it would not connect to my iPhone. It was fully charged but it wouldn't work. So it died after one day of use. I did not drop it and it didn't get wet or anything that could damage it. They are VERY slippery and easy to drop but stay pretty secure in your ear. 4-stars for sound quality. Found these via CNET. I would not buy again or recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-28,Great sound,Awesome product! Honestly saying I couldn’t be happier with this product.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-28,Good values,Good fit good sound good buy
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-28,"Functional, but needs better noise cancellation during phone calls","The liked this product. It’s very easy to set up, charges quickly, and has good sound... but where it fell short is when I used this device to talk to people on the phone. People heard too much background noise and found it difficult to understand me because of it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-28,Great budget earbuds,Great earbuds for the price! The mic isn't the best. Would love volume control on the buds but I get that's hard to do without in-line controls.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-28,Incredible value!,"These are amazing. The sound quality is pretty average, but the bass is there if you want it and the volume can actually get pretty loud. I feel like the sound profile is perfect for the intended uses of these, wearing them while being ""active"". The included rubber ear tips actually work for both decent sound and holding power. I usually switch my buds to comply foam, but I think i'll stick with the rubbers on these. I wear them in the shower all the time, no problems with waterproofing! The case is nice, showing it's charge status with 4 LEDs. USB-C is very appreciated here as I can just use my phone charger to charge the case. The buds fit snugly in their spots and always start charging right away for me. Connection is easy and they always pair right up when I remove them from the case. I have heard the left ear go out occasionally, but really only when I'm sitting next to my 2.4ghz router, which is probably causing interference. Generally I hear no interference. Only cons would be the left bud can't work independently if you are trying to stretch the batteries, it's a ""slave"" bud only. I'd pay a little more for the functionality for sure. So far battery life and charge speed has been good enough that this isn't really an issue though. I've been on the fence about truly wireless earbuds for a long time, instead using semi wireless earbuds for the much better battery life. I thought the case would be inconvenient and just be another thing to charge, but I've found it's actually more convenient as you don't necessarily have to bring a charger with you. The price was right with this and I'm glad I got them...these are the future!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-28,Great price!,"These are not PowerBeats Pro quality, but they are a tenth of the price. Only used twice."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-29,Excellent wireless earphone for the price,"I've been use this product for about weeks already, I am so happy to get them. Quality is excellent, sound is above standard quality, noise cancellation is also very good, fit is very good for me and battery life is also excellent. Really easy to pair with my android phone. No complains so far by now."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-29,Highly Recommended,"Very nice true wireless IEM’s. Especially when Amazon had them for less than $35, but the current price is still a bargain. Very balanced sound to my ears and they pair quite easily to multiple devices. As with many of these type of IEM’s, even ones triple the price, you cannot control the volume from the IEM itself. You can only control the volume with your phone or whatever device you are streaming from. This leads to a problem when listening to video on an Amazon Fire Stick. You cannot control the volume in that instance. I believe that you are stuck with the last volume level when you were streaming from your phone, etc.
If they had volume control I would give 5 stars, but because of that I give a solid 4 stars and are highly recommended."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-10-29,Could not create a good seal.,I tried all included tips and none of them created a good seal. The quality of the silicon/plastic is not very good and the earbuds are not very comfortable as a result. The volume on these earbuds are relatively no with very faint bass. I'm going to return these.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-29,slave,i dont like that the left earbud is a slave and there is no case strap
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-29,Satisfied customer,"Comfortable, great sound. First pair of noise cancelling headphones I have owned, but I could still hear things. They work great for what I wanted them for. Great but!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-29,The best audio device I had,"Excellent device. Pairs perfectly with my iPhone 11Pro. Does a perfect noise cancellation, good quality audio. No issues with battery life. Perfect performance handling phone calls"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-30,"Funny name, great buds.","Overall, these are a great value! Don’t sound as good as Bose but they’re pretty darn close. Fit well, isolate pretty well and have great battery life. Weird name....great product."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-30,Bass is good. Easy to pair.,I've had them for a few days now and I love them. I'll be using them for work tomorrow and they will get a true test then.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-30,"Seems good, but a lot of weird stuff happening with mine...","These earbuds sound fairly good for only $40. Not too overpowering on the bass, or treble. But I still recommend messing with equalizers to fit the music you listen to. But I've noticed that after these came into contact with water, weird stuff has heppened with them. After the hour the volume just completely tanked, could barely hear anything. But that cleared up in a few minutes. Just recently (about 2 months after the water contact) the volume has done it again and now the left earbuds is around have the volume of the right one. I have to set the volume to 100% I'm order for it to be heard. I managed to fix this, but only by tearing off the little mesh Infront of the speakers. So technically breaking the product."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-30,"Great quality, good sound, long battery","This is the absolute best option for such a relatively low price. Have yet to have either earbud run out of power, and when tucked away, they are always fully charged and the case has plenty of charge after."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-10-30,They slip out when moving alot,"They're just an alright product. They are water resistant and the sound is decent, but they slip out when actually doing moderate to rigorous activities. Wouldn't recommend them, but they're fine in all honesty. Maybe I'm just picky 😅"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-30,Amazing wireless earbuds.,This is a great wireless earbuds set. So easy to setup.sound quality is awesome. Noice cancellation is great. Battery is lot better than expected for this low price.it is also waterproof.I love these earbuds. Will recommend to my friends and family.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,has a good sound,is very clear sound; very good product for the price !.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,Very affordable earbuds with great sound quality.,"The sound quality is very good. The carrying case is more compact than it looks originally in picture. Pairing is super easy as you just have to put them out from the case. I like to sleep with music playing, but wired headphones are a bit difficult to do that with. I was hoping these would be a fantastic solution to that issue. Comfort wise these are extremely comfortable in my ears. Sound quality, these buds sound great and have good bass. I love how they seal in my ears to block out other sounds when I really want to jam out. Battery life/charging case, they seem to live up to the 6 hour life and i like that i can put them back in the case to get some extra charge. Wearable app, easy to navigate and like i can change some of the tap gestures. Overall a very product in this price range."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,Very happy with purchase,Sound quality is excellent. Great bang for your buck!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,Fun for your ears,"First impression - very nicely packaged, good quality charging case, earbuds feel solid and fit perfectly right out of the box. They paired with my Nokia 9 on the first attempt, no issues. Sound quality is surprisingly good. I wish there was a volume control, but using the phone to control the volume works ok. So far, so good!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,A well thought out offering from Earfun,"The Earfun Free do so much right and focus on what is important in true wireless earbuds (TWS). Just look at the features. USB-C, wireless charging, waterproof (IPX7), six hours use time... and this is all before getting to the comfort or sound. These are the first set of TWS that I could use straight out the box. The fit is amazing due its rounded shape and these are comfortable enough to use for their entire six hour battery life. No need to mess around trying to find the best eartips or fiddle around trying to get the best comfort and seal. They just work. If you're looking at the Earfun Free it is probably because you've read or seen a video about how good they are. That's what happened to me. I kept hearing from Youtubers and forums on Head-fi that the Earfun Frees are some of the bust TWS you can get under $100. They are not lying. I listen to a wide variety of music from classic rock to rap and almost everything in between. I've listen to Pink Floyd, Johann Johannsson, Neil Young, Miles Davis, Childish Gambino, and more. Everything sounds fantastic. The bass goes deep but is controlled enough not to interfere with the mids. The treble is clear and detailed without ever being harsh. Actual soundstage. Let me repeat that. Actual soundstage with accurate instrument separation. I've had a stable and reliable connection that surpasses all other TWS I've tried. There is no annoying blinking light every 3-5 seconds like other buds. The few nitpicks I've heard about these is there are no volume controls (there isn't), and that they do not support AptX. I learned after getting the Anbes 359 and these that codec should not be a deciding factor when purchasing TWS. There are so many factors to consider when purchasing a good set of wireless buds and codec is not one of them. Find a good set that puts sound quality before looks, a reliable connection over celebrity endorsement, and find a company that backs up their product with warranties and guarantees in case you are not satisfied. That is exactly what Earfun has done with the Free TWS."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,Amazing Headphones!,"Bought these headphones for work and various tasks around my house. All I can say is wow! Way better than any Bluetooth headphones I’ve had before. They’re comfortable, have great sound quality, and amazing battery life. I’m so happy I can use the headphones separately as well, which a lot of other headphones don’t use that feature. These are pretty neat, and I’m definitely in love with them. Great product. You won’t regret your purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,Amazing sound quality!!,"Way better than I was expecting!! Well worth’s the $$$!! Great combination of treble, miss and bass! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,Great Value,These work as great as the more expensive items. Love them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-31,"Well-balanced sound, good fit, great value!","There is not much to not like about these EarFun Free Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds with Wireless Charging Case. Fit is, of course, something that every individual will need to assess for themselves. For me, these fit right out of the box with (I believe) the medium-size ear tips. From the wireless charging case to the auto-pairing features this set is a winner, but the add the amazing sound coming out of these beauties. While some earbuds will overdo the bass these have a significant but clear amount of bass, well balanced with the mids and highs. I have turned off the EQ in my iPhone ioS settings because they simply do not need any adjustments or enhancements to improve their audio performance. The fit...I have worked out and run in these with absolutely no movement problems. Battery life is as advertised - good. The direct line-of-sight range is easily beyond what is advertised. No these are not high-end earbuds, but most audiofiles should be reasonblt pleased with these. I got these for 39.99 (special) but I'd be happy if I paid the regular price of 49.99 (even up to 79.99)."
EarFun,Free,3,0,2019-11-01,BOTH EARBUDS DO NOT WORK INDEPENDENTLY,"Only the right earbud can work independently (without the left) but the left can only work if the right one is on. This information IS in the item description and I should have read it (stupid me) but I didn't, and had I known I would NOT have purchased these. I got these to replace an even cheaper pair of knock-off AirPods that busted after only 2 months of use. I work long(ish) shifts (5-7 hours) in a warehouse without access to an electric outlet and grew pretty used to having one earphone in and when it died after about 5 hours putting it in the charge case and swapping it for the other for continuous listening. Other than that they work fine. For now. I don't expect them to crap out on me as soon as the last ones but we'll see."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,Nice Product,These Earbuds worked very well. used them while mowing and they cut the sound of the mower and the music sounded good.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,Great buy,"Great earphones. It feels like they last a long time, especially with the case. Great buy, I highly recommend it"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,Excellent quality earbuds,"I just got the earbud today .The packaging was incredible, the build quality is top notch, and an amazing set of features for the price even if the price was twice as high. Wireless charging, waterproofing and bluetooth v5.0 are just a few of the high end features this earbud offers.Pairing them with my phone was too easy."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,nice,"these are my first wireless ear buds,so i can't compare with anything;but i like them and very good for the price!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,Great product. Satisfied customer,very easy to pair with your phone (I have a note 10+). Sound is great. Can't comment on the battery life because I haven't use them longer than 3 hours (I only use my ear buds at work). They comfortably fit in my ears. I'm satisfied w/the purchase though.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,Works well,They are great for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,Great value.,Only had for a few days but they have a good sound Quality and work well with my iPhone. Easy Bluetooth connection and great price point. Easy to carry case is a plus.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-01,"Great product, reasonable price.","Love these! This is my first pair of completely wireless, the only thing I'd like to see change in future models, would be the ability to use each earbud separately. I use them primarily for streaming video on my iPad and typically only use one at a time. Otherwise, perfect! I've already recommend them to friends."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-01,Good for the price,"Average bluetooth buds, giving it 4 stars for its extra feats(wireless charging usb c) sound is average nothing spectacular but it works as intended. You can only use right bud if you want to single ear listening. Mic is a little low on the pick up side you have to speak up a bit. Battery life is decent and its up to par with what the manufacturer claims"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-02,Fell out of ears,Would not stay in my ears
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-02,Pretty freaking good,"11/2/19 i have used them for just a few hours so far. As of now i have no complaints at all. I've listened to music, watched a movie and talked on them. So far well worth the money I paid. Be back for a 30 day review"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-02,"Great soundstage, comfort, quality","Good, quality, premium product that is very comfortable, has 3 size tips, though I prefer the smallest as I wear them at work and am not looking for total isolation. Great charger and use of magnets to secure them in the case. I am surprised by the soundstange and separation these offer considering it is blutooth. Would highly recommend as a good neutral /analytic pair. I use it almost all day for listening to audiobooks, broadway cast recordings and music."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-02,Pleasantly surprised!!,"I am honestly surprised how much I like these earbids! I have had many many types since they were invented because I listen to a lot of audiobooks. I didn't think I would like this kind, but they are comfortable and easy. I keep with my iPad. The only downside is that they do not work with my LG phone."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-03,Top Tier,This is an affordable and nice looking ear buds. It comes with chargeable case. I try to compare it to Samsung and Apple Brand product and it is way cheaper than those big brand. I was listening music for few days and sound quality is good. The battery stays for few days and with Easy pairing process.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-03,Great product and customer service,Great true wireless earbuds and the customer support has been excellent! Thank you Earfun
EarFun,Free,4,0,2019-11-03,Fit and finish can't be beat for this price!,"This is a fantastic price for the quality. They fit in my ears nicely. I am very impressed and so happy to have upgraded! Seriously,these are very well made and the built in features are really convenient,simple and sleek. I am also told that as I was talking with a friend on the hands free mic, while driving down the road with my windows down,that my voice came through crystal clear with zero wind interference. So,I couldn't be happier with this. And as a bonus it was a bday gift to me!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-03,"Great earbuds, can’t find appropriate phone replacement tips.","Hi. This is my second or third pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds. The reviews were great, particularly about the sound. I generally enjoy foam earbud tips instead of the silicone ones which come with these kinds of products. So I ordered two different sets thinking that one would separate itself from the other. I tried one set on in the sound was absolutely amazing once I put the foam tips on these earbuds. The problem is that when I took the earbuds off, the tips were stuck in my ears and I needed to have someone remove them with the tweezers. Evidently, the diameter of the connection point on the tips is too big for the place where they should be attached on these buds. Is there another set of foam chip replacements which will fit on this product? Otherwise, I have to return them, disappointingly. Thanks."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-03,Best for the money.,"The best earbuds for the money period. Great sound quality even better than some of the supposed high end headphones. They connect almost instantly and the battery life is amazing. Charged them when I got them and have been using them for a week, the case still has full charge."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-11-03,Great,good quality could be louder but not bad for the price
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-03,Excellent quality and price.,"Always trying to reduce weight and bulk while traveling I wanted to try some true wireless earbuds. Normally I do not use earbuds because I found wired ones snagged and fell out or produced annoying noises as I walked. I have been totally surprised by these. They pair and operate exactly as advertised. They fit my ears comfortably and isolate sound well. The sound is very well rounded if used with the equalizer in my favourite Power Amp music player or through an equalizer app for other apps that don't have an equalizer. I found I needed an equalizer when streaming Amazon music. That's not saying they don't sound fine on their own, I just find the sound is even better when enhanced. Though it states these buds are noise-canceling, that only applies to calls when mic is active. Someone can correct me if I am wrong on this. Battery life seems exactly as advertised and the charging case means you don't have to charge them as often. I give these buds 4 stars, the extra star would come if they had a volume control. Over all, excellent value for the money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-03,Great ! Ear piece...,"I gave it 5 star because it is just as described and for me works great. Remember this if you have a small ear It's not going to look good due to it's not that small even do I really like them and it fits me perfect and the quality , sound and the nice cancellation are excellent !! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-03,Compact headphones with good quality of voice,"i like this product very much. Very much comfortable to carry, chargeable anywhere. Sound quality is good. size is compact. battery life i did not check and could be good i feel."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-04,Impressed with the buds and build quality,"Definitely worth the buy, battery last forever it’s not going to be an issue. They fit snug and won’t fall off. I am impressed with the build quality and They perform like a 150$ airpods. I loved the sound clarity of the buds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-04,Amazing build quality and durable,Awesome feel when you first take the earphone in hand. The case seems pretty sturdy and feels premium. Tested it while jogging and also while playing football. It doesn't fall off. I didn't have to worry about it at all while running. Really great product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-04,Snug fitting earbuds in a very tiny case.,I bought these for myself after finding another one that I have to be very bulky. These are MUCH better. The earpeiece is contoured better to fit into the ear cartilage. The sound quality is great and the software seems to pair more reliably than my other one. I also like it since it comes in a smallest wireless charging case that will vanish in your pocket.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-04,Great design -- these are a clear winner in their price range!,"These are outstanding! They tick all the right boxes:
- Great battery life! I use headphones/earbuds all day at work, and don't want to be hassling with recharging them every 2-3 hours like with previous generations of fully-wireless earbuds. The USB-C + Qi charging case is ideal for me, as I my phone uses those same charging methods. Charging the buds for 10 minutes provides 2 more hours of use... that's pretty amazing! - Much better sound than you'd expect for the price -- they don't match my $200 over-the-ears, but they're the best-sounding wireless earbuds I've tried. FWIW, all my previous ones have been more-conventional designs, like the Anker Soundcore models with the ear hook. These have a smooth, pleasing sound profile -- well-balanced, with a wider soundstage than you often get with earbuds. - IPX7 water resistance! I love that... I can wear them on my bike ride home, then hop right into the shower and keep listening. - Good fit -- comfortable, and no issues with them dropping out. Extremely light, you barely notice they're in. - Good seal -- above-average passive noise cancellation, below-average wind noise on my bike. - Rock-solid tech: BT 5.0, quick & stable connection, easy assistant access. - Subtle styling! Most of the other wireless buds I was looking at have weird design features: conspicuous designs printed on them, blue or red LEDs, etc. These are a nice, elegant matte black... just right. I don't want to look like a cyborg, I just want to listen to my music & podcasts. Nothing's perfect, but there are no deal breakers here. Minuses:
- Larger than some truly wireless buds... but they don't feel too loud, and they're definitely featherweight. I'd rather have them this size than smaller but with worse battery life. - No volume controls on the buds -- not a big deal, since I wear my phone in a holster that allows easy volume access... or I can double press the R earbud to get Google Assistant, and ask it to set a specific volume."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-05,Horrible,Horrible product. Only one earbud would sync up. There is no volume botton so your stuck on one volume level and it's not loud at all
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-05,Great Product!,"Wow, these are sweet headphones. USB C, wireless charging, water resistant. Paired to my phone easily and worked without issues. Easy recommendation to all my friends."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-05,Dissatisfied- Broken Already,They appear to be broken already less than a week after purchasing them. The left earbud puts out barely any sound compared to the right. Disappointed.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-05,Great!,Best relation cost x benefit
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,USB- c and wireless charging capable,This is the only earphone that I found with USB-C and wireless charging capability. All the other comes with the usual USB port. The quality and the noise canceling is superb.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,Just Excellent! I mean it!,"Disclaimer: I purchased these earbuds from Amazon. I paid full price; no coupons, no discounts. This is my honest, very positive review on an excellent product. I have had several sets of earbuds; wired, wireless and now two pair of true wireless, all in the $30 to $130 range. These don't have all of the features of the most recent higher dollar pair, but those that are missing turned out to be of little or no value. Sometimes you wind up paying too much for things you will never or very seldom use. The fit is excellent. With the medium ear cushions provided I am able to hear enough outside sound to be safe, and if I pay close attention, carry on a conversation. The large cushions, at least for me, cut our all outside sounds, period. Of course your experience is going to depend on the size of your ear canals. Both pairs are extremely comfortable. I was afraid the lack of volume buttons on the earbuds would be a problem, but as it turns out, using Siri to adjust the volume turned out to be a big plus when you take into account all the other things she is useful for and how easy it is to get her attention. It turned an anticipated worry of mine into a distinct positive. Sound is clear and crisp. Treble is very good and bass is excellent. Mid-range sound is clear and not muddy in any way. Whereas volume on my other earbuds was ""loud enough"", there is more volume here than I will ever need. I like having the choice. Battery life seems to be endless. I have used them for extended periods, some nearly 5 hours non-stop and still had plenty left. I have charged them in the case several times and not recharged the case. It still shows three of the four charge lights. Amazing. The case is very small, much smaller than the others I have had, and very easy to carry in my pants pocket
The only teeny negative I have found is as others have mentioned, the buds are a little slippery and sometimes more difficult to get our of the case than I would like, but as I said, in the over all picture this little problem amounts to nothing or less. After many tries, some very acceptable earbuds, some near misses, and one set that was terrible, I believe I have found some real keepers. These earbuds, their operation and overall quality are suburb. In my experience, I don't believe you will find will not find anything near the price even comes close. No need to say more. If you want excellent true wireless earbuds, here are them... Honest!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,Highly recommend!,These sound and work really well. Comparing to galaxy buds these arent far off especially for the price!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,Perfect out of the box,"Was exactly what I was looking for. Paired immediately, handles my workouts and provides great sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,Excellent Value for the Price Point,"I've had these for just over one month and they are excellent. They come with three sizes of soft rubber tips, so you are bound to get a great fit. They rest in my ears nicely and never cause any discomfort. They don't fall out easily, even when using them at the gym. Despite not being sound cancelling they work well as earplugs. I fly quite a bit and they make the background noise on a plane much quieter, even when I'm not playing any sound through them. They charge fast in the case and the battery life is really good. I've only ever had them notify me of low battery twice since I always keep them in the case when not actively listening to something. The case fits in my pocket and while it is noticeable, it isn't uncomfortable. These are a great and very affordable option rather than spending a ton of money on one of the major brands."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-07,Great value,"Great sound. Easy to pair with good base, and noise canceling. My granddaughter loves these. Plus moisture does not ruin them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-07,Pleasantly surprised.,Pretty surprising for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-08,Great product,Arrived very fast... Can't wait to try them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-09,Amazing,"Great Value, way better than AirPods. Good case and overall build"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-09,Best in price range.,Love these. Sound quality is great. Best in price range especially for the additional features.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-10,Not too shabbsss,Surprised by the sound these put out! Was looking for the switch from apple. Not disappointed.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-11-10,Great for music but terrible for calls....,"Overall: Great for listening to music but terrible for calls. Sound: They sound great! They have a pretty nice and even sound stage with a slight emphasis on the bass. The mids and highs are clear even when turned up and with the bass kicking pretty hard. I wouldn't mind slightly crisper highs but are pretty good considering I am not using any apps or EQ of any kind. They sound a lot like a few good pairs of 3.5mm wired headphones I used to use and miss. Calls: Hearing others is not an issue however others hearing you is a problem. Every time I used these for calls I would have to switch to using the handset or speakerphone because every time people would say my voice was breaking up and not clear. Fit: They fit really well and feel light and comfortable. At first I almost put them in upside down but then realized how they go in and they fit great. Because most of the bulk sits up higher it feels like it helps push them down into your ears and helps them stay in. Comparing to others that have the same design as the AirPods where they go out and down, the EarFuns feel much more comfortable and stable. Controls: The controls for these are buttons on the outside. When pressing the buttons it is easy to press the earphone into your ear and cause discomfort. I think this is the only downside. It would be great if it was touch, or if the button was on the bottom or somewhere there you can grip/press it using 2 fingers that didn't involve pressing into your ear. Even with this design if you use a finger to support the earphone while you press the button it is not terrible. Issues: The only thing I noticed that happened a few times is the left and right didn't start playing the song at the exact same time occasionally. Right would start and left would start 0.5 seconds after. Definitely not a deal breaker."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-10,Awesome,I love them
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-10,Ok for the money...,"These are nice earbuds. The fit is ok for smaller ears. However, the piece that sticks out of the ears is larger than most. Ok for the money otherwise"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-10,Great Battery Life,"These headphones work really well for the price. They sound good and pairing was simple. Battery life is great as well. I get some ear fatigue after about 2 hours of listening. Also some times the volume spikes for a second. Not enough to hurt your ears, but noticeable."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-10,Good Sound Quality,"The sound quality is really good in comparison with price and it paired with my Iphone 6 as well. The only thing that I had struggle with was how to pair them with phone for the first time. You need to take them off from the case and then click on the Bluetooth device to get paired. if they are in the case, the won't pair with your phone. I like them so far."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-11,Nice Product. Great Value for the $,"Time to Update my original 1* review. The company did respond to my support request. I believe they must be providing support from Asia since all the responses came in the middle of the night, US time. I tried a reset as shown in the video link provided. Still not working. I returned to Amazon since I really had invested more time than you should have to. Ear Fun decided to send me a free replacement even though they knew I had been refunded by Amazon. Kudos to them for this type of service effort. I decided that this type of effort on their part should be acknowledged so I decided to try the replacements. Easy pairing and connection on the first try and additional tries. The sound is good but not great. A little heavy on the bass. There's no equalizer controls or app. However, keep in mind the price point and the sound is not bad, just not great. Phone calls seemed to be fine. No complaints from either side of the few calls I've done so far. Volume is strong. The fit is good. They seemed secure on the treadmill and were comfortable though not as comfortable as my way more expensive Jaybird earbuds. There was a selection of different size earbuds included. The case is very nice. USB-c charging is a pleasant surprise at this price. The case is compact. A lot smaller than others I've tried at this price. The lid closes securely and opens easily. The hinge is large enough that I'm not concerned about dropping and breaking it. The buds fit securely in the case. However, taking them out seems a little awkward for some reason. LEDs on the front show the current charge level of the case. The battery life of the earbuds is on par with what's stated. I haven't used them long enough to drain the battery in the case. The controls on the earbuds work very well. They're physical controls and if you use the correct number of taps/holds they respond as documented. There's no volume control on the earbuds themselves which is disclosed. You can easily summon Google Voice Assistant (and Siri I guess-no Apple for me) to adjust the volume. When you consider the price point of these earbuds, You are getting a lot for your $. If you're an audiophile, look elsewhere. If you want some decent sounding earbuds to workout in these are a nice choice. Original Review
Took delivery of the earbuds today. ""Pairing"" to my Pixel 3a was simple. However not really. The earbuds would never ""connect"" rendering the earbuds useless. Re-paired at least 10 times and could never get them to connect. The buds would always be in ""pairing"" mode and would never connect. There were no instructions on how to reset but I think I figured that out with no change in behavior. Sent an email off to the manufacturer as there's no phone support. No response to the email within 8 hours-not even an automated reply. I tried to pair the buds to a different phone- MOTO G6. After about 10 attempts I did get a connection. However the left earbud didn't provide any sound. Ensured that yes, they were turned on. Oh and the sound from the right earbud was tinny. There was no selection of earpieces-one size fits all-or not. The fit wasn't too bad. Lastly, while the earbuds slip firmly into the case, they are a little awkward getting out and I had a lot of practice in a few hours. On the positive side, they use USB-c charging which is unexpected at this price point. What is expected though is a working pair of earbuds. Back they go..."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-12,Great sound,They sound great but battery life not so good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-12,Awesome Earbuds,Amazing sound quality and really comfortable to wear. I must say it has long battery life too. Highly recommend earbuds! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-12,Good sound quality and battery life,These work great and very reasonable price.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-12,"Overall good, hard to grip when taking out of ears and case so may make you prone to dropping them","I like these headphones. They don't fall out when running. Don't hurt my ears if they are in for a long time and they have good sound quality. The only drawbacks are they are a little bulky, and when i take them out of the case and out of my ears they are hard to grip and I have dropped them a few times. Other than that, a good buy."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-12,"Fragile case, not heavy bass, weak battery life!","The earbuds are not bad, just ok! The case feels frail and fragile. People claim they have ""bass"", don't be fooled. The bass is not that great and it rattles at high volume... The battery is weak! It claims in the description 30 hours. Nope, more like 3.5 before it starts telling you it has low battery. I start work at 5:30am and I start using headphones as soon as I start work. Nonstop music and podcast. By 8:50 am I was getting ""battery low"" message...one thing is the distance I was from my phone before headphones start cutting out is amazing.... overall they are just ok...if you're into heavy bass music, stay clear from these. But if you don't care about sound quality or don't care about bass then these are fine!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-12,Not very loud,"I’ve had them for about a week, and noticed the sound is a bit lower then any of my wired generic EarPods. I don’t know if this happened after I tried out the waterproof function, or if it’s been like this all along. I’ve done the reset steps and it didn’t help. I listen to my music on 10/10 volume, these are about a 8.5/10 compared to other headphone brands."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-13,These Earfun buds are awesome!,These little buds are great! I was honestly surprised with the sound quality!! And the case was much smaller and portable than I thought. They pair super quick to my phone as soon as I take them out of the case and disconnect as soon as I put them back in their case. I love the fact that these have USB C charging port and the wireless charging is the cherry on top! They come with the USB C cable. Even though I haven has to use the chargers yet since I've had them for a little over a week and I haven't had to charge them yet.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-13,Left Bud,"Consistently with two pair, the left bud failed to sync with my iPhone."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-13,Good earbuds for $40,"Got these for $40 and I'm surprised by the quality. I charge these once a week and last for several hours per charge. Only complaints are that the case is a little bulky and that only the right earbud can be used outside of the case. This is annoying for me as I like to use my left ear more often so I might have to return these because of this. Otherwise, great earbuds for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-13,Great for the price,"Sound quality is not bad, and they’re quite comfortable. They were easy to set up and pair. I tried them on a loud train and it did a good job of blocking out noise. Ok, now that i've had them for longer, they're really really nice. No issues after several weeks of use!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-13,like the little case,"Comfortable, easy to connect with bluetooth, store, and sound quality was fine."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-11-14,"Function A+++, Appearance C-",I felt like frankenstein wearing these... they were bulky looking. Function was great on them however.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-14,A variety of music sounds good with these earbuds,"I own two Earfun speakers, so I decided to give their earbuds a shot. I’ve never been the biggest fan of earbuds, but thought I could use these on my daily walks. The buds came charged at 90% and easily paired right out of the box. I was quickly listening to music. I tested them by listening to a variety of music like Dave Matthews, Paul Davis, Disturbed, Al Green, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and the sound was very pleasing, with a decent amount of bass. All these genres of music sounded good to my ear. The charging case is cool. You drop the earbuds in to charge them. Couldn’t be easier. Bluetooth range is very good. I had my device in a living area and went about 50 feet into a corner of a bedroom and the buds stayed connected.. This is my first time experiencing the convenience of wireless earbuds. I can see why folks really enjoy them. I like the price point as well. This is another great product from Earfun."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-14,Great earbuds and good sound quality,Good sound quality!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-14,Unstable connection issues,"First of all, I really wanted to like this pair of earbuds. There's a lot of good things to like about this product. I would easily give this product 5stars if it wasn't for the unstable connection. Pros
Sound quality is great for this price. Battery life is also better than many wireless earbuds. Build quality doesn't feel cheap. USB C and wireless charging makes it a better value than most earbuds out there
Cons:
I've only had this pair for two days, and I've already experience around 4 times where the left earbud(slave) randomly disconnects, or won't even connect to the right earbud(master). I've always had to turn them off and on just to reconnect them properly. within two days, I've already had a lot of experience where both earbuds have choppy connections. They claim that this product have ""ULTRA STABLE CONNECTION"" because of Bluetooth 5. However, I've had two older bluetooth headphones with bluetooth 4.0 and I don't even remember having choppy connection in either of them. Having a stable connection is very important for me. I listen to music to relax me from all the stresses from school and work, but listening to choppy music just makes me more annoyed and stressed out. I've tried to unpair/pair them to fix issue, but it will become choppy again later on. I can't just unpair/pair these earbuds everytime I'm experiencing this issue because it happens too often. Because of this, I will drop my ratings from 5 stars to 1 star. I don't know if this is a common problem with other customers, if so, then this is a really huge deal breaker. If it isn't common, maybe they just sent me a defective pair. UPDATE
I changed my review to 5 stars again after they reach out to me and sent a new pair of earbuds. the new earbuds isn't as bad as it my first one but I still get some choppiness between the two earbuds. I think this is common since the left earbud always has to sync with the right one."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-14,"Spotty connection in outside busy locations, otherwise good","It's been a couple of years since I bought new wireless earbuds in hopes that the bluetooth technology has improved, but alas it has not. If you plan on using these in a busy city, e.g. NYC, be prepared for the bluetooth connection to be spotty and cut in and out frequently. When not using out in the streets, it performs just fine. The extended battery life and wireless charging are pluses and a major reason why I purchased as well, hopefully the technology improves in time...
UPDATE: After 1 month of use, I've reduced to 1 star, the signal breaks up so frequently outdoors it's almost unusable. I guess quality is sacrificed for battery life..."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-15,Do not buy. Product not worth the money.,Do not buy. Unit stopped charging and won't charge anymore. And I can't return it because it happen 31 days after owning it.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-15,Usb C and Qi wireless charging set these earbuds apart from similarly priced earbuds!,"I just got an iPhone 11 and the cost of Apple AirPod Pro earbuds for $250 was insane! After much research I decided on the Earfun True Wireless earbuds... I’m very happy with my decision. Great earbuds! Sound great with movies on iPhone. Music sounds great too. Plenty of bass! I get about 5 hours on a charge listening to talk radio. The fully charged case will recharge earbuds 4 more times. I watched Avengers Endgame, a 3 hour and 11 minute movie, and had no problem at all. Movie sounded great! The best features I like the most are the usb “c” charge port and especially the wireless Qi charging capability. These two features alone separate these earbuds with all similarly priced earbuds anywhere! Takes around 30-45 minutes to charge on my Yootech Qi charger. I highly recommend these Earfun TRULY wireless earbuds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-15,Killer base and actually waterproof (shower proof),"The bass on these earphones is super super strong and I was really surprised at how good it sounded. They are also somewhat noise canceling, I wouldn't say that they eliminate all the noise, but it does reduce outside noise drastically. They fit nice and snug in the ear, but after a while, they did start to hurt my ear. I might just need to change the size earplug I'm using. I did wear them in the shower to test the waterproof claim. The water made the snug fit not as strong when the water got into the ear and broke the seal (seal of contact between my ear and the earphone) and I noticed the right one would fall out often. The right earphone did stop working in the shower, I'm not sure if it was due to the water or if the battery just died? I dried them off after the shower and put them back in the case to charge and when I went to use them later it was working again. So I'm not sure what to make of that, I hadn't charged them since taking them out of the package so it was likely just the battery. The only thing I'm don't really care for is how far they stick out of the ear, but that isn't affecting the quality or anything, just a personal preference. Overall super impressed."

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-16,Good earbuds,"I have been using this ear buds for a week now. It serves my purpose well. Good sound, ease of use and rechargeable case help me. I have also tried using it while playing pubg and these is no latency in sound."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-16,"Incredible for the price, great for audio, unusable for video","Honestly, I am blown away by these earbuds, and especially for the price! I've always detested in ear earbuds because they'd make my ears hurt or sounded awful, but these don't hurt and sound incredible. You simply cannot watch video with them because of the latency, but for me just listening to music at work or at home, they're great. More details:
The good:
- Sonically, they are on par with my ATH-M40x headphones, that have been my reference for audio quality. Probably not up to an audiophile's standards, but for my slightly more picky self, they are outstanding. Great bass if you're into that sort of thing. Also important is that they don't hurt my ears sonically, and you can listen for an extended period of time without fatigue. Very flat sound so you can adjust it with your device's EQ to your preference. - Fit my ears well, even though my ears are on the smaller side. I do have to fiddle with them to get a proper fit and seal but once I do they are great. - Noise cancellation is good, it should be described as noise isolation, however, because it's all passive. But after you get a good deal you won't hear much of anything outside. - Battery life is very good, I'll use them for hours and they'll still have battery to spare, and the case/charger holds a good deal of charge. And it uses a USB C charger! I don't need another charger other than the one for my phone! Have not tried the wireless charging. - They look pretty decent. They stick out about a third of an inch from my ears which I'm not thrilled by, but it's much better than I was expecting. From the side it looks very nice. They have the word ""earfun"" embossed onto the side, which I don't like because I hate having any logos visible on my electronics, but it's not too obvious to others. - The case is pretty compact and feels pretty decently made. There is a magnet that keeps the case closed and feels very secure. It looks pretty nice and quality too. There are light indicators on the front that light up when you open/close the case to tell you the charge level. After a few weeks of use the lid does feel a little less snug in that I can slightly shift it from side to side, but it still feels good. - I have been told that on a call I sound like I'm on a really good speakerphone and I'm very clear, so I think that's good? The bad:
- There is no way to let in background noise, like on the Galaxy buds for example. Since I use these mainly at work, I need to be able to hear other people if they come up from behind me, but it's completely isolated. I would be very hesitant to wear them when walking around a city, for example, or when using public transportation. - Sometimes they will fail to pair correctly, leading to only the right earbud having choppy audio, even though the left one says it's paired up. You then have to make your phone forget the pairing, turn them off, reset the earbuds, and then reconnect them. Also, and this is not really stated in the manual except for in the troubleshooting, you have to turn them on at the exact same time. The majority of the time paring will work without a hitch, however, and pairing is very fast. - The controls are a physical button that you have to press on to use, instead of just tapping like on other (more expensive) true wireless earbuds. It can be uncomfortable since you're then pressing the earbud into your ear more. There is also no volume control on the earbud. Also, the majority of the controls like skip forward and back are on the left earbud, and as a right handed person, it is much less intuitive. Plus if you decide to only use the right earbud and keep the left in the case, you can only do play and pause on the right. - While they are very comfortable to wear for extended durations, I have on occasion gotten ""too good"" of a seal, and it feels like a vacuum on my eardrums until I move them around. The ugly:
- Completely unacceptable latency. You simply cannot watch video with these, and definitely could not game with them. Probably a good half second or more delay. You can also notice a latency between the two earbuds on phone calls, where one earbud will be slightly behind the other. I even turned off AAC and tried out settings on my (Android) phone to try and reduce it, but it has not reduced at all. Bottom line: for music they are incredible. For video they are 100% unusable. My rating for them for just listening to music is 5 stars. For video it's 0 stars."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-16,Awesome,Very good earbud stays in your ear does not move easy to operate long battery life.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-16,On the larger side,"They did not fit my ears well and were rather painful to wear. I'm a 5'9"" male and dont rewlly think my ears are avg size. The sound was pretty good considering the price but useless to me. I'm returning mine"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-16,Too bulky...,"It’s a decent product for the price. However, the earbuds were too bulky for my ear, which made it a bit uncomfortable. Would love to try their earbuds again if they come out with a smaller version (with touch control)."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-16,Amazing,Love these headphones! Work great. Amazing value
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-17,Great sound for the money,A little bit bigger than I expected but great sound. The battery only lasts for about 5 hours but there are plenty of wireless earbuds that are way more expensive with the same battery life. The sound quality was great.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-18,Cheap earbuds that are more than worth their price,"These earbuds were the third pair that I tried, after the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air (not enough bass and isolation) and JLab Air Sport (great bass, not enough of anything else). Their isolation is amazing, so much that I can't hear anything except extremely loud noises and wind when they're on. Sound is great; bass is strong, punchy, and well rounded, and mids and highs are well-defined. Higher-range sounds that demand more clarity are not as clear or warm as they should be (cymbals and hi-hats sound tinny), and vocals are not these buds' strong suit (""s"" sounds are hissy). My only real gripe is that they can get a bit uncomfortable after an hour, but fit is different for everyone. Definitely try these out!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-18,Great product,Great and easy to use. Perfect for the gym! I love it .
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-18,Awesome earbuds for a great price.,Awesome earbuds for a great price. These sound as good as ones that over twice the price. A definite great value and great buy. I would purchase them again and won't ever regret doing so.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-18,Good for the money!,"Only thing that wasn't really good was battery life, otherwise these are good for the money!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-18,Not bad,Not bad at all.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-18,Great value and sound. Highly recommend.,"It is always hard to know how a set of earbuds will sound (fit, bass response, etc). My initial impression is that they sound outstanding! Especially for the price. I f you like the smiley face eq settings these are great. I think the sound as good if not better than the airpods I replaced. I haven't had long enough to really know battery but my guess is that it is good. Great value!"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-11-18,Would have loved these if they had not stopped working,"They barely lasted a month of me hardly using them. One earbud turned on and would not turn back on, rendering the pair useless. They were easy to pair while they lasted, and very comfortable. I just wish they had, you know, worked."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-18,Great Earbuds for workout,"Great Earbuds for workout ,fits nicely, does not fall and great battery life . Easy to charge."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-19,Nice,"I am now a believer of wireless earphones. My first fear was that these would fall off easily, but they don't. Second, these would be too loud; they aren't because volume isn't controlled by the earphones (which I appreciate). These pieces are convenient to use as they charge when you put them back in the case (charging pad not included). My only minor wish was that it had more bass, but aside from that, I'll be using these earphones habitually!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-19,Comfortable and Good Sound Quality.,"These are comfortable to wear when working out. They do not fall out even when doing cardio fitness exercises. I like how there are 3 different sized ear pieces you can use because everyone's ears are different. The case they come in is nice and protects them n top of charging them. I can use the cord that came with them or the one that came with my cell phone. They were very easy to pair to my phone as well. I do wish there was more bass in the sound, but other than that, they are a good wireless earbud."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-19,Give these a try,Sleek case and good functionality. Multiple features for use with phone and for music. Fits well and comfortable for the ears.
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-11-19,Simply superb,"I bought these earbuds for me, but I let my roommate try them, and I think we'll be fighting over them now because we both love them. We've actually each used one separately so I had one paired to my phone and he had one paired to his phone, and they worked great."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-20,Beyond price,"Slim and reliable product. Easy to setup. Battery life is fantastic. I haven’t charged them till today and used them all day in office since I received. Very comfortable, just like that sits in the ear. Sound quality is good. Overall loved the product..."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-20,Great quality at low cost,"Gotta say I like these ear plugs and think they are a good value at $50. Sound quality is very good -- I played Pink Floyd's ""Wish you were here"" -- and was surprised to hear faint voices I normally never hear on the radio or my home stereo. Pretty amazed by that. The ear plugs are not noise cancelling but fit well and diminish outside sound to a surprising degree. I even like the battery case which charges the plugs when you are not wearing them. Good item!"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-20,Only right earbud will pair 🙄,"Only the right earbud pairs, even after resetting the earphones as suggested online. The sound quality on the one that works is good for the price."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-20,Good quality earbuds,I bought these to use with speech therapy phone app. They work well and have good sound. I wish there was an option to get them in a smaller size. I am using the smallest earbud insert but it is still slightly too large so I can only use them for short periods of time. They are a good quality and hold a charge longer than I expected.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-20,Solid earbuds with connectivity issues,"Good fit, nice sound, solid battery life. One drawback: I've found that sometimes only 1 earbud will connect and I need to re-insert the buds into the case to 'cycle' them. Usually the second attempt is successful. Email support was above average on this issue."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-20,As good as the name brand ones!,I ordered these as a Christmas gift for one of my kids because I didn’t want to spend more on the name brand item and have them break/lose them. I opened them to test before Christmas and the sound quality is great and so far the battery is too. They actually stay in my ears better and are comfortable to wear. These work just as well as the name brand ones (which I own as well)for a lot less price.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-21,Bad Laptop Connectivity,"The sound cancellation on these earphones is the best I've experienced in earphones. The sound quality is also pretty great and the convenience and comfort of these earphones have me using them constantly. The only problem that I've had is that they start acting up the moment I connect them to my laptop. They'll be fine for about half an hour and then the sound will start cutting out. Sometimes, from only the left earphone, sometimes completely. There have also been some occasions where the earphones will disconnect from my laptop entirely. This is a problem for me because I'm on my laptop pretty often for school. I haven't had any problems with them connecting to my phone though. The battery will also occasionally give wrong percentage readings. It will say 60% and then the earphones will be dying 30 minutes later,"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-21,Far better optios,"Pros:
1. Good price
2. Nice looking product
3. Great battery life. 4. Easy set-up & connectivity
Cons:
1. Noise cancelling nonexistent
2. Sound quality, nothing impressive. 3. Plastic feel, doesnt look durable
Bought this for quick 45-60 minute flights and quickly realized they are completely useless. Even at max volume, I struggled to get clear audio from a Netflix movie on flights. Bass like any form of noise cancelling is also nonexistent. I didn't do any further testing as they were unsuitable for the reason I purchased them. My son now is the proud owner of these."
EarFun,Free,4,0,2019-11-15,Nice sound,Nice sound and easy to use
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-15,"Great audio quality, comfy fit - good value","I really enjoyed these punchy earbuds. The sound quality is delightful, and they fit securely. Their design is especially perfect for my ears - the long sound canal kinda twists and locks into place within your ear. I can work outside or exercise without fear of losing them or them getting loose. Of course, the USB-C port is fantastically convenient! The case, while a bit bulky, is still carryable, with clear battery level indicators and a solid magnetic lid. I also liked the variety of size rubber tips and the solid water resistance. Best of all? Actual physical buttons to control the buds. With the well-designed buds, they don't push into your ears when pressing the buttons, either. I do wish they had made the buds both able to work independently, but the battery life is good enough, I don't really mind. A solid purchase for its price!"
EarFun,Free,3,0,2019-11-14,Good sound quality for listening music or audio books. Microphone is subpar.,"Very good battery life and good sound quality for listening music and audio books in general. Bluetooth connection is quite stable, only occasional (rarely) dropoff for one side (usually the left side) but connect back up soon after. But I have used it in a number of occasions for conference calls or just normal voice calls that people complained that they could barely hear me even though I was close to shouting. So I gave up on using it for nothing more than just listening to music and audio books."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-13,I'm in Love,"I was going to wait at least a few weeks to write a review, but I couldn't help myself. These came last week and I've been using them every day since. They shipped very fast and were packaged very well. SUPER EASY to set up on iphone 11. Just turn on BlueTooth on your phone, take the buds out and they automatically start to pair with your phone. They came almost fully charged as well, so were ready to use right away. Each bud works and has the same sound and same volume coming out of each of them. These are not Bose sound quality, BUT the sound quality is excellent and the base is good and sufficient for what I listen too. I am sooo glad (so far) that I didn't shell out $100 or more for wireless earbuds when these are more than sufficient. Especially since they are so small and can realistically be dropped and get lost easily. Thank goodness for the magnetic charging case, but they are slippery little suckers, so be careful not to drop or lose them. Battery life so far has been great. Besides the sound, the noise cancellation is amazing. Definitely noise cancelling to cut off the stupid office chatter I'm subjected to on the daily. The other plus is the distance these will stay connected to my phone. I can walk all around my apartment and in other rooms without disconnecting from my phone. I can also walk around the office a fair distance without disconnecting from my phone. All in all, EarFun wireless earbuds are totally worth my money and I'm very happy with my purchase."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-12,Very good headphones when they work. Note: They extremely rarely do.,"I always look at the worst reviews of a product before I buy, so to make sure what the worst is I could expect of it. This one has so many more good reviews than bad, and there had been some time between its worst reviews and my own purchase, so I thought I might be good with it. I mean, maybe they fixed what so many people have been complaining about. Well, it doesn't look like that! Personally, I absolutely trust all the bad reviews on this item, which has exhausted my patience as well as its reliability. -Headphones will rarely both work. The left one stops, and you have to either turn them off and on again, or pop them in the case, or pray to the gods of sound and wait. -When I turn them off and put them in the case to charge them, they still work. As in, they turn on again and are picked up by the bluetooth, which means that I have to get them out of the case, turn them off again, and hope they will do exatly that. -I never have gotten a full charge as per the product description. At most, after a whole night of the headphones charging in their case -WHILE THE CASE IS PLUGGED IN- I can get about an hour or so of sound performance, before hearing ""battery low,"" and the headphones shutting down after 10 seconds or so. -When, invariably, the headphones will stop working, I put them in their case to charge them. Now, given all the previously mentioned problems they present, I charge them for more than the 10 minutes which supposedly ""can make 2-hour listening."" I don't know if they can, but they certainly haven't. After charging them for just over 20 minutes, they didn't have enough battery in them for one song."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-04,Left bud will not work.,Left ear bud will not pair and have sound. Tried resetting and tried charging fully as well as forgetting the pair and trying again. Will rerate once resolved.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-21,Great earbud option in the lower price range!,Great choice for wireless earbuds. They sound really good for their form factor and have a long lasting battery life. I had one other pair of wireless earbuds before this (happened to lose one of the earpieces) and I'd recommend these over those.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-21,Fall of the ears,They fall off the ears. Had to return. Not what I was expecting from this product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-21,Buy!!!!,These are awesome. Worth it!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-21,Sooo worth it!,"I read so many reviews on wireless earbuds and these are awesome! Great price point, great product! You will not be disappointed!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-21,Nice pair.,"Nice pair of headphones.. Definitely worth the price.. Easy to pair, easy to control.. The sound quality is very good and the battery life is more than enough to last a listening session. Once done, put on the case and the headphones will be charged and ready the next time you need them. wore these for 2 hours straight and had no complaints about connectivity or comfort."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-21,Top quality headphones,"I would say top quality wireless earbuds with easy Bluetooth connectivity. Great design for its lightweight comfortable on ears like you can forget something is there on your ears. Coming to the main feature any shopper would look for is its sound, it produces a good sound effect and good base music for music lovers. For this price, it is one of the best headphones one can shop. No connectivity issues experienced even placing mobile for quite some distance. Best with call audios as well that lets us stay away from mobile holding pain. Battery holding capacity is extremely great that I used without charging for hours together. I have not tried wireless charging yet but having this feature is also a great option for future."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-21,Wireless And Clear,"The fidelity on these are spectacular, and I also like the way it charges. Haven't dropped them in a pool or anything but have sweated a bunch while wearing them working out and so far they seem to be waterproof!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-22,"Great price, Great Quality!!!","I have to say I have never owned a pair of earbuds. I was very impressed by the sound quality. They were made of high quality materials and I love that they came with a variety of size rubbers to fit in a variety of ears. I love that they charge in the little box they come in. If you are looking for a nice set of earbuds that are reasonably priced, that work and look like they are high priced, these are the ones for you! Two thumbs up! LOVE THEM!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-22,Great ear buds,Great ear buds
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-22,Way better than expected.,"Normally, I do not have to use the large sized buds, but I did with these, and you have to fiddle with them a bit for fit before they provide good noise cancellation. But once they are in, I hear nothing but the music. Haven't taken them into the gym yet."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-22,Same quality as the $150+ headphones at an unbeatable price!,"Ok so I was skeptical in the beginning getting a set of individual in ear headphones due to terrible experiences with many other name brands, BUT after using these for just the first 10 minutes I could already tell this was going to be a great set, my headset I just retired was an expensive set of AKG bluetooth headphones and I wont be using those again after getting these EARFUN headphones, now let's get into the reasons I like these so much, first off they are COMFORTABLE from the start and stay in my ear which is a common problem I have with in ear earbuds, the sound quality when I first turned them on was just hard to believe and after listening to some well known songs and watching some video clips it blew me away which brings me to my next concern, can people hear me clearly on a phone call which is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to bluetooth headphones, so I called my friend i talk to regularly to get his honest opinion on the other side since he will give me an honest technical opinion compared to what it normally sounds like, before i could even ask him why i was calling he said and i quote "" wow you sound crystal clear, are you testing out another bluetooth headset"" which right off the bat was a good sign, I turned on some noise in the background ran a few power tools and he was able to hear me with minimal interference. By this time I had been using these for a few hours and decided to try them out till the batteries and charger both were depleted from my normal use, well I've been using them for almost 5 days and just put them and the charger case on charge for the first time, if you are looking for top quality headphones at a great price without the $100+ cost these are what you want, I'm literally going to give away my akg set which was well over 100 bucks, these earfun blow them out of the water, they are more comfortable than my Bose set at less than a quarter of the cost and similar sound quality! !"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-22,Good budget headphone,"Soooo...$50. Good head phones for $50. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a budget wireless earbud. I have issues with the fit. They fit too perfect. They rest on my cartilage and are uncomfortable for extended periods. I bought them for jogging and are excellent for that. I definitely could see how they would work swimming, as they do fit inside your ear like a perfect plug. Maybe it’s just my ears. Sound quality is ok. I’m no audiophile so sound is basically sound to me so my opinion isn’t qualified. For whatever reason Hulu’s commercials sound like AM radio though."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-23,charging pad feature can't be beat,Excellent sound reproduction. The charging via a charging pad feature can't be beat! So nice to not have to worry about another charging cable.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-23,Good Bluetooth earbuds for the gym,"I needed a new pair of gym earbuds and I'm pretty impressed with these. With the price of about a fifth of the new AirPods, these buds do the job just fine with decent sound quality and stay tight to my ears during workout. Pairing then through Bluetooth is pretty quick, you need to look for ""EarFun"" in the search list. With regards to battery life, I only have to charge the case once a week and were able to use the headphones normally throughout the days. A side note, but I appreciate the fact that thet upgrade to the USB-C charging cable from the old micro-USB."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-23,Expensive Quality Product and Best sound for cheap price..,"The first pair of earbud that i bought and I am surprised. These are awesome. It sounded like the same expensive big brand headphones that I had earlier. It connects to my android phone (bluetooth 4 and 4.1) and laptop (HCI 6.12545/LMP 6.1) easily. I used it for watching movies, listening songs, calls and the sound quality is superb, perfect amount of bass and treble for best experience. It perfectly fits into my ears and have different size of silicon ear pieces to fit small and big ears. The magnetic charging inside the case works well and battery life is by far best for both charging case and earbuds itself."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-23,Excellent overall earbuds,"These are a great pair of earbuds. A built-in microphone, skip and rewind tracks, etc. I love the C-style charging cable, it charges the case faster and won’t wear out nearly as quick as other styles do. The case is small and compact, it doesn’t hold a ton of power but it’s enough. They’re easy to remove from the case, lock into place magnetically for charging, and sit comfortably in the ear. Sound quality is excellent, even during phone calls, so I’m incredibly happy with this purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-24,For life Battery 🔋,"Came nicely packed and instructions were readble lol
They are a liddo bulky for my ear BUT not uncomfortable. Battery life is amazing! Picked them up & started using them right away. Used them like 8hrs a day and didnt charge the case until like 4days Later🤯
Recommend 10/10."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-25,"Premium quality, made affordable.",I was impressed at the quality of this product given its price. Just glad I held off on buying the more expensive ones. This gets the job done. My only (minor) complaint is that they are slippery.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-25,"Good sound quality, but the bluetooth doesn't work well","These headphones work, sound quality is nice and when they're in my ears I can't hear anything else. BUT, when watching videos there is a clear .2-.3 second delay..just enough to make them unusable for videos AND the bluetooth often cuts out on me and usually one of the ear pieces will often disconnect on me with no warning. The battery works fine, not near as long as they claim, but long enough to do most things with a charge in between."

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-25,Excellent price,Excellent ear buds for the price...
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-25,Great ear buds for work outs,I also own Apple Airpods and I bought this for an extra pair for work outs. They fit in my ears very well and don’t fall out. The sound is very good. I need to have a lot of bass in my music so I stay motivated in my work outs and these done disappoint. Highly recommend.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-26,Surprisingly Nice,"At first look, I thought these would be a bit big for my ears, but they're very light weight and comfortable to wear. Out of the box they were easy to pair with my phone- they already had a 90% charge on them. As soon as I took them out of the case they entered pairing mode, selected it from my phone and it was done. The audio quality is really nice for earbuds. The tone is rich, my music is clear, and the best part is there is no lag when watching videos. I have different pair that has a few frame lag and it's super annoying. But I really like these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-26,"Great buy, excellent sound quality","I'm kind of a Jr. audiophile and I've been buying different TWS earbuds to find my prince charming. These earbuds are easily in the top 10% of everything I've tried in terms of well rounded sound quality and fidelity. Trust me when I say that some other brands sound terrible and others have different levels of terrible. These EarFun earbuds are an excellent buy and I'm glad I took a chance on them. Comfort is a 10, I can easily keep these in my ears for a full work day. Case is a winner, uses USB-C like my phone and many other devices I have. Note that these earbuds don't have volume control and are dependent on what your phone outputs. For me that was fine."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-26,Great for 40$,Good for the price be careful not to drop them or the case feels a lil flimsy but it's still good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-26,Exceeded my expectations,Love these!! Great for the price point. The sound is fantastic! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-26,Sound Quality and Fit,"I think the sound quality is great. I liked that the headphones came with four different sizes of plugs. The smallest plug fits my ears perfectly. I feel like they are very secure, especially when I am running. I will say that my left bud went out and I thought it had broke. Turns out if you hold down the buds for like 8 seconds it will power on/off. Do that and try and re-connect it to the Bluetooth and it should work. Otherwise, a really great pair of earbuds!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-26,Crystal clear buds !!,"I like that everyone sounds loud and clear as if they’re sitting next to you talking!! 👍🏽 When I ask the other person, they always say that I sound really clear and there’s not any feedback. The battery lasts all day which is another plus 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-27,Not what I expected,"The music is quite clear, the earpiece fits great (I use the smallest one) I kind of expected better volume, but this does a good job mid range. Hardly know you have them on, they are so light . For a low cost set, I like them. You may too, if you don't expect high volume."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-27,Great affordable earbuds! Just not great to lift weights with,"I have only had the earfun free for a couple days now and so far they satisfy most requirements. They are a very reasonable price for all that you get. They have excellent audio quality and they fit nicely in the ears. I listen to electronic, metal, jazz, hip hop most often and the sound is great without requiring an app like other more expensive makes and models. As everyone says, try different tips to find out what is more suitable for a snug fit. They are lightweight and convenient. The case is small and very easily fits in a pant or shorts pocket. They charge quickly too! I personally don't mind the lack of volume control and the buttons on the buds arent difficult to operate. Some reviews said they cause a lot of pressure in the ear when the buttons are pushed but I just tipped my head to one side and pressed the button without any issues. If the buds require resetting then it is an easy process and earfun has a tutorial on YouTube on how to do such if you don't want to read the manual. I have two issues with them. The first is that they are round and not the easiest to remove from the charging case or to pull out of your ear. This could be an issue for people like me with fatter fingers and a lack of fingernails. My last issue which is a big deal for me is that the ear buds come loose when doing high intensity exercises. With that said, they sat well when jogging, stair climbing and walking. Maybe they can come up with an iteration that adds an extension to the shell or a wing to mitigate the issue. Maybe I just need a larger tip but then there isn't an XL tip included. Overall, quality for cost if you arent looking for an earbud for serious gym sessions"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-11-27,Good for the money and feature set,I bought these because my $250 Plantronics buds stopped working 1 hour after I set them up. These work amazingly well for cheap earbuds. Call quality is just ok to not very good for the called side. Fit is crappy. I've tried all the sizes and they all eventually slide out. Overall pretty much as I expected for cheap earbuds and I would recommend them even with the quality/fit caveats. I'm using them mainly for listening to audio books in bed.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-27,Great battery life,I bought quite a few different wireless headphones for gifting friends and family back home .. I found quite a few which works good but this one stands out in battery life .. decent quality and noise cancellation as well.. perfectly fits as well
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-27,Nice wireless ear buds!,"I unboxed these headphones and first noticed how small the charging case was. It’s smaller than other wireless headphones I have, so it’s nice and compact. They connected easily to my phone. I turned on some music to check tonal quality and was not disappointed! Nice rich, full tone with great noise cancelling. Being two separate wireless units, both work together well. I have not noticed ether one not working. The fit is okay out of the box for me, but there are plenty of sizing silicone covers that allow for a nice snug fit. They stay in well as I exercise. If I had one concern, though, the noise cancelling is so good that I would question whether or not these are safe to use to exercise on the road. Otherwise, these work great!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-28,++ Ergonomic portable wireless earphones :),So I just had it for 2 days. But so far loving it! for the $50 this little thing does exactly the same thing as an airpod. It also recharges wirelessly. Loving it so far :) Much attention to detail was given to the case. Recommend!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-28,Great sound and great mic,Great sound and small and compact design. I had the Samsung buds and next to this one the best difference is the microphone I was impressed when I tested this one's one of my favorites
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-28,Great,Sound like more expensive earphones for a lot less the price.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-11-29,"Randomly loses audio every few minutes... Otherwise, it is good.","It would be good if it wasn't uncomfortable and if it didn't randomly lose audio for 1 second or so every few minutes. Unfortunately, that happens more often than I can accept and I will return mine."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-29,Comfortable in the ear.,The design makes sure that it doesn't hurt in the ear and the battery life is good too. The design is very classy. I like the product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-30,Initial audio drop out. Now working well.,"Audio drops out once a second for about 45 seconds maybe 6-8 times per hour. Disconnect Bluetooth and reconnect and it is good again for a while, then starts dropping the sound again once a second for about 45 to 60 seconds. Confirmed Bluetooth from iPhone XR is ok by playing same audio source to a pair of over the ear B&W Bluetooth headphones without any drop outs. Physical design is great. Good fit and noise isolation. Battery life so far is great. Sound dropping out kills this product for me. -Updated-
Used the earbuds again today for about an hour and did not experience any drop outs with the audio. -Updated-
Have used these earbuds while working out for several weeks now and they are great. No issues with Bluetooth, pairing or sound quality. Battery life is great. Considering another pair for my spouse."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-30,BUYER BEWARE,These earbuds are HORRIBLE!!! They have a loud popping sound on them both. I hear EVERYTHING going on around me. And any and every size padding is an ill fit.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-30,Amazing!!!,"These earbuds are amazing. They paired to my devices flawlessly. The sound is incredible. I read a review on CNET that directed me to these earbuds for Black Thursday as ""best buys"" and the reviewer raved about them and I was also able to get a $15.00 discount with a link from the article. Amazing deal. Amazing earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-30,Buy em,"Great, cheap, no complaints at all. Tired of paying $200 on headphones that last a year or so. Call clarity is good, sound is good. Quality purchase"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-30,Pretty good for first time wireless buyer,Great audio.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-01,Really good,"I was worried about this style of headphone that I generally have trouble keeping them in my ear,, but they fit so good in my ear that I can wear them for long time. The case is small, the charging is convenient with the ""C"" port and the sound is very good. Till now this earbuds are working flawless (No signal drops, no battery issues, nice sound)."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-01,"A false start, but redemption in the end","I really wanted these to work. Tried them once and everything sounded great. Tried them a second time and I can only get sound out of the right earbud. For whatever reason, the left earbud won't connect. Followed the instructions for resetting several times and tested with other different BT devices (tablet, phone, pc, etc.) All the same: Only sound in the right earbud. I emailed the company about this issue. Waiting to hear what they say, but I'll probably be sending these back. Update. Company was awesome. I emailed them about the issue and sent me a new set at no cost. This set works well. For the price and company support, they are a good deal"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-01,Great earbuds for the price,"Love these earbuds and had to buy a second pair for my husband after he borrowed mine one day. They are comfortable, noise cancelling and are great for running -- they do not fall out."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-02,Great headphones,These headphones are very comfortable. The sound is great. The price is great. USB type charging cable. Comes with different size ear buds.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-03,Good,1 side worked
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-03,Decent sound quality and fit but AWFUL mic,"Not a bad option for a budget truly wireless headphone. Sound quality is decent for price range and it stays in your ear better than other similar options. However, if you plan to use these for phone calls, do not buy. The microphone is almost unusable - people will not be able to hear you."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-03,Would not work with Chromebook,"The ear phones were comfortable and sounded okay. My major criticism of the sound is that they were lacking in the bass. I would have kept them, but with my Chromebook (Asus Flip C302 CA DHM4), they cut in and out constantly. Not just once in a while but every few seconds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-03,As close to perfection as you'll find in this space/time continuum.,"Best sound (for me), I've heard from any earphone/bud. Full range bass to treble is detailed, warm and intimate! Great fit, but try all three ear pieces to get best suited for you. Dependable battery life is 5 hours for me; six seems unattainable. No noise cancellation, but great fit makes electronic cancellation unnecessary unless you prefer living in a sensory deprivation tank. I would choose these buds up against ANY others, and I've tried a bunch."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-03,"Small, compact and comforting","Pros :
Very easy to control ( Good Controls )
Well balanced sound
Small compact case
Good battery backup
Water resistant to a good extent
USB-C charging cables
Lightweight
Less time to charge
Noise cancellation is good
Cons :
Connection issues sometimes"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-04,Bad and low sound quality,The sound on the ear buds is very low. I can barley hear the right ear and I can tell the more I use them the quieter the left ear is getting. Would not recommend.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-04,Awesome earbuds with great battery life,Best pair of earbuds for the price! Built really well. Not cheaply made. Easy to pair to an iPhone. Good sound quality. Battery life is really what impressed me. The charging case is great option too
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-04,Good value for price,"Pros: Sound quality is quite good, the fit is secure, connection seems to be stable. Cons: Push button operation is quite uncomfortable because when you push a button the earpiece digs more into your ear"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-04,good price for wireless headphones,These are great wireless headphones. I have a lot of earrings and its hard for me to find headphones that will stay in my ears. These actually stay in my ears and have good sound quality and also block out most noise while you have them on.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-04,Another waste of not needed plastic.,"Bad earphones, terrible fit, cannot even get them out of the case since there is nothing to grab on too. Poor design. Tinny sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-04,Great sound at a great price,"Much better sound quality than expected! Lasts a long time on a single charge, great price. No complaints."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-05,Very good...recommended,Definitely a solid product. Fits very good in my ears which is usually a sore spot for me since my ears are small. There are 4 sizes to choose from. Sound quality is good. On phone calls some people complained about being able to hear me. At one point I had to switch to the phone to be heard. Bought it for a special Black Friday price after reading a CNET review. Definitely a great alternative to AirPods or other high cost Bluetooth ear phones.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-05,Good quality for affordable price,"I saw a very nice review for these on CNET, so wanted to try these out. I'm glad I did. For the price, these earphones offer some very nice features & sound quality. The sound on these is pretty good. It's not too bass-heavy like some of the cheap earphones try to be. It has a pretty good spectrum with nice highs & lows. The battery life so far seems on-par with the claims. No complaints there. The best part though- USB C & wireless charging. I have used various other wireless earphones, and I've not seen any other similarly priced product giving these features. Very satisfied with these and glad I bought these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-05,Outstanding quality at this price,"I am amazed at the quality of these ear buds for the price. My recommendation is to buy a couple of sets so you’ll have spares to share. The Fit-
At first glance they appeared bulky but once you insert them in your ear they fit quite comfortably. They do not extend out like Frankenstein bolts like some of the other in-ear buds I’ve used. So they look great. The fit is snug which is likely why they show someone swimming while wearing these ear buds. I have not tried them in the pool and probably wouldn’t. Just me though. My Gotcha moment-
At first I thought the sound quality was not great and a little airy. Like every other in ear bud that I’ve used I went with the medium rubber in-ear piece. I swapped the rubber tips for the larger rubber tip which makes a perfect (and comfortable) seal in my ear. The sound quality is now better than my Apple AirPods including midrange and base tones. Battery life-
I probably use these ear buds 3 hours a day at work. Between the battery and charging case, I only have to charge them on weekends. Outstanding battery life. The Look-
Slick. A solid pair of ear buds all around."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-05,Best value in earbuds! Sound great!,"These work great for listening and cancel noise very well. Their weakness is calling. Any background noise whatsoever gets picked up and amplified to the person you’re speaking to. From my end it’s fine, but my wife hears things I’m not even aware of. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t bother using them to call her. I speak to others and they don’t complain, but they could be just being polite. The battery lasts forever!!! You have to charge the earbuds regularly, but the case itself provides an incredible amount of energy. I’ve had them for two months and only charged the base once so far and I use them everyday! Great value, not the best out there, but for the cost, incredible quality. Love them for under $50!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-06,Very good value,"Pleased with the quality of sound (mostly a podcast listener) and the battery life. Not sure how they'll work out in an activity like running, but for walking about, they do well. Also, no complaints from phone callers on the other end of the line, so the microphone is solid."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-06,Great build quality and sound,Have only used a few times but they connect everytime and have a good sound and are solidly built
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-06,I recommend these,"This Earbuds has a good design, it fits to ear also the battery is awesome. The passive noise canceling is good, thw sound is not the loudest but the sound quality is very good."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-06,Great but Volume Way too Low,Unable to use at gym or on flight as volume too low.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-06,Awesome. does not disappoint. Great battery life.,"Wish it was a little flatter so it does not stick out so much. Otherwise it is a great set with great sound, comparable to expensive ones. I like my Beats, but was not disappointed when I put these in."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-07,great for the price,"Fit great, sound good."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-07,Only one ear bud would pair...,"The first time I tried these, they paired perfectly with my IPhone and sounded great. After that, only one ear bud would pair. I followed all the directions to reset/repair/re try, delete Bluetooth and try again, etc. etc. and nothing would make the other ear bud pair and play. Would have been great if both ear buds would pair, but they would not. If you want more than one ear bud to work, then I suggest that you do not purchase this product."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-07,Connectivity with iphone 8plus,"Struggled a bit to figure out how it works, but works good. Battery life is amazing!! !"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-07,Works well so far,"Bought these earbuds during this thanks giving for my spouse. Its been a week of use. Easily paired with iphone 6. Works well with calling apps. Left and Right earbuds can be used separately, when we both have to talk to family & friends, each one of us use one earbuds. Changed the ear tips to smallest one, this fits perfect to ears, instead of medium ear tips. The packing and looks are great. My daughter likes the cute wireless charger ""Chest box"" :)
Rated 1 star less, based on the 1 star review. Will test the longevity of these earbuds for about a month. 1 start review indicates, need to take delicate care without dropping it on floor."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-07,Great Sound Quality,I bought these to replace my Otium bluetooth earbuds which kept on cutting out after two years. These are way better than Otium. Sound quality is really good. I thought that these would fall out of my ears when I walk with them but they so far stay put. I haven't jogged yet so we'll see how they perform. Overall they are really good quality earbuds for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-12-08,It’s pretty good my friend,"Very nice, great Christmas gift."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-09,Good battery life and nice sound,"For the price I got more than I thought I could expect with these earphones. The battery life is long enough to last through pretty much any domestic flight and layover and the sound quality is as good as anything else Ive used, to this untrained ear. I havent used them in water so I cannot comment on that yet"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-09,"Decent for the price, but with some flaws","My initial experience with these is as follows: Phone call reception is very clear, and people on the other end say my voice sounds much better than with other BT headsets I have used. Music is a mixed bag. Midrange is crisp, bass is lacking (disappointing), and highs are just okay. Overall, just okay for music. The charging case is slick, and kudos for using usb-c. It's great how they turn themselves on and off as you take them out and put them in the case. Battery life seems to be good. Pairing was easy. Comfort is, well, meh. The hard plastic applies some pressure to the ear, so while they are fine for perhaps an hour, I would not want to wear them all day without a break. It's not a cushy fit. Price and call clarity earned these 4 stars, other wise i would have rated them 3 stars."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-09,Cheap wireless headphones,Pretty solid headphones for the price you pay. I'll have some issues here and there but overal I'm satisfied. The small issues are enough to keep me from giving five stars though.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-09,Well priced and good quality.. But mechanical buttons on your ears?,Earphones have mechanical buttons instead of touch. In order to perform any action you have to apply pressure to your eardrum to click down a button. This is the main concern I have with these earbuds.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-09,They stay in,I liked the product because it was easy to set up with my computer to listen to music. They stay in my ears and the music is very clear.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-09,Great headphones.,I loved these ear buds from the moment I got them. Sound is better than my AirPods.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-09,Quality headphones for a decent price,"I had some initial trouble pairing with blue tooth. I followed the trouble shoot instructions that were given, and they work just fine now. The sound is decent for your everyday average listener. Totally worth the sale price that I paid for these. they fit nicely in my ear and the battery life is excellent! I would recommend these Ear buds to others that aren’t looking to spend a lot of money on high end ear buds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-09,"Great combo of quality sound, great price and good battery life though the case is a bit bulky.","For this price, I didn’t expect such a good product. I’ve run through every variation of Bluetooth headset out there. I like some. Some sound better or worse. However, this is a great combination of quality sound, great connection and really decent battery life. The only thing I haven’t figured out is how to conveniently always have the charging case with me. It’s a bit bulky, as all are that recharge in the fly. Had I a purse then this’d be no problem."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,Great earphones,I absolutely love these earphones. Great battery life and easy to operate. Would definitely recommend these to a friend!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,"Powerful, great budget option","I have to say that I'm very impressed with these little earbuds. The sound quality of the drivers as well as the microphone is pretty nice. Bass is pretty good and much better than I expected while not being ""muddy"". Comfort is pretty good though it hurts my right ear after a while, I think it's just due to my ear shape. I wear these every day at work and my battery hasn't run out yet."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-10,Not happy with my je sound,I like loud music and the volume of the earphone is low it's ok but I wouldn't buy it again but I'm sure there are people who like low volume.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,Love them!,It works well! Probably the best you'll get out of budget earbuds like this.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,good prize,a good product
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,Fabulous buy,Works great! Sounds great! Definitely worth the money.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,Awesome earbuds,These earbuds are amazing for the price. You can spend $150 + if you really want to have your earbuds say apple....
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-11,"wow!!! really work, even in NYC","NYC is the nightmare for earbuds: tons of noise, wireless interference, even people bumping you. These $50 buds *rocked* - I walked around Manhattan all day on calls and listening to music and people said I sounded clear. I haven't even tried the waterproof feature yet (read: shower and hot tub!!) and I'm in love. I also tested the Airpods (5x more expensive and experienced bluetooth interference trying to pair with my android phone) and the Sony WF 1000XM3's (4x the price and kept experiencing dropouts, just like other reviewers). For music quality, I'm kinda crazy and my reference point is the Shure SE846's ($900) with a portable amp ($50) - so when I say these are perfectly good, trust me! The look is innocuous - I have darker skin/hair and several people didn't realize I was on the phone and started talking to me. If you're blonde, maybe get the white colored version. p.s. this is not paid or comp'd: I'm just in love and trying to give back. I bought a second pair and contemplating buying a bunch as gifts!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-12,Outstanding earbuds for the price!,"I bought these earbuds after reading a review on CNet.com about them, and I'm so glad I did. I was looking for a reasonably priced second pair of earbuds. I also own a pair of Jabra Elite 65t earbuds, and—at one-third the price—the EarFun earbuds are a better value. tl;dr: definitely recommended! The pros:
1. The EarFuns sound nearly as good as the Jabras (there's just a bit less bass with the EarFuns, but definitely not enough to justify the 3x price premium of the Jabras). 2. The EarFuns fit better in my ears than the Jabras (of course this will vary for each person). The CNet reviewer stressed getting a tight fit for good sound, but I don't have any problem with the fit. Sound isolation is just as good as the Jabras. 3. The EarFuns seem to stay connected (to the phone and to each other) better than the Jabras, and experience less interference. The Jabra's encounter static and dropoouts whenever I walk through automatic doors (say at the supermarket) and even in certain places around my house (maybe due to my wifi repeaters). This also happens at the gym if I'm in certain places. I haven't experienced this issue at all with the EarFuns—the connection to the phone and each other is rock solid, and the bluetooth range is excellent. 4. The EarFun's storage/charging case is MUCH better than the Jabra's. For one thing it's flat on the bottom (the Jabra's case is curved and cannot sit upright on a flat surface). The EarFun case also has magnets that hold the earbuds in the case while charging; the Jabra earbuds just sit loosely in their case. The EarFun case can also be charged wirelessly (as well as with the included USB-C charging cable); the Jabra case uses a micro USB charging cable. If you already have a wireless charging pad for your phone, this is a great bonus, since you don't have to worry about the charging connector wearing out over time. Cons:
1. The EarFuns can't control the sound volume. I realize this is a premium feature, but I miss it compared to the Jabras. 2. The EarFuns don't have the auto-pause feature that the Jabras do (removing one earbud from your ear pauses the music until you put it back in your ear). Again, a premium feature, and you *can* pause the music from either EarFun earbud by tapping the button. 3. The EarFuns seemed a bit picky about pairing with multiple devices, at least initially. I had to re-pair them a couple times, and once even had to reset their connection to each other (this is covered in the instructions). But I haven't had to do either of those recently, so maybe that was just me getting used to operating them. 4. The print in the user's manual is SUPER TINY and printed in gray, not black, ink. I'm in my 50s, and even with reading glasses I couldn't make out the text and infographics. I had to use my phone's camera as a magnifying glass to read the instructions. It's possible they're available online (I didn't try to find out), but I suspect even younger folks will have trouble reading the instructions. To be determined:
I use earbuds mostly for music listening, not making phone calls. I know the Jabras work reasonably well for that, but I haven't had the opportunity to use the EarFuns on a call, so I can't comment on how well they work for that. Conclusion:
If I hadn't gotten a great deal on my Jabras (I paid less than half the list price due to a couple of online deals I was able to take advantage of), I would be really pissed that I'd paid so much when I could have bought the EarFuns for 1/3 the price and gotten an overall better value. The EarFuns are going to stay in my gym bag, and I'll use the Jabras around the house. I'm, even considering buying another pair of EarFuns for listening in bed. As I write this in mid-December 2019, I've only had the EarFuns for a few days, so it's possible my rosy outlook will change if they turn out to be duds later. I will update this review in a few weeks after I've used them for a while. But as of right now, I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reasonably priced set of earbuds that have terrific sound. The pros definitely outweigh the cons, and for the price you can't beat them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-12,Great earbuds,My wife was looking for something she could work out in that wasn't as expensive as air pods. These have great sound. They sync with her iPhone easily also.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-12,"No more cords, but lost chords.","Good points:
Comfortable
Decent battery life
Acceptable noise cancellation
Lightweight
Fit well
Could use some work:
Shielding (microwaves make them cut out)
Sound quality is so-so with music
The case...
Bad points:
Weird, unpredictable echo at times
Horrible on phone calls. Unusable. All-in-all, I like these. They aren't the best for listening to music because of the intermittent sound quality, but I listen to audiobooks (a LOT of audiobooks) and they work great for that. I can't use them at all for phone calls, but I seldom talk to people, so that's ok. Putting them in the case should automatically turn them off and charge them. It does not. You've got to wiggle them a bit to make sure they're charging, and sometimes they finish charging and turn themselves on, in the case. That's annoying. Sometimes, for no reason, there's a strange reverb in the left earpiece. All told, these are a 3 star product, however, customer service is 5 stars, or more, so it averages out to 4."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-12,Sounds Great for the price,Noise cancelling feature works well. I was wearing them at my desk at work and two of my co-workers were talking to me and I couldn't hear them at all. Drowns out all background noise.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-13,"Sound pretty good, good base, decent battery life","These sound pretty good, impressive bass. Sound good when from low to loudest setting. As with all like these - the battery life could always be better but a bigger battery would meen a heavier earbud."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-13,Great earbuds,"I bought this earbud was thinking to give to a friend. It amazed me that the size it came would fit my ear. Good bass sound and mini carrying case. I found that this earbud last longer than I anticipated. Work with my phone or computer. Sometime you have to reset to make sure that the earbuds are both connected before connect to the phone. Overall, I was satisfied and enjoy using this earbuds."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-13,Very thin sound,"1. The pairing is easy. 2. The connection is very reliable, no dropouts for about 1 hour walking around the house with phone not in my pocket
3. The sound is clear, but very thin, bass is virtually nonexistent
4. Noise reduction (there is no active noise cancellation on these) is average. There is only one rubber set, maybe my ears are larger and require larger rubber set. 5. Didn’t check the battery life, I assume is okay."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-13,These are not good for swimming,These were advertised as ear buds that you could use while swimming. However once you put your head under water they lost connection. The sound was great as long as your head was above the water.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-13,Good value for the price 👍🏿,Great fit and comfortable I use them playing basketball and many other activities my reason for 4stars is because when speaking with them on the other person can the background noise more clear than my voice. But great value for the price 👍🏿👍🏿
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-13,"Good, but not always","The sound is quite good. But I hate the connection. You can listen to music, then have a call and after the call they may not play music, so you need to reconnect them. I've done it about 15 times for the past month! Nevertheless, they are still good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-13,.,"Worked well for about 2 months then left earbud would cut out as if there was a short in a cord (obviously no reason for that) and there shortly after they both stopped worked
UPDATE: The company saw my review and contacted me about sending me a new set. I got it within a week and works fabulously. Thank you !"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-13,Overall good but....,"PROS:
+ Physical button (not tactile which is too stressful and not easy to handle for such small devices)
+ Good Design and great fit in the ears, they do not budge and provide good passive sound isolation
+ Good sound quality, including for phone calls. I would say 6/10, but good for this price range. + Waterproof (I did not test that…)
+ Good Case design with good battery life + wireless charging option
CONS:
- The biggest downside: Max Sound Volume is way too low, especially in the streets. This would be one of the only reasons. to return them. I wish it could be fixed by software update…Anyone has found a fix? - Cannot use Left earbud independently, only the Right one, which does not allow to double the potential battery life with only one ear usage. - also... There is a small latency time which cause the video image not to be perfectly synced with the sound... This is too bad when you watch videos..."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-13,Love them,I bought these for my son but I am actually going to keep them for myself and give him my old ones. I love that I can use these to talk on the phone and to listen to music. They fit great in my ear and do not fall out while I am cleaning or working out. The volume is great and I can use only one of the earbuds and still hear great. Good buy!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Excellent value,Lots of ear bud tips to fit in ears. Like how case charges earbuds and displays charge level. Don’t like how it’s not possible to stop charging when in the case. Batteries last longer if not constantly at max charge.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-14,Sound much better than expected.,"They got well, sound better than average, and hold a great amount of battery life. Wireless charging and usbC are awesome, and they work well as a headset for calls as well."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Simple,"Fits very well, decent sound quality, and range is as expected."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Too easy.,Love the automatic connection as soon as you pull it out of the case. In this ever increasing world of I want one less click I’m sad to say how much I enjoy this feature. One less button to push in my life. It’s like a Tesla it’s always ready to go.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Awesome Earbuds!,"These are absolutely worth the money. I've tried a few in this same price range and none stack up to the quality, reliability and range that these do. I work in a pretty big warehouse and tend to travel 40+feet from my desk and these are the only bluetooth earbuds I've used that don't cut out when I get around that 40ft mark. They are comfortable in my ear and come with a few different sized earpieces. The buds and case hold a charge for what seems like forever. I've dropped them a few times on hard concrete and they've held up very well. I would definitely recommend, and I'm even buying a 2nd pair to give as a gift."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Good service,Earbuds are ok. Good customer service. Enjoy the sound.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-14,Great sound,"I would have given it a 5, but several times while at the gym my buds won't connect to my phone and I've never had that problem with any other blue tooth devices. It's easily resolved by putting them back in the case and trying again, however who wants to take the case inside the gym."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-14,"Well made, nice sound, great price","Great deal,very good sound. Minimal noise attenuation. Exceptionally well-designed, excellent quality. Experimenting yet with good fit; too ez to lose now"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-15,Serves my purpose,Use this product while working out and hands free phone conversations.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-15,"Horrible naming of earbuds ""slave"" and ""master""","I like the value and quality thus far. I have a major issue with the wording of the earbuds in the owner's manual!!! The right bud is called ""master"" and the left is called ""slave "" to inform you that the right bud is the lead bud. In 2019 the fact that this is the best language that was thought of is appalling..or even worse this was the message the makers want broadcasted to the masses. This is unacceptable and has me considering returning these and warning others to stay away from them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-15,size.fit to my ears,ok
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-15,I made a mistake!,Die after 2 months.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-15,BT signal easily disconnects,"I have noticed that I lose the signal to the earbuds when I am around other BT devices such as my car radio. The audio signal flips on and off trying to connect with the other device. This also occurred in a cafeteria when I was around others using BT devices. If I am away from other BT devices no problem. I have tried re-pairing and it still occurs. When it does work, I do like them. Although I use one at a time. I do not like that the L only works as a slave so if the R dies out I cannot use the L earbud alone. I primarily use them to listen to my audiobooks. I'll be returning them for a refund."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-15,To here when you wearing it,Not good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-15,Very good,Five hearts!! Very good appearance and feeling. It gives a sense of value. Make it look high-end. This is the type of product I expect when commuting every day. It will not fall out of your ears. I will not use the loose hanging earphone during commuting. It is highly recommended! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Earphones with wireless charging!!!,"These are one of the best sounding earbuds at this price point. I ordered these because they have wireless charging. All you have to do is keep the case on the charging pad. Pairing is very easy and they connect to your phone as soon as you take them out of the case. Different eartips are provided. I use Samsung s10 and these uses USB C type for charging. So I don't have to carry different charging cables. Also, I can use reverse charging on my phone to charge these. I'm very satisfied with these.."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Well worth the $$. Washer proof,"Updated: I just found out I accidentally left these in my cargo pocket and ran them through the washer and dryer cycle. Amazingly enough, they both still work. If a product holds up that well then you know it’s worth it. I don’t even remember how long I’ve used these so far but it’s been awhile and I’m still on the original charge. Battery life is shockingly great."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-16,Good price,Would like to be able to increase the volume. Good deal for the price. on Cyber Monday
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-16,Connectivity is not good,Connectivity is not good. am using Pixel 3a and am having issues to connect to Earbuds. not every time it connects automatically. I never seen Left ear piece alone connecting to my phone ever. that means I've to always use right piece first. and connectivity is not quick. but you get for what you pay. I got it in a deal. Taking out buds from case is not easy at all. ** When reading reviews always read people who rated 1* and 2 *.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-16,"Good quality, not so great for the gym","These headphones have great sound quality for the price. They are also comfortable in my ears, however, when using them at the gym they tend to fall out due to sweat. I guess I will have to get used to having separate headphones"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-16,Pretty decent for the money,Battery life is great. Sound is good for the money but there can be a lot of noise when you run.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,"For the price, its a steal!","Likes: wireless charging, almost 50 ft. Range, great sound, really waterproof, great call quality!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-16,"Good Customer Service, Works Good if yours isn't defective","I originally wrote a poor review of these earbuds because there were severe connectivity issues which made these barely usable. I was contacted by Earfun, unprompted, who sent me a free additional pair which have not had the connectivity issues I was experiencing with my other pair, which appear to have just been a defective pair. The new ones aren't perfect, but they're definitely usable. There is only the occasional unstable connection which occurs pretty infrequently. I've been able to get pretty far away from my phone and still have connectivity. The pairing works very well and quickly, the sound quality is decent, and the noise isolation is okay. For the price these are a pretty good deal, if, you leave a 1 star review on your defective pair and get sent ones that work for free."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Durability,It does not fall out of my ears while I am working out.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Worth the price,Definitely get what you pay for but for the price I'm more than happy with them for what I needed them for.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-16,Great product for the cost.,I use while working out and just for music. Have never used it for calls. My first set didn’t pair so the company shipped me out another the next day. Works as expected.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-16,Afraid to lose them,Only drawback is that these things are slippery sometimes. Wish there was something holding them together like a band or string. I know I'm going to lose one or both at some point.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Very good headphones,Great headphones. Highly recommend them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Worth it,"I really liked this item. The fact that is is type c AND wireless charging, makes with worthwhile. I like that it has very good base. Would recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-17,Worth every penny,I had been searching for a set of earphones and the reviews sold me and I dont regret buy this. I would definitely buy them again or even as a gift too. Noise cancelling is awesome! Theu are so easy to carry and to even charge
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-17,"After writing review, I have been emailed numerous times by the seller to delete comments.","These are very bulky and look like a hearing aid. Not very comfortable either. The main problem is the connectivity. They lose connectivity even if they are 3 feet away. I missed the return date, so now they just sit in drawer. With all the positive reviews I believe most of them are bogus. Very disappointing and I have owned numerous earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-17,Great headphone,"Headphone has a long battery life
Easy to set up
Great headphone
The quality of the sound is amazing
It can be great for home,office or the gym
I would recommend giving this a try for yourself"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-17,Awesome!,It's been the best I've had
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-17,Great battery life,"These have great battery life. The charge in the case lasts a long time. Theses are a bit bulky compared to my last set. The would not stay in my ears with the provided tips....any time I'd move my head they would fall out. Could have to do with my ears, though with my previous less bulky ear buds I had no issues. So I made my own tips out of some ear plugs and tubing. Now they stay in my ears and provide great noise cancelation. Without my custom tips these were only good when I was sitting still."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-17,Good for the money,"These sound good but aren't loud enough. There is no volume control for the earphones, only uses what's on the phone. Good for the money though."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-17,I love these headphones,"Great sound quality, deep bass, great noice cancellation."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-17,Great for fishing,Battery life
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-18,EarFun Free Bluetooth 5.0,"I'll start with the main thing - this is sound, for wireless headphones they sound very decent. A balanced sound throughout the range and all frequencies is enough to enjoy the sound, there is no tightness and distortions in the frequencies. Good autonomy, turned out to be a successful model and good ergonomics."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-18,Spend more money. Buy better buds.,"Not great. Poor, inconsistent sound quality. Anytime your ear canal changes shape or any pressure is placed on the device, the sound changes. So plan on sitting completely still. Way too hard to get uniform sound in both buds. Oh and plan to be somewhere completely silent. Because the maximum volume isn’t even that loud. Save your money and buy better buds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-18,These sound great!!,"I really enjoy these earbuds. They sound really good and I like the USB-C and wireless charging options. The noise cancellation is good. Only an occasional loss of the left earbud from BT, but it comes back very quickly. Great value."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-18,Excellent value,"Generally a great product.. only complaint is that even at full volume on phone, if you are in a noisy environment, the volume out of the headphones is not sufficient.. but in quiet environments the sound is fine and the microphone works very well"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-18,not quite,the sound of calls was actually pretty good. but all callers said that my voice was extremely muffled or had that under water sound in all calls.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-19,Phone calls are hard for people to hear you talk,Love this product. The only problem is that people have trouble hearing me talk on the phone calls with them. Everything else is great!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-19,works well,recommended. still unclear on the whole noise cancelling deal though. has it? doesn't have?
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-19,Glitchy in getting connected to sources and each other,"Disliked lack of reliability in connecting, but appreciated the efforts above and beyond from customer service to make them work. They seem to work very well for listening to iOS/MacOS devices. Not so great for phone calls. Wouldn't pair with my stereo receiver hooked to the TV at all."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-19,Great sound quality,"These are my first truly wireless earbuds and I have to admit that the wireless technology had gotten so much better. Battery wise, one charge at night and I can use it for 6-7 hours. I also put them in the case that make it last even longer! The connection have little to no delay and I can just leave the phone in my room and cook in the kitchen. Earfun Free is not the most high-end ear buds out there but I think it changed my perspective on wireless earbuds now. Compared to some 40-60$ headset and earbuds out there, I think the sound quality is very competitive. There are not much negative to owning a pair of truly wireless earbuds like EarFun, but if I have to say a negative thing about this, it would be that these does not have good noise cancellation as a pair of headset. While it is quite good still if I am in my house with a little noise, I would still prefer a good pair of over-the-ear headset when I go out in a public space like a bus or train or a busy school campus."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-19,We’re great until.....,"These headphones sound great for their price point and are extremely comfortable. Battery life has not been an issue. Unfortunately after two months the right ear button no longer calls up Siri, but it does pause/play audio. I tried resetting the buds and checking the Siri settings on my device. I’m hoping EarFun customer support will be as good as Anker’s."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-19,Extra portable Bluetooth ear buds with fantastic sound and wireless charging.,"I found these ear buds to have excellent cd quality like audio with Bluetooth 5.0 and aptX integrated which made listening to music and movies fantastic. Although I'm not a professional audiophile, they went extremely loud, one notch from the highest volume slider on my new Android 10 phone. The nose cancellation was excellent when I took it on a plane to a recent trip to Texas that I came back from. To me and my subjective hearing, turbulence and cabin noise in the plane was kept to a minimum and I couldn't hear even a pin drop from the outside. Comfortability was excellent as the rubber cushioning wrapped deep into me ears and I could adjusted the in-ear tip size with the included rubber covers to comfortably fit easily into my ears. The best thing that I've enjoyed about having these were the extra portable size of the case battery. The included case which can recharge the buds at test 5 times is extremely light and portable to throw in my check-in luggage. Plus it has the ability to wireless charge which to me, is the most valuable asset."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-19,Volume is not much loud..,Although great battery life
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-19,Defective item,"Great Customer Service Experience, receive a defective earbud and after support quickly and effectively replaced with working earbuds"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-19,Good quality earbuds for low price,"The sound quality, especially the bass response, is good enough for my purposes and is much better than other earbuds I have tried."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-20,Not much bass,"I have found the tips that came with the earbuds did not give me a good seal, making the bass almost nonexistent. I have not been able to find replacement tips which properly fit the earbuds. I do like being able to wirelessly charge the case, but because of the poor seal and lack of bass, I have not been able to use the earbuds. Update:
I response to my original review, the company reached out to me via email, to see what they could do to improve me situation. Knowing I would not be happy with another pair of Earfun Free earphones, they offered me a pair of Earfun Wave over ear headphones. I have been using them for a week now, and am very pleased with the feel and functionality. The bass is great, the midrange and highs are clear, and I am very pleased with the way the company worked with me until I was satisfied."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-20,awesome,Just what I needed
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-20,Great earbuds,"For the price, these earbuds are unbeatable. Sound quality is good. Case is awesome. Battery life is crazy long."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-20,Amazing true wireless Earbuds,"This is what a I was looking for: good sound quality earbuds with type C connection and wireless charging capacity. I was a little worried about how these Earbuds would fit on my ears, but the truth is that they fit nice and got used to it. What I don't like about these is the microphone could be better, sometimes people can't hear me clearly."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-20,"Flimsy case, decent sound, great on a budget",Battery case is a bit flimsy and the ear pieces may randomly connect to your phone when the case is in your pocket. Otherwise pretty good for budget ear buds.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-20,Disappointed,"Only one ear bud worked. They are hard to get out of the charging box, seem to sit deep inside can’t get them out easily."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-21,"Great Sound, tunes out the world...","Nose cancelling is too good, I can’t wear them on my bike rides. So I gave them to my wife, she loves them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-21,Best Item Under $50,"I am purchasing this item as a gift for my uncle. This item was named the Best Under $50 by CNET, a reputable tech blog, and honestly, that was my reason for purchasing this item."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-21,Good sound but hard to make them fit to the ears,They are hard to fit to the ears even trying with 2 types eartips however the sound is perfect
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-21,ear buds,"arrived safely, exactly as listed"
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-12-21,Great sound and compact case,I like how the Earbuds were easily able to be paired. They come with a nice compact charging case and ear tips to suit your ear. The sounds quality is great! I'll definitely recommend these to friends and family.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-21,Clear timbre,"Special compact convenient to carry, no matter go out to travel, or shopping, and sound quality is clear, appearance is also very fashionable, cost-effective"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-22,Awesome!,Sound great! Easy to use! Would buy again!
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-22,No funcionan correctamente,No tienen el alcance que mensionan en las especificaciones
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,"Great sound, quick bluetooth connection","I have tried a multiple truly wireless earbuds, for I have had bad luck with sound quality. I am a huge fan of Earfun's sound quality. I also like how well the bluetooth 5.0 connected to my phone."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Good built and nice sound quality,"I love these little small wireless earbuds touch contrrol. Once the wireless earbuds are successfully connected to each other and your smart phone, they are immediately connected when removed from their portable charging case. I was initially having some difficulty with linking/pairing. However, once the initial pairing occurs, this is no longer a problem. You just open them and take them out of the case and they're all there. Since wireless earbuds remain connected to each other and remember paired devices, it becomes very simple and convenient. The audio is loud and the quality is very clear. I like the earbuds to be very small and light, and comfortable to wear. In addition, they provide very good noise cancellation. it is very worth buying"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Long battery life,"I was looking for the quality Bluetooth earbud. After using other brands, finally came across this one. Never thought that it will come out so perfectly. Great quality and product. Long battery life."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-12-22,Great,Bought for my fiance he loves them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Very Nice Sound Quality!,"Great set of earbuds, super easy to pair with iPhone, excellent full sound! They fit great in my ears and haven’t fallen out. I wear them during workouts and appreciate the fact that I don’t have to constantly adjust them to keep them from falling out."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-22,Just OK,These earbuds are just ok. I’m they block out sound (passively) pretty well but the sound quality is not the greatest. They also have connection issues all the time. Sometimes they won’t pair with each other or will randomly disconnect from your device. I would not buy these again.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Great product,"Sounds great, battery life leaves a lot to desire but great quality for the price"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-22,Battery life,Battery is pretty good. I like the design. Fit nicely and sits well.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,My husband loves these,They work well with iPhone. They sound great. Great value
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Can charge with USB-C and waterproof!,"My first fully waterproof earbuds. Amazing!! The sound quality is very good. I like the fit if these better than other ones I’ve used. Connecting to Bluetooth was easy and the audio stays in sync thanks to the Bluetooth 5.0. Battery life is not an issue and it recharged fast. Finally, there is earbuds that use USB-C! Much easier and faster than the USB-A. Very happy with these buds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-22,A blast with my new buds,"The earfun Buds provides an amazing sound experience. I like how I can use it on my tablet, laptop, spin bike and smartphone. Perfect for listening to music and podcasts as well as watching movies and TV shows on my devices. These buds come in handy for walking as well. I like the fit of the buds in the ear, they seem to stay in place. The battery life is great. I especially like the carrying case and charger all in one. This is great for when on the go."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Recommend,I am 100 % satisfied to the fullest with this product. Meet my expectations. Battery life is unbelievable & sound quality is at its peak !
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-23,Decent For the Price,"Positive: sound is good; noise canceling is decent, feel good n solid, stay in ear pretty well, battery life
Neutral: case is nothing great as expected
Negative: left ear can only be used if right ear is also used (cannot alternate to save battery); takes a while to charge; they disconnect themselves for no reason with phone in range"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-23,Good battery life but only support aac codec.,The earbuds work very well with the true wireless. Battery life is awesome. The sound quality is all right but does not support aptX or ldac codec. It does support the aac codec.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-23,Little Bulky but great earbuds over all,"Sound quality is REALLY GOOD!! And for this price also, can’t go wrong."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-24,Great wireless earbuds!,"Very good wireless. Buds for the price! Sound is good but not like Bose of course. Battery life is good and love the versatily of them, not afraid of sweat or dropping them in the pool. Wish it had volume buttons on the buds themselves."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-24,Left Earbud Doesn't Work,"My earbuds were defective out of the box but the seller was nice enough to issue me a refund without requiring me to return them. After following manufacturer's instructions for resetting and reconnecting, the left earbud still won't connect and I can only get sound on the right. I did change my rating from 1 to 2 stars due to the seller's good service but still can't recommend this product to other buyers."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-24,how to use only the left earfun.,i like all thing but i don’t like the size.also i can’t use one earfun.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-24,Just what I needed!,Great item. Reccomend to anyone
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-25,No Auto Pairing 😒,"Everything about the product is great. I have one minor problem, and one huge problem, though. The minor problem, everything about the product feels cheap. I'm only spending $50, but even super cheap Skull Candies feel superior to this. The huge problem, I have to manually put the headphones into pairing mode every time I use them. This disrupts the experience having to do this every time. Other bluetooth headphones and ear buds do this automatically. My Plantronics and Skull Candies connect as soon as they're turned on. Not having auto-pairing has me on the fence about returning the product."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-25,Great,Overall great product!!! Recommended
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Love These!,"Recently I tried a pair of Bose wireless headphones and decided I wanted to upgrade. I researched until I was completely confused but decided to give these Ear Fun ones a try. So I gave them to my husband as a birthday gift. I have used them non stop since. Oops. I will be buying my own pair ASAP. The sound is excellent with rich bass. Also, THEY FIT PERFECTLY IN MY EARS. I always seem to have an issue with that. These are secure, they have not slipped or fallen like all my other headphones seem to do. They are are comfortable too. I’ve made a call and that also worked well. I’ve also tried just one in the right ear for that. I don’t think you’ll find better for the money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Buy Them,Great sound and fit perfectly. I highly recommend them.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Very cheap,They could fit my ears a little better
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-26,Great gift.,"Gave this to my brother as his Christmas gift. After opening it, he had an easy time to setup and connect to his phone. Sound quality is amazing and fits his ear perfectly. He's been using it all day."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,these are amazing,The sound from these earbuds is amazing. I am not an audiophile but I love the sound better than that of my car or previous earbuds/headphones I have used. I have not had any problems with these and the battery lasts a long time. The medium size earbud tips were too big for my ears and my ears felt stuffy with them in. The smaller ones are better but since these go fairly deep into your ears they are at risk for getting a little waxy so maybe put something for cleaning them into the case. Overall- an excellent purchase for the price!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Great little earbuds!,Only had them a few days but I already love them. All the reviews are right on point! The sound quality is perfect! Ease of setup and use is exactly what I was looking for!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Earbuds,My girlfriend got them for Christmas and she loves them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Affordable and functional,"Immediately what I first noticed when I out them on was the sound, particularly the bass and clarity. Comparable to my Jabra Elite 65t that I paid twice the price for though fairly the Jabra has more features like outside noise enhancement which can be helpful when outside. Connection and battery life is pretty good. I haven't experienced any drops or unreasonable statics so far. I like how when you take one earpiece out the music continues to play and that each earpiece are identical and independent. Meaning that if some reason you lose one or have a preference to just have one Earbud in either ear, you can still listen to music or operate without being dependent on the other earbud. The fit is fairly secure though there's opportunity to adjust with the provided materials that comes in the box. Item is affordable and quality."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,A Bargain for the price,"Comfortable, easy to use, and perfect for working out"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-26,Pretty good,"Great for the price. Seems like the battery lasts a long time, I don't use enough to have drained the battery yet but so far so good. The only complaint is that I wish they were a little louder."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Why did I wait so long,Took then on there plane to drown out noises _ perfect. Took them to beach to listen to while laying in the sun - perfect. Sound quality great! !
EarFun,Free,4,0,2019-12-26,Worth it,"I'm honestly bit of a sound quality snob. For the price, these kick butt and I am extremely happy with the purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Excellent earbuds for the price!,"The Earfun wireless earbuds are amazing! They paired with my device very easy. I am able to power on and off with ease. They fit my ears perfectly. I am able to do my morning workout with no problems of them falling out or losing connections. The battery life is excellent, lasts 7+ hours. The earbuds are sweat and waterproof, needed when doing my intense workouts. Pros of the Earfun ear buds:
Hands free conversation
Voice assistance
LED indicator - enter power-saving mode when not in use. Battery life - battery lasted my entire shift at work! Charge in case - fast charging took less than one hour
Wireless charging - fast, less than 2 hours
Earbud weight - very light weight, do not cause ear pain like other brands I have used. Overall, the earbuds are a great product and quality for the price."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-27,True value for money,"These are great, solid ear phone (funs?). I have now bought 3 pairs in 2 months, starting with my 18-yr old son who loves his. My daughter and I tried his out and each of us got a pair. I have managed to snag them all on sale for $35-36 but even at the full price they are good"

EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-27,45 dollars is a deal for wireless earbud,USB port C and wireless charging
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-27,Probably the best Earbuds in this range !!,These are probably the best earbuds I have used so far in this price range. I am using this with an iPhone 11 And the sound is awesome !! Very comfortable to wear and very classy looking. No cheap plastic. The case also looks nice and well built. Very effective auto sync when you put them out of case. They connect almost immediately without any hassle. Thumping sound is great as well. I would not have expected better in this price. Happy purchase.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-27,Good for the price if you can get a good deal for them,"I initially bought these off a recommendation from CNET. In terms of features, these are great. I like the ability to use wireless charging. Being waterproof is a plus since I usually wear these while cleaning my house. The charging case is small enough to fit in a pocket (without making it look like you're kinda happy to see someone...), though it will take up a bit more space than some may be comfortable with. Sound quality... It's fine. For the cost, you're not going to get anything near the higher-end headphones out there, but you'll get clear audio with a good seal from the included ear pieces... You'll also shut out most of the noise from the outside world... That posed a problem for me because I work in an environment where I need some noise from outside to come in. I have to pull out at least one earpiece to here someone or make sure heavy equipment or cars are on the move... This heightened my anxiety for possibly having butterfingers and dropping one of the pieces...
Another big issue is the charging case... It works fine, but, if I had it in my pocket with the headphones, one or both of the earpieces might slip from the charging pins, causing it to cut on and connect with my phone. This became a pain when I already had another Bluetooth audio device connected to my phone, and the audio would cut off while I was listening to something because of them. I seen some manufactures alleviate this problem by designing the case lid to secure the earpieces in place. The lid for these are more of an open design that's not contoured to the shape of the earpieces (allowing them to move freely). Last gripe: I'm noticing that the left earpiece occasionally cuts out here and there, but not enough to be hyper annoying. In a pinch and for the right cost, I think these are good headphones. I first bought them for around $45 (with coupon). There was then a lightning deal for them around $33. I'm probably going to send these back if the Jabra Elite Active 65t I purchased pans out. Time will tell, but you can't go wrong with the Earfuns if there on discount."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-27,Left one didn’t work out of case,Left one does not work out of the case. Have reset it several times without any luck. I’m having a replacement sent so fingers crossed that the next pair works!
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-27,Worked great... for a week,"After losing my AirPods, I thought I’d opt for a cheaper pair of wireless earbuds to get me through my workouts. After getting used to how seamless AirPods are with Apple devices, using these was a bit of a chore. The sound quality was average, but I wasn’t particularly picky about that. Nevertheless, all of that was expected and I didn’t mind it at all — and I loved the fact that they were waterproof so I didn’t have to worry about sweat killing them. However, after a week they stopped charging in their case. The light indicators on the case and the earphones were not particularly helpful or accurate so it was a bit difficult to diagnose at first. After I realized what the problem was, I sent it back and just decided to opt for a more expensive, better quality pair. If they had worked without flaws, this would have been an amazing purchase. Unfortunately, they didn’t — and to ensure I didn’t have to go through the hassle of this again, I opted to buy myself something else."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-27,Connects to my phone right away!,Great item!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-27,Great earbuds just not very loud.,"Good sound. Good bass. Not asnloud as I would like, and that is disappointing. Love the fact that the case can charge on a charging pad as keeping track of the wire for the charger case would be a real headache. Connects really fast. Comfortable enough to be worn for hours."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-12-27,HOLY HEADPHONES!,"I must've gotten lucky for these to be the first true wireless earbuds that I've ever tried on/ bought. I am in love! Didn't really know what to expect from a 50 dollar set of wireless headphones... I am used to listening to music on semi-higher quality headphones; brands like Bose, JBL, Jaybird, etc. And these absolutely hold up with the pack! In fact, I like these better than the Bose headphones I was using before... AND they're fully wireless! I was shocked when I first put these in... the fit and comfort, even with the stock silicone tips, is incredible. I am still blown away every time. Another thing I was worried about with the fully wireless headphones was them falling out at the gym, or being to heavy and just working themselves out of my ears while running and such - I am happy to report no issues in the slightest. I had more issues with my wired headphones while running falling out than I do with these. The seal of the stock silicone tips is amazing too. No real need for upgraded tips in my case, although, I have some that I may try in the future. And may differ in other cases. I cannot accurately report on the battery life yet. The battery seems to be holding up well and the charging case that comes with them is super awesome! Love the 4 LED battery indicator lights that come on when you put the headphones back in their home. Overall I would 100% buy these again and recommend them to family and friends! Great work Earfun!"
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-12-27,great value,Got it from my friend. Sound quality is amazing and fits my ear perfectly. recommend it.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-27,Not for lap swimming. No sound.,The sound and fit are fine (not great but not bad either) but I bought them for lap swimming. There is no sound if you are at all submerged so they don’t work for swimming. The picture of the guy with his cap on and using the ear buds is misleading while swimming is misleading.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-27,Great,Absolutely love the quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-27,"Quality, water proof earbuds",Great pair of earbuds. I like to be able to wear them in the shower and during workouts.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-28,Long hours play time and sound clarity,"I like the charging time, sound and its play time hours duration."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-28,"Great headphones, but not perfect.","These are great headphones. The sound quality is better than a pair of Beats headphones that I have. The battery life is impressive. The range from phone is also impressive. Two things to note: When I take phone calls, my fiancée told me that it’s too loud on her end. Also, the charging case is fickle, and I have to fidget around with the earbuds to get them to properly charge."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-28,Awesome headphones!,Awesome headphone!!!!! I'm normally not very fond of earbud style but these fit perfectly and there is no falling out! Great job Earfun!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-28,Good choice,Ease of pairing
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-28,Amazing Quality once EQ is changed,"So to start out, I want to say that these are by far the best earbuds I've ever heard; and at this price point it's basically a no-brainer. I do want to say that when I first opened the box and paired the earbuds, it was super easy. Just make sure to pull both of them out at the same time so that they can pair to one another before pairing to the phone. Upon first listening to the earbuds, they will sound very flat. This may turn some people off, but this is a great feature that most people don't think hard on. Once you go into your EQ settings and set them to how you prefer (see screenshot for my personal optimal settings) these earbuds shine. The bass kicks hard enough to feel it in my entire body and the clarity is outstanding. I personally listen to every genre of music, but primarily Prog. Metal. These earbuds are amazing for metal all the way to reggae. For only $50 these earbuds are my #1 choice. Just make sure you set the EQ properly and you'll be good to go."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-28,Not airpods but just as good,"Great price, works good!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-28,Better than I thought it would be.,Fits well and the battery lasts several hours.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Wonderful,Thank you
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-29,Great sounding ear buds,Battery life is good and the physical buttons are soft to press in without hurting your ear. The issues i have are the low volume compared to all the other earbuds i've owned and tried out and the lack of volume control from the earbud's
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Surprised I loved them,"Although it doesn't feature noise cancellation, it does reduce noise quite well! I switched from iphone to Samsung, so I couldn't enjoy airpods pro as well as on iPhone. These actually can compare to airpods pro being they are way more affordable and excellent."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-29,Not enough volume level,These are great for the price but not loud enough
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-29,Not bad,Not bad

EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-29,Very good product,Would definitely buy them again! !
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-29,41/2 star wireless earphone's,"First the package arrived earlier than promised thanks Amazon! As for the buds they're pedestrian at best, sound depends on the device they're connected to some device's are louder than others. I do like the wireless charging option the 5.0 connectivity. They fit well and come with tips to adjust to your ear. So if you want thumping bass and loud volume these are not for you. Great product at this price point. So after upgrading to a Samsung S10E the sound from these have significantly increased as did the connectivity all I have to do is put the case next to my device and viola it's connected. Only thing missing on these is on board volume control. Great pair of budget wireless earphone's."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Great Buds for the Price,"I don't usually write a review but felt I must for this product. The ear buds paired with my Android phone instantly when I pulled them out of the box. They seat well in the ears and are comfortable to wear for longer periods.The sound quality is excellent especially when you consider the price. I listened to classical, rock, and folk to test them out and was well pleased with the frequency response. I would recommend this product to anyone."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Awesome!,These earbuds are wonderful and a great value!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,"Saw these on CNET, decided to take a chance","These headphones sound amazing, and I have gone through quite a few of them in my time. The wireless charging case in particular is a luxury I haven't seen in even more expensive top of the line headphones like the Sony WF-1000XM3s, which cost over 4 times the price of these. The battery life is pretty good too, I never felt like they ran out too quickly before I had time to get home and mindlessly toss them on my wireless charging pad. These headphones truly sound amazing, and in my opinion sound better than even Apple Airpods. (not to mention you have to buy a separate wireless charging case for those). Overall these are a great pair of wireless headphones that I would recommend to anybody looking to dip their metaphorical feet in the water for the plethora of wireless headphones in the market."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Small form,These earbuds are better than I had expected. Great to use them while exercising. Only negative is that they don't work well for talking on the phone. I will recommend them highly.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,EarFun,Best Buy in a while for me!!! !
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-29,Affordable luxury,These are very good quality and quite reasonably priced
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Great Earbuds for the Money,"I bought these after seeing a great review in PC Magazine. I've had them for a month and they are the best earbuds I've ever owned. Sound is way better than I expected. Noise cancellation is surprisingly effective. Pairing is easy and works every time. And maybe the best thing about them is the small carrying case that acts as a charger. You fully charge the case with the USB-C cable and it gives you 8-9 hours of total play. (I've gotten 3 charges of 2-1/2 hours each earbud use) . The carrying case is small...I can fit it in my pocket and not notice it.. When I'm done with music, I'll drop them into the carrying case with little effort. Last, the earbuds are pretty comfortable. I've had them in my ears for several hours without a problem. I've bought a number of mid-range and cheaper earphones over the years. JBL, Panasonic among others for $50-80. They ranged from poor to OK. I said I was going to go high end if these EarFun Free earbuds didn't work out. But I've been really happy with them. I can't imagine being that much happier with $150-200 earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,Good earbuds at a reasonable price,"Great sound. comfortable. Don't have enough feedback yet to know how they sound on the other end of a conversation... only problem I've had is once or twice (not much and not often) the earbuds fall out of my ear. Otherwise, everything is very very good. I would buy a set of these again."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,Love my earbuds,"I got these to listen to music when I am doing yard/house work and to NOT disturb my wife when I watch you tube videos. Exceeded my expectations so far. Very happy with purchase. 1. Very cheap (!$35 on sale) so I won't feel bad if I lose or damage them. 2. Very comfortable - I can listen for hours w/o discomfort
3. Great sound. I am not an audiophile, though. The max volume is at the limit of how loud I want to listen to it. Some may want to have a little more and dial back. 4. I don't think they are noise cancelling but do offer decent noise isolation with a good fit. 5. Had it for over a month and have not recharged. Still shows 75% charge life. I think it will meet rated battery life. 6. Nice compact design that stays put. 7. Connects only to one device at a time but reliably connects to that device when you pull it out of case. Have not tested microphone"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-30,Good audio but disappointing shape and size,"I only had the opportunity to use these earbuds for about 40 minutes. The sound quality was quite good (although the buttons to make them skip songs didn't work and only paused and played), but the shape and weight of the earbuds made them fall out of my ears often-- I had the correct size rubber earpiece for my ear. The first time I used them was on my commute to work. I turned my head at one point on the bus and the right earpiece fell out and I couldn't find it before my stop, so now, with just the left earbud, they are useless. Three stars because the sound quality is good, while the earbud structure is bad. Bummed I didn't get to use them more."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,Worth the money,Ear pieces work just fine and they do everything it says it does.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,"Long battery life, great sound, exceptional value.",The batteries last an extremely long time. I have not had to charge the case which is currently at around 50%...and it's been a few weeks since received! Amazing! Volume control would be nice but for the price and they're sweatproof...it's worth it. Light indicators work nice too.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,Great earbuds,"Great sound for music and calls, wonderful battery life and fits my ears comfortably and most importantly doesn't fall out while working out"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,Earbuds,These work great and battery life is good too. Love that it is wireless charging in the case. Wish they were a bit smaller.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,I think these are awesome!,I love that these fit nicely in my ears and have no problems with them staying in.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-30,Solid hardware and software. They are reliable.,"I lost my first pair, then tried another brand and was disappointed with the other brand. I repurchased the EarFun ones and am glad I did."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-31,Nice buds!,Great earbuds! Long lasting battery. comfortable to wear.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-31,Good fit with USB C charging,"They fit well and one of the few wireless earbuds with USB C charging. Sound quality is acceptable considering the price. If you're not an audiophile, I don't think you'll appreciate the difference in quality."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-31,Priced right,For the price you can’t beat these wireless noise isolation earbuds
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-31,Good product,Theses ear buds were a big hit with the kids I got 5 pairs. Though shipping information was incorrect. I received them all before Christmas. Very happy with the quality.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-12-31,Extremely POOR SOUND QUALITY!!! I returned them same day I received them.,Horrible sound quality! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-31,So surprised!!,"We got these for my 10 year old son. He wanted Raycons (they did a marketing blitz on youtube) but I felt uneasy ordering directly from them in case there were issues. So we found these on Amazon. Fearful of ""you get what you pay for"", I was skeptical that these would be any good. I bought with confidence that if I didn't like them for any reason Amazon would let me return them with no hassle. They arrived quickly and my son hated them! He felt they were too big and didn't like how they looked. He is a stubborn little boy, so there was no convincing him. I decided to give them a try. The construction felt solid and they went into the charging case nicely. They connected to my phone very easily. They fit well in my ears. What truly blew me away was the sound quality!! I have a collection of Grado and Sony headphones along with a pair of Shure SE315s. They aren't as neutral as those headphones and earbuds, but they have a very pleasant small boost in the bass yet maintain clear highs and mids. I was shocked. I listened to a variety of music on them for about 6 hours that day. No listening fatigue, no discomfort. I did the same the following day and had the same great listening experience. The completely wireless experience is liberating, especially when lying down or sitting in an over-sized chair reading. So I'll be keeping them. I still can't get over the quality for the money. A very nice product!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-31,No durability,They only lasted 2 months before they went out
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-31,Dissapointing Sound Quality,I have wired Skull Candy that has Crisper highs and nice deep base for only $10 yet they are wired . I now wish I had spent the extra $ and gone with the Blue Tooth Skull Candy for Just a little bit more . That SAID ! These to most ppl will do GREAT but I'm a Audiophile and expect top notch results . For the $$ I should have known better . lol
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-01,"Good quality, but they irritate the ears",Decent sound quality. Love the charging case... Keeps them charged for most of the week. I've tried many ear buds and these ones make my ears itch though... Don't know if the plastic is different or what but it sucks because I can't wear them for a full work out.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-01,Perfect fit,It fits perfectly. I use it at work and its very discreet.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-01,I LOVE these!,"I've tried other earbuds and they've been either too expensive or the sound quality was unacceptable. However, these earbuds are altogether awesome. Very decent bass, solid mids and highs, excellent clarity, good imaging, truly fun to listen to. Comfortable and easy to wear. Paired to my phone in about 2 seconds flat. They're simple but they do everything they're supposed to do and do it well. An outstanding value. Buy these and enjoy, and go treat your friend to dinner with the money you saved."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-01,Very Happy,"I found these to be completely worth the money. To me they are very comfortable, the sound is great and I am very happy with them."

EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-01,easy to use,"got these for my son and he has been happy. only problem is sometimes at the gym losing the signal, probably all the other signal traffic."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-01,Not at all meant for speaking,"These earbuds are AMAZING if only listening to music. When used for cellphone conversations, I cannot be heard or understood from the other end, and the other person is equally hard to make out at times. I've tried these on multiple calls with different phones/carriers/earbuds receiving calls. I'll be returning them to try a different brand."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-02,Great Sound - comfortable,"So far, they work great! Sound and battery life are excellent."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-01-02,Easy setup,Nice little earbuds and paired quickly. Very easy to use and the case makes keeping these things charged very easy.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-02,NO VOLUME CONTROL!!,"these fit nicely into the ear, the sound quality is good, and the battery life/charger is excellent. Why in the world make ear buds that do not control volume as well? It's either on or off, how stupid is that? Now I have to carry my phone around also in the volume of a song changes unexpectedly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-02,Great product!,Love these. Great sound and very comfortable at great price!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-02,"CNET was right, these earbuds are awesome!","There are a hundred and one choices when it comes to wireless earbuds at or under $50. I got the Earfun Free buds on cyber monday for $33, and can say they're worth the $50 they sell for the rest of the time. I saw a video where the tester said they had weak sound, but I think that may have been just the set he got because mine sound great and are plenty loud. The key to tailoring them for the best sound is to check the fit in your ears with the different ear gels. That's how you get the noise cancellation and superior fit. I use these earbuds all the time and if you want to hear the down side, it's minimal. The biggest thing would be the physical button on the side of the earbud as opposed to a touch panel. But they're fifty bucks! You have to spend more than double that to get something as nice as these with the touch panel sides. It's just past the start of January. I've had these for a month or so and that's all I can complain about. And it's not even a true issue for me. The Earfun Free earbuds are great. By the way, the wireless charging case is pretty good, too. I turned it upside down and shook it like crazy and it stayed closed. Then, I opened it and shook it some more. The magnets that hold the earbuds in are perfect. Even with it open, and me trying to shake them out, I couldn't. If you're on the fence about whether they are worth the money or not, they are a good deal. Like, they aren't a good deal just because they cost $50, they're a good deal, period. Frankly, I'm surprised they aren't charging more for them. You can see all the other great reviews for them. Take a chance and pick a set up. You won't be sorry. You'll probably end up writing a review, which you never bother to do, just because these headphones were such a pleasant surprise. Thanks for reading and enjoy your new earbuds."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-02,Horrible Sound,"I was so excited for these since I hate the sound of my earbud cord hitting my clothing or desk, whatever. BUT, with these I could hear by own breathing, moving, and heartbeat. I was so distracting and the sound quality was poor. I returned them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-02,Great budget earbuds,"For the price, these earbuds had great sound and fit in my ears well. Noise cancelling was good. Had good customer service from the seller too."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-02,Very good quality for the price,"Good sound (not as good as the IPods, but excellent quality for the price) with great noise cancellation."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-02,Impressive features with good sound,"Why spend more when these fit great, have excellent battery life and sound pretty good. The volume doesn’t go quite as high as neckband headsets I’ve owned but they maintain quality sound throughout their range."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-02,Great Sound but Low Volume,"Thia is my 3rd pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds. The sound quality is great however I find myself turning them up all the way when listening to music on my Samsung S8 phone. They do connect quickly however even this morning when watching videos on Amazon.com, the right earbud kept co0nnecting them disconnecting multiple times. I also find that the volume some of the content on YouTube is not loud enough to enjoy. It just seems odd that I would have o turn the volume up all the way just to listen to music. Maybe I got a bad pair. I just wish I could get more volume out of them"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-02,Non-USB charging cable.,"The earbuds themselves work well enough, but the charger has a tiny proprietary charging cable that you WILL lose, which will make the earbuds worthless."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-02,Don't buy,Sound is super low don't waste your money
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-02,Affordable quality product.,"These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever purchased. The battery life is amazing. The case is amazing, it's constantly charged. The fit is amazing. Now regarding the actual fit there was a trick that I did to make them fit perfectly. If anyone is use to work earplugs you know that the recommended way to apply them us to pull (the top of) your ear back and I sent the plugs in."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-03,Stylish and high performance earbuds.,These earbuds are great for listening to music and taking phone calls. They link up to my android quickly and have a decent range for bluetooth. These charge quickly in their holding case and are fine for wearing during exercise. Very comfortable and snug in the ear.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-03,Stays charged all day.,The sound quality is amazing. My daughter purchased a different brand for twice the money and the sound isn't even close.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-03,Ear fun will not connect to my phone,"I received the ear fun, charged it for hours, attempted to use them and nothing from the left ear. The right ear fun worked good sound no problem at first. I placed it back on the charge, tried the left ear again and now neither one will connect to my phone. I reset my phone attempted to connect again and still nothing, now I can’t connect to my car while the ear phone is with me."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-03,Great earbuds. Just wish both were independent.,I like in ear buds. They’re just better. I got these at 35 bucks probably the best headphones I’ve ever used. Qi charging a major plus for the cost. Imagine shaving your face while listening to an audio book without the wires getting in the way. Of course if your a dude.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,Better than other headphones that are 4x more expensive,Best headphones I’ve ever owned
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,What a surprise.,"These earbuds have been a real treat. They were easy to set up, and the sound quality is really good. The only difficulty I have with them is getting both to sync at the same time after only using 1. It's tricky, but not a deal breaker."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,Husband is delighted!,"I originally purchased these as a gift for my 18 year old daughter for Christmas. Unfortunately, they didn’t fit her ear properly so she wasn’t able to use them. My husband tried them, even though he doesn’t typically use headphones or earbuds. He started testing them by syncing them to his IPad and watching a movie. As he got accustomed to wearing them he started liking them more and more. Just this morning he told me he could not imagine not having them now. He now prefers to stream his shows through the IPad because of the incredible sounds with the earbuds, as opposed to watching TV. This has me pretty impressed as he is very fussy, and rarely feels strongly about any types of products, but when he does, he’s all in. Bonus for me? I don’t have to watch savage Viking killing sprees! Haven’t had them long enough to comment on battery life as he’s only using them an hour or so a day. He’s a chef and works long hours, but is enjoying his time after work and using the earbuds to wind down the day."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-04,Ok earbuds. Not quite loud enough,Battery life is good. Sound is good too but doesn't get near loud enough. Also cant use one bud at a time. There are other earbuds at this price point with more features and better sound. Also I got a 2nd pair and the sound is the exact same. Not bad earbuds but they arent great either.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,Great quality for price,I bought two pairs. One for myself and other for my friend. I can use them at the office and no one knows I have them in. The quality is great and I like the fit. Only downside is that the right is the master. So if you want to use the left the right has to be out of the charging case. I’m yet to figure out how to lower volume.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-04,Earfun Earbud,"The earbuds fit good, they also fit very good in the charger case. The charging contacts are great and really sits in place well and doesn't move around. However with all that said, I am disappointed on the sound volume. I can only use 1 earbud at a time due to work restrictions. Even with the volume turned up, I can barely hear the music, unless I'm in a quiet room. The other issue that I have is, only the right earbud is a Master. The left is only a Slave and can't be used without the right one being used, too. This is a problem since I can't listen to both. When my right one goes low on battery, i need the ability to use the left one by itself. I really wish I could give this a 5 Star or even a 4 star, but due to the those 2 issues, I just can't."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,"Reliable, great price, and great battery life",These hold up pretty equally with my previous $200 earbuds and they're a lot more reliable for much less money. They're great. You don't need more than this.
EarFun,Free,1,0,2020-01-04,2 pairs broke in 3 weeks (Not Sweat-Proof),"I really wanted to like these earbuds. I was given them as a gift and used them for just a few workouts. They claim to be waterproof but I took my first pair on a few lifting and running workouts and they did fine, great in fact! The problem started on the longer workouts. The first pair broke when the right earbud went mute during a long (only about 90 minute) indoor bike ride. I made sure they were fully charged. I suspect the sweat entered the earbud and permanently damaged something. I assumed this was a one-time issue and returned them for another pair. I took this new pair on another long indoor bike ride. Broken within 30 minutes! I once again can only hear out of my left earbud. Truly not waterproof as advertised. The manual shows someone swimming with them. While I have never brought them near water, I don’t know how they can advertise this and then they aren’t even sweat proof... it can’t be coincidence that two earbuds broke for the same reason within a month."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-04,Audio is delayed from Video,"When I connect the buds to my phone, the audio is delayed from the video scenes. This experience is terrible. But if I just listen to the audio alone, then it is ok quality both sound and noise cancellation. I would not recommend it to anyone."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,You get more than what you pay for.,"I really like this product. The sound is quite good, controls and fit are very easy to adust. For budget true pods, this fits the bill."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-05,great idea with wireless charging,"I am still on the fence on these.. I got these on a after Christmas sale and thought I'd try these..
seems this type are very popular and with wireless charging, I can put the base on my wireless charger..
I can put them on the Samsung wireless charger and it works.. one less charging cable! they do sound good, the distance from the phone or iPad is pretty good..
I don't know how waterproof they are.. I wont be taking them to the hot tub or pool..
But I do have trouble keeping the right one in my ear if I yawn or talk much...
one thing I did notice.."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-01-05,These are as good as AirPods,These are amazing. I don’t know why people get AirPods. These are 100$ cheeped.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Earbuds,Sounds are great
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Great Deal!,Great for the price. No problems!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Well made,Excellent sound quality
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-05,"Great sound, but didn't fit in ears...had to return","I got this as a gift for my husband, and they seemed to produce great sound and connect to his phone just fine. He also liked the case. He could not for the life of him figure out how to get them to stay in his ears though -- they just didn't fit. Even while doing a fairly stationary actively, like biking or sitting, they wouldn't stay. He's never had this problem before with earbuds, so we were both surprised. We ended up returning them when I found him using his old headphones instead of these since these just wouldn't stay."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Great deal,These buds are great. So glad I did not spend the money for others that are way more expensive.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Doesn’t fall out at all,"Got these today just in time for my run. Noise cancellation is awesome, Sound quality is fantastic and they didn’t fall out of my ears once! Awesome product and well worth the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Awesome Product!,"First and foremost, this product is amazing for only 50 dollars. I actually got mine for 47 bucks through a small discount. The presentation of the box is really nice, the case is not bulky at all. Very sleek. The earbuds themselves are designed well. They fit perfectly snugged without falling out. Setup and pairing was a breeze! The earbuds have great sound, extremely long battery life and sounds phenomenal when making calls. I will be getting a YouTube channel this year band I will be reviewing these because you can't beat the price of this great product. The bass is pretty good, I would like just a tad more bass but it's not a deal breaker. Overall, great product. I never would have expected this. For this quality, I would have paid ridiculous prices. Thanks Earfun for thinking of your consumers!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Left ear bud quit working about 10 hours of use,"Bought these in November, so as of today the 5th of January 2020, the warranty has expired. I have used these for no more than 10 hours, as I listen to Podcasts, occasonally. I talked to a support person at amazon and he was not able to help me get the left ear bud working and has referred my to the company. The company sent me an email saying they would send me a new set and I did not need to return the old. Keep posted. Company followed through with promise to replace free of charge. I now have paired both buds and am listening to podcasts"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,The best!,Best budget wireless earbuds!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-05,7/10,Sound quality is above average. Build quality is bad and whole unity looks flimsy. Handle with care. Looks wise it's good.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Great value for the money,Not as comfortable as some maybe I just got funny ears The sound quality is very very good I like the charging case and I’ve gotten about 4 1/2 hours on one charge and then you can just put it back in the case And an hour later get another 4 1/2 hours I’ve used it for conference calls and people say I sound great
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,My response,I like everything about this product there are no compliants hear
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-05,EXCELLENT PRODUCT! Worth its price!,Great product for the Price. It pairs quickly with my iPhone or Apple Watch. There is no real noise cancelling technology in this product other than like earplugs they close the ear canal. Passthrough tech would be awesome but I would not expect it at this price point. Battery life is awesome as well as the audio quality. My only issue is the fit. The silicone ear pieces it comes with are a little short so I switched them out because they kept slipping out while running. I changed them with a bit longer silicone ones I had and BAMMM. No more issue.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Don’t think twice. Order them,WAY better than expected
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Wish I'd had these on my last trip.,"Sound quality is very good and work great to cancel noise. Wish I'd had these on my last flight to California. Battery life is excellent so far. I use them intermittently, but I haven't had to recharge them yet. Like that I can use my wireless Qi pad to charge them, with my phone. Pairing was super easy. Instructions for answering phone was listed for wrong ear piece."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-05,You get what you pay for no complaints,Good product for the price connectivity can be hit or miss sound is decent battery life is around 4 hours
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-05,Not worth buying or receiving as a gift.,The volume capacity is seriously lacking and callers on the other end of your conversation hear too much background noise. I wouldn't recommend.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-06,Nice earbuds,Fit in ear nice great sound long battery life.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-06,Decent product,"Overall, this is a good product. Pros: good sound and noise cancellation, good fit, comfortable (for a few hours) good functionality of buttons, decent price. Cons: Getting the headphones to charge consistently in the charging box. It often times takes a minute or two of fidgeting to get them both to charge. Also the silicone ear piece provided is rather small, so I put different ear pieces on the headphone and it was then too big to fit in the charging box."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-06,My wife Loves Them!,I got these earbuds for my wife and she love them. Easy to pair and good sound. If she is happy I'm happy!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-06,Wireless Earbuds,"I feel we not buy wrong these earbuds, that music sound very good and connects very stable. And I buy one more to my son."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-06,Louder,Only thing is I wish is that they got louder.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Easy to pair and good sound quality!,"The earbuds were pre-charged when I got them. The case was also fully charged at delivery. Pairing the earbuds to my Pixel 2 was easy and quick. The manual has all the steps and information that one could possibly need. On playing music, sound quality was pretty good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Great earbuds!,"I’ve been using these for about a month. I’ve paired them with my phone, laptop and iPad with no issues. The process is simple and I feel like the charge lasts a long time and the charge indication light on the case is nice. I would happily purchase them again."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-07,Sounds and fitting,Quick connection. Fitting battery life sound quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Good quality,Like it
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,How great the Company Work With Me,"When I got the first pair the left ear plug did not work. I tried to trouble shoot them according to the instructions to no avail. I contacted the Company, and I was patient with working with them, too a successful end. They actually sent me a New Pair, and they worked exactly the way they said. I would Recommend these to anybody."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Extremely good for the price,Airpods at 150$ are nonsense. These babies at 37$? they're perfect.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-07,Quality product with a few quirks,"The ear buds do last the advertised six hours on a single charge. Although the sound quality is not the best, it is adequate. The biggest issue I have had is despite trying all the different ear bud attachments that came with them they keep popping off during use. For the price it is still worth the cost of purchase, give them a consideration if your looking for reliable good quality ear buds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Affordable Bluetooth buds,"Got these for my 9 yr old to use he’s active and tough on things. $200 ear pods were not an option. These have different size ear tips, the smallest fit his ears perfect. Easy pairing to his iPad sound great. He’s happy and I may get myself a set for the gym too."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-08,Value for money.,"I would give 3.5 stars. Let's talk about the problems:
1. A major problem is the left ear bud get disconnected from the master ear bud which is the right one and act as independent Bluetooth. Due to which yoy have reset the earphones. 2. Sometimes the voice is inaudible over voice calling and slow
3. Sound is good but not great
4. Battery is as promised."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Awesome value,"Nice product. They fit well, the battery is solid, and the sound quality is just fine. Can’t beat these for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Just what we were looking for,"Got this as a gift for my 18 yo son and he loves them. They work great, keep a charge for many hours and block out some of the outside noise. The fit is great too. We are very happy with this purchase. Would definitely recommend these wireless earbuds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-08,Convenient little buds,"These are great little earbuds, for the most part. They have trouble connecting if you use them on more than one device (a little frustrating, but i suppose it’s just a learning curve)
Overall, I’m satisfied."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-08,Seem pretty good. Haven't used a lot.,"The sound quality is very good. Comfort is OK. I wear headphone when I walk my dog. They are almost too quiet. And while they sound great when I am just sitting, when I am walking, the motion of walking creates a bit of a woosh, woosh, woosh with my steps. Not sure why that is but as a result I am not using them as much as I thought I would. Also, the over the head headphones go on and off quicker. Too bad. But still seem like a good value and I will probably use them for sailing in the summer (waterproof)."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-08,Outstanding for the price!,"The ear buds seem well made and stayed in my ears very well. I have not tried running with them yet but held up in the gym walking inclined, stairmaster sessions, and weight lifting. The audio quality is pretty good. I have heard better earbuds but considering the price, these are great! Paired easily the first time to my Galaxy s9+. The only minor problem I have with them is that even at Max volume with developer options volume limiting turned off, they still don't get very loud. This is probably better for my hearing long term but I prefer headphones that can really scream if I want them to, and these just won't."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Quality,My grandson loved his Christmas gift! Great buy!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Great Value!,Great for the gym. Long battery life.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Good value,"Good fit, good sound, good battery life. Not sure about noise cancelling capacity because I rarely use the buds in noisy environments. Bottom line: I like them and would buy them again."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Nice earphones!!!,Nice earphones... has good sound quality and i love the charging case. it is smaller than the other ones that i have. battery lasts long!!! over all good earphones! !
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-08,Horrible quality,Horrible. Don’t buy
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-08,Great product with one minor issue,"Good sound quality and comfortable. I got about 5 1/2 to 6 hours before I got a warning that I was @ 10% power remaining. The only issue I have, which is not a deal breaker in my opinion, is that the sides are smooth and when you try to remove them from the charger case (which seems to be magnetized) they tend to slip out of your fingers and back into the case. I believe contoured or rubberized sides, giving a better grip, could assist with this."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-08,No aguantan el sudor,Se traba mucho cuando se está en el gym
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-08,Good product lacks in sound,Great fitting and long battery life. Sound isnt very loud. Leaves you pushing the volume up button constantly to somehow make it go louder.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-09,Great Earbuds,Great wireless earbuds. The battery life is crazy good letting me use them multiple days with out charge.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-10,Great features with average sound and volume.,"The Earfun buds were so highly rated that I was expecting so much. On the build quality and many features for such an inexpensive price they get a 5 star rating. But for me ... sound is everything and these are only slightly above average, thus 3 stars ... having a balanced high quality sound with only average volume. Even at 100% they weren't loud enough. They have so many great features for the price ... type C charging that is wireless and are water proof. I bvb suppose that I could have received a defective pair bit I have read other reviews that said the same thing. In short ... they do not pack a punch and don't bring out the bass ... even when the music selection calls for it. I really wanted to like these since on paper based on features ... they should have been perfect. I've decided to send these back and keep the other set I bought ... Mpow m5/t5 ... same quality sound but packs a punch and get much louder but unfortunately lack some features of the Earfun but they definitely have the volume!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-10,Great headphones for a great price.,"These headphones have great bass and create a nice seal in you ear, blocking out lots of outside noise so you can clearly hear phone calls and music. They are comfortable and not heavy at all. The sound quality is great. I got two pairs of these - one for myself and one for my son - around Black Friday for $34.99, but they are clearly worth the full price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-10,Great price,Was a gift for my daughter
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-10,Fits great,My dad wanted some wireless earbuds because the wired ones always got pulled when he works out side. These are very nice materials and fit comfortably. They hold a charge and are actually loud. My dad loves them. He says they are easy to use for someone who is not great with electronics. Charging case is the perfect size

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-10,"Great bluetooth earphone that last long, clear sound","the battery life on this Bluetooth earphone is awesome, and easy to connect. i listen to music and on the phone for a while and the battery still last. the sound is super clear on the phone and with music, I prefer using the medium bud since it was the most comfortable one on my ear, the wireless charging is shows that this earbud is keep up with new tech. overall i recommend this earbud"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-10,Decent for what I want,I had a very difficult time connecting the other earbud once the initial ear bud was paired to the device.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-10,Does not pair withbiphone~very disappointed,Could not pair to iphone. Tried for HOURS. NO BUENO
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-10,Great True Wireless Earbuds,I was worried that because these earbuds weren't more expensive they wouldn't be as good of quality. I am happy to be wrong. The sound is excellent. The battery life is also comparable to any on on the market for more money. Would buy again.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-10,The sound stage is overall very neutral. They hit at all the right spots for my taste,The passive noise canceling is amazing on these. Once they are in your ears you block the whole world out. The deep base literally shakes your brain. I like these so well these are now my go to ear buds for music. Battery last a long time. Have have yet to have them go dead.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-10,Great for running and the gym,"Fit well, good battery life, easy to use. Better sounding than most wireless buds. They are a GOOD purchase

EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-11,Satisfied,"They do fall out occasionally. They do cancel out noise; tried them on my 9yr old and he couldn’t hear me at all lol. They don’t connect your voice calls, that was a bummer. Other than that pretty good set!"

It come in the really nice case that it looks better in person than in the picture. It looks like a good quality item. They are very comfortable once they are on.

EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-11,Great sound quality and extremely comfortable but not good for phone calls.,"I've tried very many truely wireless earbuds and for under $50 these are pretty good. For music the sound quality is pretty good and differs depending on what app you're using. The volume is a bit lower than I like when listening to music, but I have noticed that when you're using Youtube or making a phone call the volume is a lot louder for some reason. They are very comfortable and discrete. I have problems with finding earbuds that fit my ears or if they do then after a while I get ear fatigue and they start to hurt. With these earbuds they fit perfectly and after 4 hours of continuous use I did not have any ear fatigue. My only and most annoying con with these earbuds is the mic quality for phone calls. In a quiet room I have no problem using them for phone calls, but at the gym or outdoors everyone says they can't hear me. Very disappointing since they check off all my other requirements. All in all though they get a 3.5-4 star rating from me."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-11,You gotta have the right ear size in or they will fall out easy,They stay in your ears if you have the right ear size on them

EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-11,A good pair of headphones for the price!,"These headphones were packaged nicely and came with a warranty which was comforting. The set up was easy, and the charging home is nice. I have yet to use these at the gym, but they seem to stay in your ear well with a nice decent sound quality. I doubt these cancel any noise, but they work as an inexpensive pair of Bluetooth headphones for physical activities or anything else."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-11,Overall pretty solid,Pretty solid for the money. Have to “forget device” every time to connect. Little strange feeling in ear and do that weird vacuum effect where they suck into your ear. It’s strange. Sound quality is good though. Good purchase for the money.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-11,Decent choice for price,"Decent for the price, sound is a bit flat and lacks definition but excellent for a run or yard work. Good to use if you risk losing or ruining as the replacement price isn't something to concern yourself with."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,"Awesome sound, easy to use, charging case is just awesome with indicator.","Great headphones at best price. It is very comfortable, high quality sound, easy to carry/use with awesome battery life. I wanted a compact, waterproof, in-ear headphones. And finally I got it. I would just say one thing if you don’t want to waste 150$ on AirPods then this is the right option. It fits in very well, I use it in gym during all the exercises I do. I do a lot running and jumping ropes and this headphones during all the exercises stays in my ear very well. I do not have to adjust anytime during gym workouts. The sound is pretty awesome. It has awesome bass when I listen to music, watching movies. I was shocked to see the mic it has is doing a great job while I am talking to someone on phone. It connects to my phone quickly whenever I take it out from charging case. Th real worth of money is the charging case. It is pretty awesome to put the headphones in the charging case when not using. Because of it you don’t have to worry about losing the headphones. Battery life is really great and charging through charging case is very fast. Overall, great experience in using the headphones. Great quality sound, easy to carry, easy to use, great bass. Worth money."

EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-01-12,Amazing perfor.ance for their price range/,"I have been through a number of low priced earbuds. These are HANDS DOWN, the best of the bunch so far. Out of the box they pair easily. (iPnone) I think the sound is rather amazing, again for the price point. The Qi charging works wonderfully. Phone call quality is very good. Some people,, when asked have said I sound ""slight hollow"", but more than acceptable. I have yet to run them down in terms of battery life, and I use them perhaps 4-5 hours a day while at my desk. If I have any negative it is that they are slightly bulkier than some, but I will trade that cosmetic issue for the return I get. I am surprised at the negative reviews here and think maybe Ear Fun should review their QC. At any rate, I am very happy with the product. I would recommend them readily."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,"Good sound, long life, low price",These are great wireless earphones for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,Highly recommend them,my 16 yr old son is using these more than his beats bc they sound just as good and he isn’t as worried about them being stolen or losing them at sporting events and school.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-12,Great value for BT wireless buds,"Bought these for my wife so she could listen to her podcasts on her morning walks. They paired easily and work well with my wife's iPhone 10R. She likes to use the single right (master) ear bud so she can continue to be aware of her surroundings (guess that's an endorsement of the noise cancellation ability while wearing both buds.) My wife says they're comfortable and provide a secure fit for buds, more so than the previous versions of wired Apple earbuds she's used for years, which is an achievement given her small ears. Neither she nor I have put these buds to the test listening to music for long stretches, but I expect they'll perform fine. I'm not a picky audiophile, but the bass seems rich and the vocals/trebble clear for buds. Finally, the battery life on these buds has so far been outstanding. She's been using them for at least an hour a day for 3 weeks and has yet needed to recharge them with the USB power cord. The case, which also acts to recharge the buds between uses, still displays a full charge level."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,Great Sound,Great sound. Good fit. Easy to use.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-12,Great product,Great product teens love them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,Great wireless earbuds,👍👍👍
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,Great set of earbuds,Works exactly as described.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,I’m impressed,Wow. I guess I’ve never known what decent ear buds sound like. These are amazing. They totally block out external sound which took some getting used to. I really like how perfectly they fit in my ears. Very secure. I did sprints today and they never came loose. I’ve used this for a week and haven’t charged the case yet.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,Small sounds great.,Love the battery life and the rechargeable case. It's easy.to carry in your pocket.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-12,The worst!!,"Very very poor sound quality. Broken and distorted voices, hearing voices like someone’s talking from inside a cave! Not worth a penny cos it doesn’t serve the purpose! Definitely NOT recommending this to anyone!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Good for the price,"Pros
Good and easy Bluetooth connectivity
Very compact buds and case
sound & mic quality
Cons
Noise cancelling non consistent"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Great sound and doesn't fall off ear when at the gym,"Great sound, perfect fit that doesn't fall off,"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,"For the price, it is owsom.",Love the sound and the battery last forever.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Worth the money you paid for!!!,The quality of the product is very nice. It's not cheaply made. I used the device today at the gym and it did not fall out from my ears. Haven't tried the swimming yet but kinda scared too 😅 better than what I expected. The noise cancellation is amazing. Doesn't hurt my ears after 2 hrs of working out. It's worth the money you paid for compare to Air pods.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,"Amazing quality, Phenomenal price","I have been in the market for a good pair of wireless headphones at a reasonable prince. I wasn't too concerned with sound quality, I just needed then to work. However, I got way more than I even required. These sound great, stay put in my small ears even when I am running, and automatically pair with my device as soon as I take them out of the case. I love them. I had another pair of wireless earbuds and they were not user friendly at all! I am so happy I got this pair."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-13,Great quality! Affordable!,For the Price they cannot be beat. Great battery life and noise cancellation. Sound is crisp and clear. Only thing I wish was that they could get a little bit louder than their current max volume.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Noice cancelling perfect!,"I love that these come with three different sizes for the earbud cushions! I have a hard time with earbuds fitting my ears, but these fit nicely! They have a decent battery life, and I can listen to them as loud as I want without the people in the next cubicle hearing what I’m listening to."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,recommended,"I gave to my wife for Christmas some 90 dls beats. and I can't believe that these are heard better than the bets, I love the sound of the bass 👌🏻 and the battery lasts a lot"

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Top quality.,Easy to set up. Great sound quality. Good value for your money.
EarFun,Free,2,0,2020-01-13,Not that great.,These didn't fit well and were heavy and kept falling out when Very disappointing.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Superb True Wireless Earbuds!!,I have had many different earphones in the past and this is the first time I ever switched to a true wireless earbud and I couldn't be happier with the purchase! The sound quality is just way above what I expected and the noise cancellation is great on these pairs. I feel sometimes there might be small Bluetooth connection issues but I'm guessing it might be more because of my phone rather than these earbuds itself. Overall great value for the money you pay. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Good product,I like it
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-13,MINOR NUISANCES...but yeah...They’re less than $50 bucks.,"Cons:
-Needs a rubber coating for better grip during case removal. -Case itself could use a rubber coating for a less cheap feel. -Max volume still leaves you wanting more. For the size and advertised driver size. It needs a higher Max(at least on iPhone)
-Left ear bud sounds louder than the right(confirmed by two other people). -While listening to Pandora I had to hit pause/play through the app in order to start music again. The earbud buttons wouldn’t play the music(maybe a Pandora issue). LISTEN...for sub-$50 buds these are pretty good for what you get. It has a small case, Usb-C/wireless charging, pretty good noise isolation, secure fit even though they are kinda big(ran 3 miles and lifted no issue), and IPX7 waterproofing. Yes there are some minor issues/nuisances, but again for less than $50 bucks, it hits a lot of the big wants/needs of most people. I might try some other buds with the same features but that list is short."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Great Buy!,I bought for my bf... he was set on buying the expensive ones and I love to go by reviews on products. All in all he loves the product.....Great Buy!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-14,Mic is soft/low . MSRP is 49.99,"I thought these were on a 30% discount, which would indicate a higher MSRP and higher quality product, but the manufacturer website sells these for 49.99, so it really wasn't a big discount, the prices are misleading. I wanted to use these for sales calls. The Mic is too soft, people complain that it's too hard to hear me. Especially on conference calls / dial-in calls. These are great for exercising, and will become my 'exercise' earbuds. I take away 1 star for misleading prices & poor Microphone."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-14,"Okay, not great","Bluetooth is inconsistent, goes into power saving mode at awkward times if not in constant use. You have to take the right earbud out of the case even if you only want to use the left earbud. They are not independent of each other. (Left one is a 'slave' to the right earbud.)"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-14,Great product!,"I LOVE these earbuds! They sound great, come with different sized earpieces for a perfect fit and the charge they hold is great! They're also idiot-friendly, because I can't pair socks but I could pair these. You won't be disappointed."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-14,Bluetooth earbuds,"Love these, it was easy to attach to my phone. It also came really fast. I would order these again and I have an android phone."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-14,Comfortable fit works great,"I got this earbuds to replace my lost ones. I like that they fit comfortably in my ears without causing any discomfort. It's also great knowing they are water proof . It came in a nice looking compact case that is also a charging case. The sound quality is superb and great noise cancellation , although I can still hear my kids which is great . The only thing I dont like about it is that it doesnt have a button to end calls on it . All in all great earbuds that came for a decent amount. Highly recommended"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-14,Worth the money!,Great product!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-14,Love!!,Amazing headphones for a really decent price! I can’t hear anything other than my music when in use-noise canceling is there! I’m pretty sure they charge on solar light (lol joking) because I haven’t charged them in a week & they’re fully charged (I use them every day in short intervals). Don’t waste your money on branded headphones. These are just as great & cost less!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-14,"Good for active lifestyle, easy tech, great price","Great headphones for every day things and for what I was looking for- a set to work out with. I always have trouble with headphones staying in my ears so I was skeptical about bulky looking wireless headphones. However, I’m very surprised and pleased with these. They fit my ears well (I use the medium sized earpiece) but it comes with S, M, L. They aren’t as bulky as I felt the pictures seemed and they aren’t heavy. So far I’ve done a 3 mile outdoor/trail run, an at home HIIT workout, and a couple sweaty gym sessions and they worked very well with all. The only exercise I had A bit of trouble with were Burpee’s but they still didn’t fall out, just kind of got loose. The technical side was very easy, and I am not a very tech savvy person. Pairing them with my phone was a breeze and the control to play, switch songs, and control volume are straightforward. The battery life is good, and I like that the case they sit in holds a charge too. Overall I think this is a really good product no matter what your needs are with headphones and a very good price"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-14,Good value for the price,**Update** I’ve tested in the shower for the last few days now and yes it’s water proof and still working. Pro - Just like what most YouTuber have said if you did watch videos on it. Con - You’ll look like Frankenstein.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-15,They work,"I have no experience with high end cordless in or over the ear earphones. Having said that these are the best truely cordless ear phones I’ve ever owned. They sound great they look cool (enough for me) they connect with as little hassle as possible. I can use them individually and they still sound like stero even though I know they can’t. (At least I don’t think so). Now the left one has popped out by itself twice but I’m so enamored by all the stuff that works I’ll gleefully work on that later, still have two sockets and two dimmers to contend with."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-15,#1 earbuds for those on a budget that want great quality as well,I absolutely love these earbuds. The sound quality is superb and they have made my life so much easier. The functions are super simple. It's either one two or three pushes to do various tasks. The wireless charging is the best feature in my opinion. My case has even been lower than 50 since I got it and I have used it for hours on end. The case fits so well in my pocket and does not feel bulky at all. It looks and feels as if I would've paid hundreds of $$$ for it but you cant beat this price! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-15,"Awesome battery, Chinese suck","I've been using them everyday since I got them last Friday 1/10 and the battery indicator on the case is at 3 dots still. Also they are great in the shower. Side note, I bought a pair of tozo T10, Amazon probably won't let the review through but the Chinese can suck it with their review farms and cheap inferior products. I won't be fooled again. :P"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-15,Good,Good product
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-15,I'm very happy with these little guys,"These little guys were cheap, they seem solidly constructed, they slip right in to the charging case easily, and, so far, maintain their charge over a long period of time. I am not an audiophile, though, so I can't really comment in that regard. I usually only use one bud while I'm running and listen to podcasts or Audible. I'm traveling by air soon, so I'll have a chance to test out noise cancellation and musical sound fidelity and will update this review accordingly."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-01-15,Excellent earbuds.,"Sound quality is excellent. These earbuds block sound as well as I can expect from non-ANC. I generally use just the right side one, and have gone 6+ hours with my phone still telling me I had 60% battery remaining. I purchased these as a lightning deal, but I would consider them to be worth the regular price."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-15,Could be better,I really wanted to believe that this Earbuds would actually stand out from the rest but unfortunately they suffer from the same issues as the rest of them. Most importantly Bluetooth connections keep getting dropped when walking outside (connected to phone in my coat packet). Secondly base is almost no existent here. And lastly they way more balkier then others in this group.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-15,Fun Earbuds,Love the base sound that the earbuds produce need to work on the noise cancelling. Other than that they work fine. I use them for talking and music.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-15,Underdog Earbuds,This are the best truly wireless earbuds I have ever owned 🙏👌
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,They stay put and last forever,"They are awesome! Sound great, charge fast, and won't fall out of your ears"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-16,Good quality but bass didn't hit the mark for me.,I thought the earbuds were ok. I was looking for more of a bass profile.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Convenient.,Sound good. Battery faster. Good price. It won't make you disappointed.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,"Great wireless earbuds, highly recommended","Sound quality is great and noise cancellation almost perfect. The case is super small, supports wireless charging and it's type C, great features for the value. I was worried about the fit, had problems in the past with other earbuds but this pair fit perfectly. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Best beats and battery life,Smart earbuds. No need to turn on or off after use. It will turn itself on when you take it out and will turn off and charge when you insert it back to the charging case. It comes with four earbuds sizes and usb C to charge. You can charge it wirelessly.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-16,Just OK.,Sound is okay but it's not loud as my other earbuds also bought from Amazon at the same price range.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Very satisfied,Great battery life havent charged them since I first got them. They stay in your ear very well I'm super surprised honestly for the price. Would recommend to anyone
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-16,Painfully sharp audio quality + headache inducing design. Genuinely concerned for my ears.,"Pros: The battery life is exactly as advertised. Cons: Noise cancellation sort of works if you stuff the ear buds as far into your canal as they can go... but I can literally hear my own heart beat at that point and it gives me a headache. If you don't shove them into your ears, they will fall out. Even just the action of chewing my lunch will push them out. (I have tried all three sizes of ear plug)
-Sound quality is painfully sharp with little bass response. I actually grew concerned after experiencing painful tinnitus in my ears on my commute home after using the headphones all day at work. If you use them for more than two hours at a time, they will without fail, start to glitch and become unusable. I troubleshot the problem by testing my other headphones with the same computer and the glitching only occurred when using the earfun buds. ***2 stars because, yes, it is literally a pair of bluetooth headphones with a battery life of six hours. -3 stars for poor audio quality, glitches that render them unusable and legitimately painful, tinnitus inducing design. Protect your ears!!! Pick different headphones. ***"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Best bang for buck,Great sound quality. Lots of bass. Really surprised the quality these deliver for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Great buy,Great product. Very happy with sound and performance.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Love these earbuds,They are very nice
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Great sound quality and great battery life,These have been the best headphones I have gotten. The sound is great and super loud when needed. Everyone else can hear me really well on them too. I have only had the charge the case once since I have gotten them almost two to three weeks ago.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Great Earbuds with tight fit for excellent noise cancellation,"This is a great wireless Bluetooth 5.0 earbud. It comes with a nice charging case, with basic power level display. The sound is very good. The case is handy to keep safe and recharge the earbuds. The earbuds are rated to last 6hrs and the case can recharge 4 times. The case can be wirelessly charged or with a USB-C cable. The earbuds are IPX-7 waterproof. The Earbuds fit tightly inside your ear and block out almost all outside sound. The earbuds contain a microphone and can be used to for audio calls when paired with a phone. The sound quality is very good and louder then other earbuds that I have tried. ❤ LIKES:
Easy to pair
Great and loud sound quality
Tight fit to block out all sound
Charges Wirelessly"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-17,Great product for the money,"These were purchased mainly to use in the gym. So far they have endured sweat and running with no issues. They fit my ears well and have not once come loose or fallen out. Sound quality is very good with more than adequate bass, and I have yet to run the battery down with listening. The charging case is a nice small size, easy to carry in a pocket or gym bag. Great product and not so expensive you have to baby them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-17,Great sound!,"These earbuds have surpassed my expectations! The sound is amazing and the battery life has been outstanding. Had no issue paring them right out of the box with my phone. I have only had them for a few days, but so far I've been impressed!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-17,Pleasantly Surprised!,I love these earbuds. The sound quality is excellent and they are so comfortable.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-17,Best priced/quality earbuds.,"Great quality earbuds for the price, and their waterproof in the shower! Only complaint my 12 yr old has is that they're slightly more bulky than air pods but he can deal with that and he loves them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-17,Great quality for the price,"Way better than I thought they would be. They have good sound quality, with nice bass. I was pleased to find out they are pretty loud, my old plantronics just never got loud enough at the gym, which was very annoying. I am definitely pleased with the quality and the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-17,Great product,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these ear buds. The sound is great, easy to set up on my phone and the fit is very good. They are much more comfortable than my Apple air pods. Love the wireless charging feature, just set the case on a wireless charger and they start charging right away. For the price point, these are fantastic. Get them, you won't be disappointed."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-17,device defective,One ear bud does not work
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-17,great price on very good ear buds,"Read a good review, and could not pass up the deal. I was worried about the ear buds falling out (a constant problem with some of my previous in-ear head phones. But I hate those wired ones I have been putting up with. I have been wearing these new ear buds out on my walks and while exercising. Comfortable, they stay in my ears, bluetooth pairing is so easy, and they play for hours before charging. And to charge them you just pop them back in the charging case. Sweet! I am not up-to-speed on the multiple taps and long holds for pause/play/forward/reverse/volume, so I'm still relying on my smart phone. I'm sure I'll get used to the ear bud controls soon. I already know I will never go back to those wired headphones. Freedom!! !"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-18,Great cheap wireless air buds,Overall this wireless air buds are great for the price. They seem to be well built (both the air buds and case). The sound is just above average. Bass is not as loud as I would like to be but sound is clear and good. I had to change the silicone air pieces to fit properly which also improved sound quality. My Samsung S9 pairs with it seamlessly.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Big difference vs cheap ones,"I first bought one ob left like 25 bucks for the gym. Man i did not like the tapping it was wayy to sensitive, when i adjust it it pauses it wasnt type c and charge wasnt amazing. I bought these next day because type c and quick charge man its a big difference. It is like night and day sound quality better comes with different size buds no carry bag or anything and tapping is more like press click which is amazing!"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-18,I phone 7 Phone conversation quality is unacceptable.,Did not pair with my iPhone 7+ well. Music listening sound quality was good but phone conversation was unacceptable.It was echoed and cracked during phone conversations. I end up returning it.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Buy these I'm shocked at the high quality.,"Wow, I have Jay bird wireless, airpods, and beats. These absolutely crush all of the competition. Deep bass Crystal treble. Highs super clear lows super deep and crisp. I'm shocked. My phone gets a solid connection over 250 fr away in another room. I'm blown away at how precise and perfect the sound and tech is. Oh and they don't hurt your ears . Yessssss. Buy them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Quality earbuds at budget price !!,"i waited and bought the new Apple Airpods Pro but was extremely sad that it failed earfit test. I returned it at a nearby Apple store and decided to buy these low price earbuds for interim use till Boss releases their 2020 model. I read reviews before making up my mind. I am surprised and happy to say that the earfun free earbuds are more than what I expected. I use it with my iPhone for music, iPad to watch movies and with MacBook Pro for Skype business meetings. It doesn't disconnect, has a good bluetooth range to make coffee while still on call 15 ft away, decent music - not to be compared with Bose- but is definitely money's worth, and most importantly provides a good seal without slipping from ears. I am using tips that came with the earbuds, do see a couple of different other sizes in the original package in case one gets loose. Good experience so far 👍
Update (02/28/2020): I never write reviews for all products and definitely haven’t updated reviews. I wanted to make a special mention here. I had to reach out to the EarFun customer service team as I lost an ear piece. Customer service was prompt in their responses and extremely helpful. Since I was traveling to Canada for business, they even shipped replacement product through their Canadian Warehouse. That is going out of way to help. I thought it was one unique experience."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-18,Great for bigger ear,Sound is good bt little big for small ear.. keep falling .
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-18,Doesn't always connect correctly.,"The right earbud seems to be the primary, and the left one won't connect without the right (I prefer to have one ear free most times). They also become disconnected every 20min or so, and I have to wake them back up again."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Perfect Ear Buds!!,I absolutely loves these ear buds!! I work in open office and use my cell phone for business calls so these buds are great for being hands free!! The sound is awesome and no on every complains that they can hear or understand me!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Great battery life,Work great
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,"Small, effective and good quality","Absolute bargain, the sound quality is brilliant, very steady and sturdy, I used in the gym they never fallout, the actually better than some of the high end over priced devices you see on the market today , love them"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Great wireless headphones!,"Love these. They fit and stay in surprising well. My old headphones would disconnect if my phone wasn’t on me or at least within an arms reach, but these stay connected even when I go upstairs into a room. Oh, and the most important thing - they sound great!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Probably the best of the bunch,"Great earbuds. They make a tight seal and have rumbling bass response along with good treble and mids! These are comparable to soundpeats dual drivers, but have USB c, wireless charging and are ipx7 rated."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-18,Amazing sound quality for great price,"Amazing Bluetooth earbuds, I have used many earbuds but these are best amongst all. Worth for price."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-19,Balanced sound if they fit your ears,"I wasn't able to get a good solid seal with these earbuds. And none of my foams would fit it, so I don't want to trash the earbud for my weird situation. When I did have a decent seal they sounded pretty balanced with nothing to remark on other than they sound good with no harshness. But if I open my mouth or turn my head I lose seal. After about an hour of using them my ears would start to hurt (probably because I was pushing them in and twisting so often). My daughter has them now and she hasn't complained so I guess she's good with them, because at 12 years old I hear every complaint. EarFun is brand I like, especially their bluetooth speakers. Check them out if you are in the market for some."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Awesome value!,"Outstanding BT earbuds for sound, value, connectivity & comfort. No volume control & average battery life. Really love the sound quality. Wore them under water for 10 seconds without any consequences. See CNET review."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-19,These are great,"I am trying to find something bad to say about these, but nothing is coming to mind. Maybe they are too small lol? Sound is great, build quality looks great, charging is fast and easy. These are my first true wireless buds and I am loving them. EDIT: taking away 1 star for 2 reasons. First, the buds do start to hurt my ears after a while, somewhere around 30-60 minutes). Second, there is no way to adjust the sound. I think the sound is good and mostly don't care to try to change it, but on certain songs it would be nice to turn the bass up or down. Wouldn't have to be a full blown equalizer, the JBuds I looked at had 3 presets which would probably be fine."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Worth the price for a new one,"Battery life is amazingly long! Great connectivity. Brought another pair as a gift. Good thing I checked, the charging case was NOT new, have 4 scratches throughout."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Good sound,they sound good in the battery life seems to be pretty good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Good,Every thing is good for this price! But it’s bigger than the picture or my ear is small?
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-19,Good value in a set of wireless earbuds,"Bought 4 pairs of these. Three pairs are used constantly. When I first put mine in the ear, it was unexpected. The sound quality was good and I could hear very little outside noise. After some time they started to feel a little uncomfortable (perhaps a couple of hours, also please note I'm an older man so I was not used to having something in my ear for a long period of time). I tried swapping out the inserts for a smaller pair. Afterwards, I could hear more external noise and the sound quality suffered. I guess what I'm trying to say is that my satisfaction with the sound performance is directly tied to how tightly they are fitted within the ear canal. I've accepted this and put the larger inserts back on. Now I use them for an hour at a time when working or listening to music and then take a break. Battery life is great. I've only had to charge the case once since Christmas. The ear buds themselves have never been below 60%, according to phone. My kids use the other two pairs and use them all of the time. They seem very satisfied. UPDATE: Jan 25th
Okay... An update on battery life. Spent the afternoon in a crowded area with a very loud sound system. Regardless of the reason for not paying attention to what is going on at this particular event, I chose to listen to Spotify during the event. These buds have been great. I have very few complaints. Had them in for about 3 hours. Current battery life still shows around 70%. The tight fit in my ear has all but blocked the external sound (it was very loud). I'm happy I brought them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Best budget ear phone ever,"What I loved with this earphone:
1. Audio quality is awesome
2. Lower price

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Perfect fit,Perfectly fit in ears without hurting. I was really not expecting for these to be of this great quality. Bought ones from walmart for double price and those stopped working in 3 months. Noise cancellation is great. Definately worth it for money spent
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,gREAT 4 DA $:-),Works as it should.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,They Really Work,"They work as advertised. Comfortable , Great Sound Instant pairing / No Need to pair with each use
Worth The Price"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,Great produce for the price!,Fit nice and sound quality is good. I like the wireless charging too
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,Worth it,These were so worth the money!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,Best wireless headphones for the money,Very good customer service. My only complaint is that you cannot use just the left earbud by itself. The headset only connects through Bluetooth when the right bud is removed from the case.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-20,A good wireless earbud but has it's down side.,Definitely a good wireless earbud but i had problems with mine. It would lag when playing YouTube it wasn't my internet and i use poweramp pro to play my music and it would lag on their too and it wasn't using wifi.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,Great earbuds for the price,"Sound is great, although you need to have the volume up a little louder than wired headphones. Great earbuds for the price."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-20,Very little improvement,"The battery life is amazing . Have not had to charge them since I bought them, but perhaps that’s because I hardly use them since they won’t stay in my ears even with the larger adapter!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-20,Great for music but NOT phone calls.,They cancel noise and work well for music and shows while working out or just normal life. The noise cancelation feature also seems to cancel out your voice so callers don't hear background noises as much but they can't hear me speaking either.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,Quality earbuds,"Good earbuds. I have been using these most days since received. I most often use these at work or while using public transit. The sound quality is good. I like the charger, the earbuds charge quickly. I like how they immediately pair to my phone when removed from the case. They fell out of my ear a couple times, which was mostly my fault putting up a jacket hood on rainy days. I paid $35 for these. The price was right and I have been pleased with the build quality."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-21,Stylish earphones,"The earphones look very stylish, they come with a charging case that is pocket size. Easy to pair and good sound. Will update the review once I test the battery life!"

EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-21,Good product just have a mild complaint,"Product was great, good battery, connectivity range.. my only complaint is it doesnt go as loud as I want it to. Other than that solid ear buds pick"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-21,Awesome earbuds,"I did not expect these earbuds to be that good for the price, yes I recommend this product."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-21,earfun not fun,volume is super low and not real clear.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-21,Best budget friendly earbuds.,"Loving these little fellas. They look smart, carry case has lights to let you know how much charge you have left. The ear buds themselves have the l & r to help with ease of putting them in. They fit me perfect but do come with an additional 2 pairs of covers to help for smaller ear canals. Pairing to devices took minutes. Comes in a perfect packaging and the charging case is remarkably small and indicates the battery level perfectly."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-21,Ear Juice,Awesome ear juice from these little black fun nuggets. No need to acknowledge anyone in the gym with old school Tool pumping tunes directly into my brain stem. Feels a little bulky like I got a couple kitchen cabinet knobs sticking out my ears but no handles for Mary Lou to do uneven bars or anything like that.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-21,One of the few headphones with wireless charging/USB-C in its price range,"I was looking to buy a pair of budget wireless headphones and the vast majority of the ones you'll find do NOT have USB-C. Even the ones from the relatively well-known budget brands like Anker seem to mostly sell earbuds with micro-USB or USB-A (wide USB) charging connector, without wireless charging capabilities. But obviously the charging connectivity is not as important as the actual sound quality, so I was worried about having a tinny or flat sound. Fortunately, I need not have been concerned -- these are absolutely amazing for the price. The mids are clear and expansive, the highs are vibrant without being tinny, and the lows are solid. These are advertised as ""Deep Bass,"" which I think is not accurate -- the response seems fairly even on the low-end, which is generally what you want (otherwise the lows may distort the sound for you). Battery life is solid but unremarkable. It's advertised as 30 hours of playtime, which I think is probably an exaggeration. But it's certainly comparable to other wireless headsets -- with how light they are, you have to be realistic about battery lifetime. The fit for me is great -- there are different-sized eartips included in the box, but the default ones worked fine for me so I never needed to try the other sizes. Overall, the feature set and sound quality of these is equivalent to earbuds selling for roughly double the price. This is an excellent buy, and highly recommended."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-21,Decent for the price,"The bass end is a tad low, but overall, I like them. Three pushes to advance songs and two pushes to increase volume should be switched, but that's more a preference."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-21,Good sound block,"It blocks the sound very good, but battery life is not that much good. However charger unit supports it well. All in all good device for it's price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-22,Wireless charging is a godsend at this price range.,"The products work really well with my Galaxy S10e, and the sound quality is amazing! Only pitfall is that range isn't super good with my phone, but I can charge the device using the wireless charging pads I have around my house without plugging anything in."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-22,Great cheap buds,I would give these a 5 but sometimes you have to reset them. The sound starts cutting in and out.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-22,They’re great,They’re great.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-22,Save your money,"I returned these. Less than a week after they arrived the right one’s sound output dropped dramatically. I was also was not impressed with the charging case. It worked, but the lid looked way too lightweight in comparison to say my Apple AirPod case. Long term I was worried it would break too easily, but I’ll never know since I’ve returned them"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-23,Fine Product with one exception,"When trying to connect to a second device, you have to first disable the bluetooth setting on the first device. I wished that this bluetooth could automatically disconnect from the first device., otherwise so far it works fine. My first set of Earfun buds were defective so I got a refund and said forget it. If it wasn't for Earfun customer support reaching out to me, I would not have tried them again."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-23,Long Term Charging Problems,"This is my second pair of Ear Fun Frees, the first pair was purchased off indigogo as a backer and I was instantly impressed with them. I have owned headphones ranging in price from $10 up to $350. I can't say that these held up to headphones at the top of this range in some areas, but in others, it did just as well or outperformed. The sound quality was surprisingly solid for the price, the bass was good but not too much, mids were there and highs weren't blown out. Comfort was good too, I wear these all day every day at college. Walking to and from class, doing work, at the gym, sitting around. I listen to music all the time, and only very rarely did I ever feel the need to take them out of my ears. The case was small but packed extra charges and the USB-C charging is a godsend having both a pixel and computer that charge using USB-C. I don't use the wireless charging but I was impressed that it was included for the price. As I mentioned earlier this is my second pair of the earbuds, this is because about 4-5 months after receiving the first pair in the mail they began to stop making good contact with the chaging pins. I am not sure what the issue was or how it was caused, I tried cleaning the headphones and case and I tried resetting them. The headphones would charge, but they also would stop and turn on ALL THE TIME. If I was using another pair of my headphones, in my car, or even just watching something through my phone's speakers the headphones would almost every time turn on in my pocket and force me to either turn off bluetooth or disconnect from the headphones manually as just placing them back in the case would turn them off for just a few seconds and then the same issue would occur. Now I would like to pride Ear Fun for their customer service, I emailed them and very quickly I got a response that was apologetic with some suggestions as to how it could be fixed. After exhausting those options with no avail they helped me to get a new pair. I chalked a lot of the first pair's issues to it being an early production unit and it seemed that way from the second I received the second pair, the case was matte, not glossy, the buttons were easier to press and much more ""clicky"" causing less pressure on the ear when changing songs or pausing the music. Again I was very happy with my purchase, and again after a short period, the same issues began to appear. I have been using this pair with the same problems for about one month and earlier today I officially gave up on this pair. The right earbud stopped charging in the case unless I precisely placed it in and left the case on a steady table so it was not jostled at all. This to me takes away the entire point of fully wireless earbuds and for the moment will go back to an older pair with worse sound, build quality, features, and functionality. I honestly wanted these to be great and I still have faith because of their customer service. I don't know if my experience is unique or common but for me to give up on a piece of my technology that I use every day takes a lot, but if I can not consistently have charge in my headphones when I want it (assuming it is not my fault for not charging them in the first place) then I will have to carry around an extra pair of headphone everywhere. As I have for the past 3 weeks at college. I realize this is just an inconvenience, but it is the most basic functionality that stopped working on the headphones, not something that could easily be ignored. This problem affected my daily life in a major way, it changed how I interacted with my phone, the battery would not last as long, and I would have to think about if my headphones would connect to my phone while I was trying to use it. Sorry, this was long but I hope it helped."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-23,Cheap earbuds but still a good product,"This earbuds is so cheap as compared to others but it met my expectations. Firstly, the pairing is very fast no matter I use Samsung or Iphone. As soon as I put the earbuds on my ears, it is connected. Then the sound cancellation is amazing as I did not hear anything my friend said when I was listening to music with this earbuds. Next, the design and the case is so cool. The battery life is longer than I thought as I can use it all night. The sound is good as other earphones. Last but not least, it did not fall off even when I worked out or running. The price is cheaper than many other earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-23,Works great for the price,I've been using them for a couple of months and still like them.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-23,Excellent Sound ... Great Price!!,"I love having NO wiring that connects my smartphone Napster music app directly to my ears! Next, these NEW ""sound enhancers"" greatly improve my music listening experience with my Samsung Galaxy S10. These ""sound enhancers"" are great at the gym!! BTW, the price is very gentle, too."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-23,"Solid buds, freedom of no wires","These earbuds work very well to block noise and I find the sound quality to be very good. They are lightweight and much better than my old wired bluetooth earbuds. Glad that technology has changed. Bluetooth connection is solid when walking, however with light jog connection was glitchy. Wireless charging capacity is nice. The size allows for good battery life. I actually like that the earbuds are center click type buttons instead touch sensitive earbuds. Other cons so far is that the casing rests on the helix crus on my ear causing soreness. Limited to 30 min of use. Hopefully, they get more comfortable as time passes. But may end up sanding as most earbuds seem to be of similar design except for the airpod style buds. Left side fit nicely but right ear bud feels loose despite changing tips."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-23,"Good sound, terrible mic....","I bought these to use when playing mobile games - Discord chat, etc. The sound is decent enough and “noise cancellation” seems to be more a matter of how well they plug and fill your ear than anything else. The case is nice, they seem to hold a decent charge as well. That ticked most of the boxes for me until...no one can hear me when I talk! I tested it both with Discord and regular phone calls on my iPhone X - same results. Pretty disappointing. A poor mic is a deal breaker for me, so these are being returned to Amazon. :-("
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-23,Quality and low price,"Fast delivery. Light weight, comfortable
Inexpensive"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-23,"Great for a backup pair, could have better sound","I gave this a 4 star because this set of earbuds checks so many boxes its crazy but it falls short in the one thing it is expected to do, and that is the sound quality. Wireless charging? Check. Long life on the ear buds and case? Check. Comfortable in ears? Check. USB C charging? Check. Magnetic bonding between buds and case? Check. Charging level indicators? Check. They easily have features that ear buds costing three times as much fall short on. But the sound on it isn't that good. I keep them in my gym bag and they have held up well with the heat and sweat from hard workouts. If they improved the volume and bass I would bump this up. Used while on the phone is not that great, but it got the job done. If they come out with an improved version I am definitely buying it."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-24,Best earbud,👍👍👍👍👍👍
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Sound quality,"At this price point the sound is excellent, as is the battery life. Easy wireless charging is a nice bonus too."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-01-24,Stopped working!,They didn’t even last a month! Left earbud stop working. Return for a refund.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Wao,Blew my mind amazing earbuds.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Good product,"Good sound,good price"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,You are paying for Quality!,Love this product! Use them when I'm working and they are great for blocking out loud noises! Fit comfortable in my ears and sound great! Best purchase for earbuds/headphones
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Very impressed with these earbuds!,"I decided to get these earbuds after a review from a tech site I read daily. I was a little skeptical due to all the features and the relatively inexpensive cost. I came from a pair of Bose Soundsport that were amazing, but broke after almost 5 years of almost daily use. Once I got these and we're fully charged, I paired them to my phone and tested them... I was extremely impressed with the fit and sound quality for a third of the cost of the Bose. They are incredibly light. Create a good seal of the ear canal which helps tremendously on noice cancellation. They definitely go deeper than what I was used to with my Bose, but it was still incredibly comfortable with no ear fatigue after about 5 hours of straight use. I really thought I was going to miss my Bose, but just after one day I already know I won't miss anything. My only critique is that I wish they would work independently while the other bud charges. The right earbud is the master so you can't use the left one if the right is charging (since it automatically turns off)
Fantastic product!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Excellent sound and bass for price point.,"Volume, base, and clarity very good for the price point. Returned a pair of Jlab earbuds that I bought at same time because the sound didn’t compare to these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Really loved these,I really loved these earbuds they are really really good for the price would highly recommend.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-24,For consumers that's on the budget this is definitely the right earphone,The price is right. And also they fit real snug inside my ears
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,A Steal of a Deal.,"Best fit ever, easy pairing and realistic bass. Great sounding ear buds. Even better price under $50. Several hours of playback with charging case."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Changed rating,I bought this product in July 2019 and although it worked great until 20 Jan 2020 the left ear bud will no longer charge. Since I submitted my rating of a 1 star I have changed it to 5 stars because I had contacted the product's customer assistance and they were terrific. They first provided trouble shooting steps and when that failed to correct the problem they offered to return my money or send a new pair. I chose the new pair because I think it is a great product for the money and works well. The customer service is great and very helpful.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Value purchase would purchase again,Been using them for awhile now there perfect only slight issue is cant use the left earpod only have to be using the right earpod also.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Good Bass and Treble,I was ready to return because of tinny sound. Turns out it was not in my ear correctly. Good thing I tried it again and was impressed with the sound
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Ear buds fit my ear perfect,"Excellent ear buds for the price , they look nicer in ear then Apple pods."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Awesome ear phone’s,Love love love them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Incredible value,"My first wireless earphones, and I love them. No more tangle of wires. Good quality sound. Great value."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Love them.,"Great value, see no reason to spend more. Very pleased, pairs instantly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Good audio quality,Very reliable. Easily paired with my phone.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Great value.,"Great value for price. Excellent sound. Fantastic waterproofing. Would’ve been nice to have volume control on the Earbud itself, and active noise cancellation feature, but the trade-offs are well worth it given the incredible quality otherwise"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-25,Good Sound / Poor Microphone,"I lost my wired earphones for my iphone. SO - I turned to these as a ""great"" replacement. It all sounded like it would be great. Wireless charging case is cool. Waterproof...cool. The video made it seem like they would be super comfortable and easy to use. Ok they are somewhat comfortable. I don't feel like they will fall out of my ears. But the buttons on the buds are less than ideal. In order to push the button you have push the bud in toward your ear canal - which doesn't feel great. The buttons work well paired to the music on my iphone. Starts and stops the music easily. The sound quality is quite good. HOWEVER, I've tried to use these to talk to SIRI. Couldn't get that to work. I made some phone calls...and people said every other word was lost. After that I tried to call my voicemail to test it by leaving a message. The voicemail kept saying it was not getting any input. If you want these ONLY as wireless earphones - they might work out well for you. They have NOT worked out well for me in my attempt to replace the earphones that came with my iphone - to use on conference calls."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,EarFun Free,"Comfortable fit, decent sound and good price, recommended!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Great sound and fit.,"Very good sound. They fit nicely, very light. I have several wireless earbuds and these are my favorite."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Buy these NOW for yourself & everyone else you know!!,"I’m adding my high praise For these Bluetooth earbuds to all the others. These are truly the easiest electronic device I’ve ever used in my entire life. These are perfect for everyone but I think they’re particularly great for someone who’s older or in any way “device challenged”. In addition, the sound quality is incredible, especially at this ridiculously low price point. Kudos & a big thanks to EarFun Free!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Great Product and Customer Service,"Bought based on CNET review. These are my first wireless Bluetooth earbuds (or headphones) and, despite an initial right bud arriving DOA, Customer Service was very good and I’m now very happy with this purchase. Sound quality is very clear, balanced in frequency range and volume between the 2 buds, and, at its loudest, not overly loud, but just enough. While I’m wary of whether it might not be loud enough at times, I also appreciate that I’m not likely to accidentally lose my hearing. I’m using these buds with a HOTT CD611T CS Player and its volume output co-controls the buds’ output. Pairing was easy. They appear large but they were comfortable and don’t fall out on long walks, with the medium tips. Surfaces are smooth and, at time, hard to handle. Larger and smaller pairs of tips were also provided."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Boyfriend seems to like them,He has no complaints takes them to the gym all the time.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Plesently surprised.,"The Buds are great, the sound is not going to be better then more expensive brands, but the quality is still good, they are fairly loud, with good enough bass, clear mids and highs. Battery is good they will last about 6 hours with continous listening. Overall a good product for the price and would recommend."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-26,An okay set of Bluetooth earbuds,They are somewhat quiet with max volume in barely sounds like I have it halfway compare to my other Bluetooth earbuds noise cancellation is there when you have something playing battery life last about 4 to 5 hours of playtime and after an hour they start to hurt your ears not very comfortable
EarFun,Free,4,0,2020-01-26,Great earbuds overall,"They are a bit bulky but it doesn’t matter unless you want to sleep in them. If you have an iPhone that’s at least a 6s, then they may not work correctly. Recently bought an iPhone 8 and they work fine but the audio would glitch with my 6s phone. Noise cancelation is good and the audio is something I can’t complain about either."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Happy in Cali,"Product was well packaged, works as described in add, little challenging to hook up to iPhone otherwise great"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Good value!,I feel like I have gone through dozens of headphones and can’t justify the price of the expensive white you know what. These ear fun work great and I am an athlete. They are secure and sweat proof.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-27,Great Ear Buds,These are great wireless ear buds for the price! I didn’t know they were noise cancelling at first until I put them in and I couldn’t hear anything! They’re great for the gym as they fit snug and cancel out the noises around you. I also like that the charging case can be charged through wireless charging. The battery life is great too. I’ve been using them for about 2 weeks for my workouts (about 40 minutes 3 times a week) and for 30 minutes-1 hour a couple of nights and I haven’t had to charge them yet. The only reason I took off a star is because I’ve had issues with one of the ear buds not pairing occasionally. It’s an easy fix but annoying when I don’t realize it at first and have to go put them back in their case to reset them. Overall though they’re a great option for the price!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Good deal,Great earbuds!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Good product,"I did not find much in the way of noise cancellation, somewhat difficult to place into ear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,great product,easy to use
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,working great I love it,working great I love it
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-27,Good for music not so much for phone calls,"Very nice ear piece if you are looking for something to listen to music only. Would not recommend for those who need it for taking calls as everyone kept complaining my voice was muffled or they could not understand what I was saying. Hate to but I have to return this because I needed them for making calls primarily. Otherwise noise cancellation is top, battery life good and fit snugly in as well."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Great customer service!,I was able to get a replacement when my previous left earbud suddenly stopped working. Their customer service is on point! I received the replacement very quickly and it works perfectly now. Love these earbuds! Even my brother bought a pair after trying out mine.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Great quality for great price,"These are comfortable. I forget it is in my left ear. I love it. The volume could be higher to talk on the phone while driving, but overall I am extremely satisfied and happy!! Well worth the money. This is all I use now."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Very very good for the price.,Fantastic!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,They fit!,I haven't used them long enough to test the battery charging. But they fit my ears comfortably and sound great. I love that each ear is independent.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Excellent sound at a great price.,These ear buds are awesome. I love the rich sound they reproduce. These buds produce low bass and clear voice. The battery life is also excellent; even the standbye battery time from the case is great. I recommend them to my friends all the time.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Amazing!,"These earbuds are absolutely outstanding. Despite their low price, they provide easy pairing, comfortable in ear sound, and long battery life like no other wireless earbuds I've ever had. When I began using these, I immediately ditched my other pair of Haylou earbuds to make this pair my main daily driver. They're amazing!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Great sound good battery life,Bought these for my wife sea could listen to music on her tablet and have ear but connections on her phone she really liked them pretty much wore them the whole first day. Connection to Bluetooth was easy. Great sound. I liked her feedback so much I ordered myself a pair
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-27,Issues going into charging mode.,The master earbud is having trouble connecting to the charger. It will sit inside the charger and drain both the charger and itself trying to connect to the phone even though Ive disconnected them from the paired device and turned them off.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Very great fitting. Nothing can beat ir,Very comfortable. I would recommend this to every one especially people having small ears. Much better in terms of build quality and fitting then samsung earbuds.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-28,Great noise cancellation,Really like these earbuds but worry about the noise cancellation when walking outside. I usually just wear one when walking. The noise cancellation clearly works well. Definitely recommend.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-28,Could not get the buttons to work properly,"Update 4/8/2020: the company sent me a replacement( very quickly) and the buttons on the new ones are still working after 2 months. As for my other issues, sound and staying in place, the new ones did not correct those issues. I've had these earbuds for almost a month. While they still work, I still can not get the buttons on the earbuds to work properly per the manual. The buttons seem to have a random function built in, in that if I push the right earbud three times I can get the device to turn off, pause, do nothing, or sometimes play the next song. I can get them to turn off easily enough. According to the manual, the volume can be changed but I can't get these to perform this function. The sound is okay, but not like my other earbuds from different manufacturers. I would never use these to workout in because they easily fall out. Several times while sitting in my chair and turning my head, one earbud would fall out. Yes they are firmly in place. I constantly have to keep making sure they are firmly in place. At times, I'll even hold my hands to my ears if I have to move. Outside walking, earNOfun trying to play hide and seek when they fall out, so I don't use them outside any longer. Thinking about using a headband with them. Bottom line..... the buttons are broken !! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-28,You have to try!!!,The best sound quality ever! And the battery far surpasses all the ear buds I've tried.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-28,Definitely worth the purchase,Sound great and fit perfect. Great headphones for work.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-28,"good for listening, not for talking on the phone","These hold a good charge and are easy to use. The sound is very good. Do not expect to have a phone conversation using them, however. The person you are talking to will complain right away."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,Amazing quality for the price!,"These sound absolutely fantastic. I was honestly hesitant because of how cheap they are, but I am so impressed. They look and feel good, too. And the case has wireless charging so I can charge the buds in the case while I charge the case on my phone! These have instantly become my favorite earbuds I've ever had."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,Can't beat these buds,"For the price, these are the best you can get. I can't believe how solid these are, great sound and battery life. Besides, you can get many pairs of these for the price of one pair of some!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-29,Love the product,"Sound level to low, to big for my lil ears. But love the look and quality. Thx"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,Perfect pair if you have wireless charging,"I love these earbuds because they are perfect for my lifestyle. I keep these in my Tesla, which has a wireless charging pad. I can charge these directly in the car, and keep them there for when I go on walks or go to the gym. THe sound quality is pristine. It pairs with BT 5.0 which means it is fast, and the gestures mean I never have to take my phone out. I'm in love with this pair! The only very very minor complaint is that if I put my phone in my back pocket, sometimes the earbuds will skip. I suspect this is because of the BT radios in the earbuds due to their small physical size. Either way it doesn't happen enough for me to majorly ding a star off. The rest of it is still amazing!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,Worth the money,"Not expensive, good value for money"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,Fabulous Earbuds,"Earbuds are amazing, waterproof, comfortable and noise canceling."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,"Good sound, endless power.","I think quality of the earfun is very good considering the price. Sound quality, battery life is awesome. You won’t be out of power. It is a little big for my ears but I still will keep it."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-29,Decent buds,"Sound quality is good, excellent for bass, but not too overpowering. I go about a week in between having to charge the case, mostly using it in frequently at work and on my commute. Only real issue I have is poor connectivity for some reason only when I'm in the gym, signal keeps popping in and out from the left ear bud, even after i tried re-pairing the earbuds. Fit is also good, but the buds themselves are slightly big, compared to my previous Jabra 65t's."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,"They are great for at work, you can work an not miss your important calls",I Love You
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-30,"Good, but not for calls","I bought this to avoid spending 150+ on high-end brands, and this is a product with good design, looks sleek, easy to use....but people will hear you as if you were far far away, have tested on calls couple of times and had to go back to the wired ones. So keep this in mind, if you need it for calls (which I did) might not be the best idea ."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-30,Solid Product,For the price point on these headphones the sound quality and noise cancellation is excellent. My only complaint is the fit. I really only wear headphones in the gym and after having these in for an hour and a half my ears were slightly sore but I have had that problem before so it might be a personal problem. Would definitely recommend this product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,I use these every day,"These are great for the price and really are water proof! The connection distance is significantly further than past earbuds I've used. I'm worried that the case might break though 😬 bc the lid is kind of flimsy. But it hasn't happened yet, and everything else is really great."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,great product,fast shipping great product
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,Updating review,"I bought it to use it with my OnePlus 6T. Everything is great except I cannot have a conversation using these earbuds. The other person have hard time hearing me. Other than that battery life and sound quality is good. I just wish it was good for calls too. I heard it on review that it is great for calling as well, but I have yet to find that true. Call works fine too. Maybe I had bad signals when I tried earlier."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,Love ot,Great product... It won’t fall off
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,Best for me,Best for me
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-30,Decent,"As described, good purchase for the money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,Works great!,"Not the BEST listening devices I have ever heard, but they are definitely Good Enough for the music I listen to. Passive noise ""cancellation"" is adequate also for my environment. Battery life is really good. And I really like the charging case. It makes storage and charging easy, not to mention that it simplifies putting each earbud in the correct ear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,Best earbuds for a great price,Love the wireless and type c charging. Case is great. Have bought again!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-31,Wireless,"Got these for my girl cause she is into wireless headphones and listening to music all the time, she loves them and the wireless charging is a big plus"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-31,Excellent Wireless Earbuds with waterproof features at an affordable price,"EarFun Free is an excellent, well-made bluetooth wireless earbuds at an affordable price. First of all, It came in a well packaged box and also arrived on time. It also paired up pretty quickly once I started to turn on the device. The earbud itself is a great fit for my ears, and it’s quite comfortable to wear even when I use it for my indoor cycling and strength training in my home gym. It did not fall out of my ears while I am doing my reps because it is well secured and snuggly fit. I love to use it while working out because of its water proof features. I also wear it while I am taking showers. I have other expensive wireless earbuds but I don’t use it for working out because they don’t have water proof features. I also use it to listen to music while i lie down in my bed with my head on the side of my pillow. Indeed, I can wear it for several hours without experiencing ear pain or discomfort. The battery last very long which is approximately 6 hours per charge and the charging case gives me another 24 extra hours. This really great. What’s great about this charging case is it is a two way charge. It basically means that it can be charged using the USB-C, which is included in the box, and also can be charged via a Wireless charger (not included). The overall sound quality exceeds my expectations. The sound quality is great and perfect for my taste. The voice quality is great and I enjoy using it while I talk with my wife on the phone. It is well worth it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-31,Must get these!,"I love these earbuds there awesome great quality, crisp sound haven't really had a chance to test the battery life great so far"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-31,GREAT headphones!,"I am very impressed with these headphones, particularly at this price. I purchased them to replace some Airpods I put through the wash. I wish I had purchased these first. They have all the functionality of Airpods, plus several features Airpods do not compete with. Bluetooth 5.0 is a plus, as is the water resistance. They work great with the charging case, snapping in firmly when putting them back in the case. The battery life seems amazing so far. I have been using them this week in the gym for about an hour a session, and haven't needed to charge them yet. That is very impressive and much better than Airpods. I don't typically like having in ear phones which have the rubber tips, but these come with several sizes to find the right fit. The sounds quality is excellent and they are comfortable. I would definitely buy these again, and at 50 bucks, they're a steal."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-31,Wireless charging case and good sound quality,"Impressed with these earbuds. You can simply put the case on wireless charger and it starts charging, no cables needed. I liked this feature the best. Used it with my iPhone, could connect with Siri from a distance. So far listened to some pop music, sound quality and bass is quite good. Also comes with extra different size eartips. Overall I liked it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-31,Good buds..,I have gone through many wireless earbuds that were cheaper... so far so good. Only charged once since getting them weeks ago. You can charge them in the case either wireless or connected by wire. Very comfortable also.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-31,"Great, for a short while","These were fantastic for about 2 months. Unfortunately, they no longer hold a charge"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-01,Only 1 works after using.,After 60 days one of the earbuds stopped working. Can’t figure out why.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-01,Perfect combination of sound quality and aesthetic look for this price,"Looks and fits perfect in the ear. Never gets out of ear during running, excersice and physical activities. Noise cancellation is awesome and impressive for this price. Battery life, sound quality and Bluetooth compitancy are excellent as well. Overall I would say perfect piece for given price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-01,Good Product,Great product for a great price! Only down side is the noise cancellation.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-01,Battery life and sound,"Worked great, easy to use"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-02,Great for the price with some compromises,"Advantages:
- Price
- Speed of charging
- Size and portability
- Magnetic case
- Speed of pairing/connecting
Disadvantages:
- Some connection issues: occasionally they won't transmit sound until I disconnect and reconnect them. Happens both with my PC and my Android. - Sound quality in phone calls is inferior compared to wired headset. It seems that the microphone is too sensitive. People keep complaining that they hear lots of ambient/street noises loudly. Perhaps the fact that the mic is not close the mouth brought the designers to make it too sensitive. - Insufficient selection of tips. Only three sizes in rubber. No foam."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-02,Great wireless earbuds you won't be disappointed,"I bought these to use at the gym, while doing a treadmill workout. They give great sound, tone quality is perfect. They stay snug in your ear, even with running. Glad I chose them from all others! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-02,Very Impressed!,"The sound is excellent and the buds fit securely and comfortably in my ears. I’ve worn them bike riding, jogging and dancing (just to see if they’d stay in when I jerked my head around) and they have always remained securely in place. Pairing is a breeze and the charging case lasts for weeks, which is convenient for on the go hassle-free charging. The sound blocking is also very good. Perhaps too good. I can barely hear any outside noises when using them. I feel safer and more aware of my environment when wearing only one when out in public walking, biking or jogging."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-02,Satisfied,No comments
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-02,Excellent set of ear buds - at any price.,"I have just ventured into the truly wireless game and have purchased a few sets of earbuds in the past month. I sent them all (three) back. One had serious latency problems, one had terrible sound, and one had pairing issues (that one was a $100 pair). I read the Gamesky review of the Earfun Free (even though they are not ""free"") and figured I would take a chance. After all, Amazon's return policy is so good that I wasn't taking that much of a risk. Good choice! The Earfun Free TWS buds paired on my iphone 7 right away. Then no problem pairing with my ipad. So they passed that test. I'm not an expert at sound but I do appreciate several genres of music, from classical to jazz to old rock n roll. I tell you, the sound on these is excellent, as good as on my Bose noise cancelling on-ear headphones and about as good as my Bluedios. Maybe not as loud and as bass thumping as the Bluedios but more than adequate. So they passed that test. I used them on a treadmill today and no problem with the fi or comfort..
Then the latency test - with Amazon Prime and Netflix - no noticeable lag PAssed with flying colors..
For the price - about $50 - an excellent buy. I imagine I could find better sound at a higher price but I am completely happy with these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-02,Excellent quality at great price,Very nice design. Fit snuggly in ear with no discomfort. Long life change with visible lights to let you know when case needs charging. A very nice product.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-02,"Nice ear buds, but need more volume.","I had to install a sound boost system to get the volume high enough to hear it over normal noise. It really should have better sound quality. Other than that I like them. Comfortable in the ears, long battery life, and no cracked like my last set from competitor."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,Excellent sound an battery life,The sound quality and battery life of these headphones have beaten any others that I’ve tried.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,Wonderful battery life.,Love the 6 hour music play time. I can use the right earbud by itself.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-03,Walk Softly,"The buds are comfortable and almost not noticeable when in place (except for the sound). Charges last for the hour that I do yard work but I have yet to leave them in any longer than that. The sound is good, especially for the price. Bass is weak but not totally absent. Mids seem blurry and yet I've heard lyrics to some songs that I couldn't with other wired buds. Only thing that is a bit bothersome is the ""muffled bump"" I hear as my heal hits the ground when walking. Noise canceling is almost complete so be careful, I haven't had one drop out yet, they fit well. Update February 2020: I tried using these when bicycling, the ""muffled bump"" is so bothersome. I use only the right one so I can hear anything passing me on the left. Also I have an app that gives audio feedback on my ride so the ear pod is very useful but still quite hard to hear."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-03,Great value,The sound could be louder but it may just be me
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,Excellent earbuds,"Great battery life, excellent sound, very good noise cancellation. They paired very easily with my phone. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,Excellent quality,"You simply cannot beat the quality for this price. The earbuds are comfortable and do not fall off the ears. Perfect for the gym, walking, tv, or at work. The battery charge is excellent too! 5+ hours!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,Among the best,All wireless earbuds are overpriced. These less so than others and IMHO among the best.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,Excellent sound quality for the price,"I bought these earbuds to replace a set that I bought from another manufacturer and immediately returned due to poor sound quality. The Earfun buds arrived well packaged. I plugged them into USB-C (huge benefit by the way since all new Android phones use USB-C) and let them charge up. The charging case is solid and seems to operate well. The earbuds are a little slippery so getting them out of the charging wells took a little effort the first time but once I figured out where to grasp them it was smooth. I changed out the eartips for the larger size supplied and paired them to the phone with ease. I placed them in my ears and fired up my music app, almost holding my breath after my previous bad experience with the other manufacturer, and was very pleasantly surprised. The Earfun earbuds have very good sound. The bass is definitely there, and has a nice punch too it without being muddy or overwhelming. The mids and highs were clean and crisp without the screech that some other earbuds have. The fit was good and comfortable. Battery life so far seems good. I haven't tested the wireless charging capability of the case so not sure how that works yet, but wired charging is always faster anyway. I was a little concerned at first that these earbuds use a tactile button to control functions rather than touch taps, but after using them a bit I find that I actually prefer that since it eliminates inadvertent touches. Also, contrary to what I have seen in some reviews of these earbuds, there is volume control in the buds, not need to use your phone. All in all very pleased so far and would recommend to anyone looking for tws earbuds in this price range."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-03,For this price is a steal,"This are great for the price that's it your getting what you pay for basically.. but honestly you get more for this ones the sound its great, buttery life good , and they look very expensive and high quality. The only bad thing is i feel that they are real bulky compare to others in the market. They seem small but in my opinion they are big but not heavy at all . The buttons are a little bit harsh to use specially inside your ear you have to push firm and that gets uncomfortable when using them in your ear besides that yes I recommend this earbuds like I said for the price are well worth it"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-04,An expensive paperweight,Won’t stay connected to my iPhone X costly hear that voice in my ear trying to connect connect trying to connect piece of junk
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-04,SOUNDS GOOD FOR MY S10 NOTE PLUS,Just received these today.. Ive been utubing on how they work since these are my 1st ear buds and i have to say they sound nice on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. I can charge these behind my phone VIA WIRELESS CHARGING that the NOTE 10 PLUS HAS SOO THATS A BIG PLUS [WIRELESS POWER SHARE].. YOU CAN ALSO CHARGE THESE ON WIRELESS CHARGING PAD. The bass is pretty good i mean i can't compare since I've never tried ear buds before. But iam a simple person and these kick ass to me ... And since they are the updated version even better.. Why pay more money for Galaxy ear buds and these are probably the same.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-04,Work great!,I got them for my husband for Christmas and he loves the sound quality.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-04,Great Earbuds at a Great Price,Really nice wireless earbuds at a great price. Very happy with them.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-04,Had to put 1 in rice,"So, let me say that I love these earbuds, but they had me worried. One of them dropped in the shower and didn't work right until I left it over night in a bag of rice (I have a special bag of rice for just this reason). It wasn't the fall, it was the water. These are supposed to be able to withstand swimming, and the shower is clearly not a swimming environment. I think if you are going to look for reliable waterproof earbuds, you may wish to look elsewhere. But I want to stress, I really like these earbuds, so I dont want to be too harsh.... happy listening!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-04,Good bang for your buck wireless earplugs,"In the overall realm of wireless earbuds, these may not be able to match up with the best of the best, but for the money, they represent a great piece of tech. Sound is not punchy, but it's good enough. Set up is super easy, bluetooth connection has never failed me. Battery life is good. A little awkward getting the buds out of their charging case, but that's a minor issue. I use these nearly every day and love them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-04,Great for the price,These ear buds are just what I needed. They shipped and arrived super fast with a full battery charge so I could use them right away. They are really easy to pair to all my electronics that I use. The voice assistant works but you need to make sure you read the instructions on how to use all the features since there is only one button on each ear piece. I will definitely buy them again.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-04,Terrible for phone calls.,"Sound quality while listening to music was great. They are absolutely useless for phone calls though, which is primarily why I bought them. Any time I call someone, they tell me I’m constantly cutting out. Pretty disappointed with that aspect."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-04,Read before buying,"Awesome earbubs. Finally an ear bud that has everything. -Compact design
-usb c
-small case
-tactile button
The only thing I could find wrong was that it didn't show the battery meter on the phone for the buds. Also I feel like one side is louder than the other. Also 1 click, play. 2 click skip. 3 click volume. I wish volume was hold down
Overall I've been using them for a week at the gym and haven't charged them yet"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-04,Good sound quality,I like these ear buds. Good sound and people can understand me. Not the best at staying in my ear but that might just be me.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,Ear fun,Excellent quality earphone...
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,A beast with all features you would love to have,"I have tried many Bluetooth headsets in the past. I can clearly say that this headset clearly stands out as the best. Here's why:
1. The headsets in the market try to offer you good quality sound, however this is by far provides the best quality sound, including low frequency base. 2. Many headsets have not evolved with the current situation in the market, stuck with age-old micro USB, thanks to Ear Fun, you get industry standard USB C port. 3. Just try to search for a Bluetooth headset with a wireless charger option, I'm sure you end up spending a fortune, or there are higher chances that you would compromise on the sound quality, with Ear Fun, you get wireless charging option with zero compromise on the sound quality, at a very competitive price. So, I would say, you can buy this headset blindfolded."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,The sound is amazing,The headphones have great sound effects，a durable battery that lasts more than 25 hours on a full charge，and are waterproof 。It’s a great product。
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,Definitely worth the money,I started using these earpieces every day at work and they are mighty nice though as to be expected they are not for continuous use for many many hours because you do have to charge them but if you have time to charge them for 10 minutes in between intervals then they're perfectly good.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-05,The sound quality was excellent.,Fit my ears really well and did not fall out. Loved the nude color and the sound was excellent.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-05,"Great audio, badly shaped design.","The audio is great and the battery lasts a long time, but the body of the earbuds is so short that if you get too sweaty while working out they'll just fall out."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,The best earphones I ever had,"Since I buy headphones this is the best deal I ever made for many years! looks and feel great. Sounds really good. Battery is perfect and so far for everything I did with it was perfect (working, talking , biking and traveling). My only concern would be maybe the charging case who does not feel very sturdy but that something I'll see in the future."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,"Great value, would buy again.","Have been using these buds for a few months with iPads and iPhones. Excellent balanced sound, tight bass, and great human phone sound. A little tricky taking the buds from the case (nothing major). Great value!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,"I've never liked earbuds, but I love these",Connects easily. Holds charge well and are comfortable to wear
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-05,Wireless earbuds changed my life,"I didn't realize how hard a time I was having with corded headphones (having to take them off to get out of my coat or pullovers, needing pockets to listen, general awkwardness), but now I can't go back. The sound of these is excellent - not too heavy on the bass, and no shrill tones. They aren't the epitome of noise cancelling, but they get me through crowded streets just fine. I had an issue of them falling out of my ears no matter what size caps I used (usually I use the medium one), but the TRICK is to angle them back a little. Perhaps that's how everyone else has been doing, but I went from them dropping to the floor when I took off my hat or hood to totally snug. I did have the left bud dying issue, but the vendor was more than hospitable and replaced the whole set quickly."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-06,Not what you want,Subpar. Returned immediately
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-06,Ear Buds,"I thought that the sound quality was very good. It fits in my ear perfectly and does not easily fall off. Overall, good quality product that’s a good value as well."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-06,Decent sound quality; sub-par microphone for voice calls,"Overall I have mixed feeling for my headphone. I was very hopefully for these earbuds and I have been impressed with the sound quality and the battery life. However my primary need is to be able to use this for voice call and hands free conference calls. There is no effective noise reduction on the microphone and I am consistently a distraction in any meeting where I attempt to use them to talk. I would return these but waited too long. SO for now, they are great for listing to music but not much else. The only other item i'm mixed on is the noise cancellation. I think thy are working as advertised however they give me the feeling of being underwater while out in the world. Once the sound is engaged this is not a problem however you can't walk around with these in your ear as you are virtually deaf till they are removed."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-06,So far so good.,"So far so good. I've had them for 2 days now. It's taking some time for my ears to adjust to the fit, but it's getting better."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-06,Great value,Love these! Great $ value
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Sound,Battery last for hrs. The sound is a good quality. They fit perfect. I was able to connected to my iPhone with no trouble. Money’s worth.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Why pay more when you can get the same premium experience at a fraction of the price,"Why pay more when you can get the same premium experience at a fraction of the price. I'm not by any means an avid product reviewer, although I shop here at Amazon quite often, and let me tell you, If you are here looking for a premium, exceptionally functional pair of ear buds but in acquiring it you don't want to break the bank, then my fellow reader, this is it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Best bang for the buck,I work outdoors a lot. They block out a lot of sound. I have to pause my music just to somewhat hear people. The mic is not the best for a noisy workplace. To be fair I work at an airport near the tarmac. One charge usually lasts almost my whole shift. They have no problem syncing to my phone. They stay in my ear.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-07,Solid performance for the price,"Had these buds for about a month. Very satisfied with purchase. Sound is good. Battery life could be better. Occasional issues with Bluetooth sync and sound changes while listening, but solved when re-pairing. Even wore them in shower once with no issues. For price I paid, I would recommend them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Excellent Earbuds,"I was honestly kind of skeptical about buying these headphones. After a few weeks of having it on my list I decided to buy them. The battery last a long time. I was at the library for at least 6 hours, doing homework and listening to music. They still had 50% left before putting them back in their case. The quality of the audio is great, and the noise cancelation. I really recommend these headphones. I do not regret getting these instead of the Samsung ones at all."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-07,Sound is great! Battery life awesome,These sound great and last all day! My only complaint is during a long sweaty work out the start to fall ot my ear. I would but again
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Great earbuds!,Good purchase experience.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Amazing,"I love this head phones. I spend hundred of dollars buying cheap quality headphone and never last a week. These are great quality, battery life absolutely fantastic."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Great quality!,"These are really cool, so glad I bought them! Sound is good, they are a comfortable fit, and the case charges them multiple times. Compared to other prices I'm very pleased overall."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-07,Fantastic budget earbuds,"These are fantastic budget earbuds. They have nice, clear sound, good range, and great battery life. They're easy to pair and set up, and work like a charm. I heavily recommend these earbuds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-08,QI wireless,QI wireless and less than $50!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,"Great sound, great price.","Easy set up, good sound, great price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,Outstanding sound!,"I already own a pair of EarFun bluetooth speakers, so I decided to check the earbuds. I've tried a bunch of different earbuds, and any of them had even close to these with sound quality. EarFun earbuds really have decent but clear bass. Also I like physical buttons, so when I accidentally touch the bud, nothing wrong happens! Great company and great products!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,Awesome item,So I’ve tried several pairs of the style of headphones and they all work great I work retail and it’s hard for me to work without music it stays in my ear very well and isn’t visible through my hair it is a bit foggy or than other parents I’ve tried but they sound amazing staying that you’re well and still aren’t noticeable it last about six hours per earbud per charge and I want of how you can use each one independently definitely recommend this product
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-08,Don't get this unless you like to replace buds,"Too easy to lose, they don't stay in well if you're sweating. I lost 1 bud within 2 weeks of purchase"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-08,The music sound quality is...meh.,"I was looking for a pair of decent, sub-$100 wireless earbuds, so I tried these EarFuns because of the high praise they received from several publications. I am not an audiophile by any means, but the music sound quality was flat and uninspiring. It wasn't tinny like many of the wireless earbuds, just...meh. I have tried 8 different budget wireless earbuds. I think many people rave about the sound quality of their earbuds as soon as they get them, without comparing them to others. I tried the buds one after the other. The best by far was the 1MORE Stylish, which is normally $100, but was on sale for $59. It has a rich sound, clear highs and mids, and decent (but not overpowering) bass."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-08,Not bad,Great customer service.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,Great,Better than raycons! Worth the money!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,Perfection!,"Big companies have to learn from these guys here! Outstanding! Improving a little bit the sound quality, and in my opinion, they won't have competition at all!!! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,Worth for you money!!,"Nicely fits to my ears. I tried to shake and also used on treadmill and it didn't fell off. Great sound quality, noise cancellation and great battery life."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-09,Buyer BeWare!,I was fooled by the great reviews. These buds sounded like 99cent store bought items. So cheap! Do not buy....
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Love them,"Like everything about them
They work great and battery life lasts great"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Incredible!,"I wasn't expecting great performance from them to be honest. I was hoping for 'good enough' to work out with. They've exceeded my expectations though! They fit in my ear, and stay snug while working out. The battery life is pretty close to advertised too! 4 hours per charge, I'd say is really close. The sound quality, when in the ear correctly, really is pretty incredible! I have a pair of 'Advanced Model 3 in ear monitors', and I've never heard music like that, every song felt like I was listening to it for the first time! These EarFun Free earbuds come close enough to that quality that I don't use the Model 3's anymore. Being truly wireless, with the recharging case make them very convenient! I would definitely recommend!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-09,Easy to set up,Easy to use and set up. Very good sound quality.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Wireless Earbuds,"The case is very sleek, and functions as a portable earbuds charger and battery bank for your phone! The earbuds are very comfortable and easy to command, just tap to pause and tap again to play. The design is very sleek and modern, I highly recommend this!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-09,Solid.,Solid ear buds. The sound quality is what you’d expect for $50. Microphone is not good at all for taking calls. Battery is decent.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-09,Great at damn near everything except volume.,I didn’t have yes very long at all. The fit was amazing. Noise cancellation perfect! The only thing was and I returned them because of low volume. Like easily half of any others I’ve tried. Great product otherwise and would try the next generation too see if they’ve increased the volume.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Good value,Good value and sound quality. Wireless charging is a nice feature too.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Comparable to Samsung earbuds,I have an Apple AirPod so I can only compare it to that. I really think these are so good for the money I paid. It looks more like Samsung earbuds. It comes in a great packaging for gifting. I’d definitely buy it if you’re trying to save money and looking for alternatives
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-09,Great headphones!,Awesome sound quality.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-09,Wireless Earbuds,The product is overrated. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Unmatched for the price,"For the money I believe these are unmatched. If you're not using them for their water proof feature then I believe there are better earbuds because the sound quality on these are the only major thing I can critique. But in the world if ""you getting what you pay for"" you're getting allot for what you're paying."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-09,Good sounds at a good price,"Good sound at a good price purchased for my daughter and she can’t take them out of her ears. Noise cancellation is enhanced with some Comply foam inserts, otherwise it’s just ok. Looking at getting a pair for myself. **UPDATE**
Got my own pair. I love these. I drive for a package carrier so I can’t wear both at the same time plugging both ears. I was concerned, having read questions and answers, that I wouldn’t be able to listen to only one while the other was charging in the case. Maybe I got a different version of the headset but contrary to all the answers I read, I can alternate using the left with the right charging in the case or use the right with the left charging in the case with no problem. I’ve walked up to 50 yards from the truck with one in my ear and the other in the truck without interruption. I can take calls, with either one also. So, I couldn’t be happier with this little miracle! I can work my entire shift listening to music, audio books or podcasts to my little heart’s content and all I have to do is switch the buds after 5 hours or so. That’s not to say that’s all the battery lasts, tho. I haven’t had them drain all the way yet."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-10,Sound is great!!,This EarFun Free earbuds sound is very good and connects easily upon selecting in your settings. The charge box is small and compact and easy to carry in your purse or pocket. It also stays charged for a long time!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-10,Comfortable and Long Battery Life Earbuds,"I have used these earbuds for about a month now and find them very comfortable, cancel outside noise Ok, not great, and the batteries last a very long time. The case provides the extra charge so I can spend an entire evening listening without worrying about have enough charge to last. Sound quality is good, separates tenor and base well, very good with voices if you use them to stream a video. I would recommend these earbuds. Good price also."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-10,Value,Great for the price
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-10,Great product..,Great headphones for the price.. clear and great sound.. Great for the price..
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-10,Not bad.,Music quality is good and the design is a bit bigger than some of the other earbuds I've seen. Unfortunately no one can hear me during phone calls. Unless I cupped my hands slightly over the earbuds and talked loudly. It was very difficult for the other person to hear me otherwise. The battery life is not bad from what I've experienced. Maybe it was defective and a one off. For $50 it's not bad and will certainly do the job for someone not looking to break the bank.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-10,Broken in a month,Earbuds are great but a month after I got them the right side speaker broke and I don’t know how it happened. Other then that good product.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-10,They were good for 3 weeks,Stopped charging after 3 weeks of minimal use.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-10,Wonderfully clear sound,"I have purchased a couple of sets like these, all to have one earbud crap out on me less than 6 months in. What caught my eye about these is that the case is QI wireless charging compatible- YES!! I purchased a wireless charging pad a few months back and have been searching for earbuds that would work too. I love these cases; they’re super easy to store away either in your back pocket, purse, gym bag, backpack, cr console or glove box- really anywhere. So far the sound is very clear- and they have terrific sound quality. They even have built-in MEMS microphones with noise cancellation for you to enjoy clear hands-free calls and voice assistance. Dbl bonus. As with most earbuds, they have additional ear-tips in various sizes to fit the comfort of the consumer. These are made very well, and the case is not a plastic cheapo. The battery does last awhile per charge. I use these for work now."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-10,Pretty good for the cost,Stayed in pretty well. Blocked noise pretty well. Sounded pretty good.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-10,Bulky,Love everything about these but they are bulky af other than that they are amazing for the price .
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-11,Not good for calls but good for running under the rain.,The buds work. But I had to modify Tempe equalizer to get bass in music. Also when I’m on the phone callers hear a lot of static and noise around me if I’m not in an absolutely silent place. They are good for running though.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,Worth every penny,Great ear buds for a great price
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,What’s not to love?,"I have been thrilled with this purchase. I got these earbuds at an excellent price and have not been disappointed in their performance. They hold a charge on standby for weeks. When in use, the charge lasts over half of my work day. The cool thing is, I can use just one while the other is charging, so I never have to worry about not having battery life. Also, I love that the case can charge on my phone’s wireless charger."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,So worth the money,Great Earbuds. My husband uses them while driving (just one) and loves them. Amazing sound quality. Wish I could give them more stars.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,They Hold up well.,Bought these for my son. He wears them every day and they hold up well. Must be very noise cancelling...he can’t hear me when I talk to him. I have to get his attention before he acknowledges I need to speak to him.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,My first Bluetooth Earbuds,"I can't compare these to anything else as I've never owned a pair of bluetooth earbuds before. I have been using them for working around the shop and outside when working. I mostly listen to audiobooks, and spoken text like talk radio mostly. Some Music. They work great for me. The freedom to work without catching a cord is wonderful. The sound quality is fine for what I do. Music sounds good to me but it's not up to some earphones I've used. I had some issues with loosing the bluetooth signal on an old ( I mean old) android phone I own but anything else I've used has been rock solid. I've seen some reviews were people mention this but I'm sure it's not the earbuds but the phone. I would buy them again. Very inexpensive."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-11,Amazing till it wasn't,The product is amazing at least it was for the first few weeks it worked perfectly however now one of the year buds is much quieter than the other and I can't get them to be at equal volume hopefully it gets fixed but for now it has to be a 2 star review.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-11,Volume is too low,Good product but it is too low of a sound. I can have all the volume up but it only sound as if it was half the volume. Good product otherwise.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,Works perfectly,Works more then what I expected . Thanks
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-12,"It was great, then it wasn’t.",I bought these originally last year and they worked really well. I primarily wanted them for talking on the phone with my hubby while making dinner. They were awesome. I could walk all over the house on a call without carrying my phone around. Then I did something stupid and washed them with the laundry. Of course they didn’t work anymore so I bought another pair. The second pair didn’t work as well with calls. My husband couldn’t hear me when I spoke. I thought maybe I just got a dud pair so I returned them and got another pair. But the third pair also doesn’t work well with calls. Hubby still can’t hear me when I speak. He says the sound cuts in and out. I’m very sad the other pairs didn’t work as well as the first. I’m sick of trying to get a pair that works so I think I will find another brand now.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-12,Easy to use,I'm quite happy with my new Wireless earbuds. The sound quality is great and the bass is good which was my biggest concern when searching for the best ones on Amazon. I'm glad a lot of reviewers mentioned about the bass quality.Then again without having the cord is wonderful and an excellent trade off. Longer will I have to struggle with the cord getting caught on the workout.This being my first time with a wireless earbuds I have to say i'm pretty pleased with everything so far. I would recommend this as it is a reasonable price for what it is.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-12,Amazing,Only problem I have with these is it hard to hear even with the sound off.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,good earbuds,"really a good product, my friend loved it"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,Great product for the price! Some issues,I love the sound and the way they seal your ear. Bass is very decent but lack a bit in power. The waterproofing is iffy. Sweatpoir yes but it will power off if water touches the contacts. Which doesn't make sense considering they show someone swimming in a pool.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,Just plain great on every level,"Bought these and another brand that looked similar. Kept these, sent the others back. Superior sound quality, great noise canceling, fit and stay in my ears, and the battery life is amazing."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,They are comfortable and sound great,They are comfortable and sound great
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-13,Does not charge,They would not charge in the charging station. I only got to use them once. Horrible quality.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,I got them by mistake but a happy mistake,I was supposed to get something else but I'm happy with the buy lol nice sound I wish they sound louder but it's okay
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-13,Won't last long,"They just broke after 5 months of use. The case won't take a charge anymore. I expect a pair at this price to last at least 2 years. These ones were also slippery when getting them out of the case, I dropped the earbuds several times. To their credit, they never broke from the drops. My new earbuds have a matte finish which helps a surprising amount when grabbing them out of the case."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-13,"Doesn't work for running, falls out of ears, doesn't fit properly.","Doesn't work for running, falls out of ears, doesn't fit properly."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-13,Not worth it!,The right ear bud stop working in less than one month.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,Best Gift Ever,"I purchased this for my son. He LOVES them! They work well, hold a good charge and are a good fit into the ear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,Excellent and affordable!,Great quality and easy to use. Very pleased with all aspects for a reasonable price! Highly recommend!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,That they are good headphones,I love theses headphones they are best set I have bought battery life is perfect with them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-14,Easy to use,"The sound quality is comparable to my jaybird headphones , sounds crispy"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-14,It does not function very well,"The sound quality is moderately good, I must place the maximum volume and still it sounds very low, from time to time the sound is broken with small interruptions, and finally when I am on a call the other person does not listen to me well, they say that it is heard choppy."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-14,Well worth the money,"They're good and they work as advertised. I did have an issue once where the left earbuds was connected but wasn't playing sound but putting it in the case and reconnecting automatically solve the issue. Overall, I'd say that they're well worth it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-14,Great price,Great price good quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-14,Would buy again,"Love these earbuds. Great sound, long battery life, what seems like 5-6 hours of continuous use, not even counting the case. They never feel loose in my ear. No issues connecting. Glad I purchased them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-14,The clarity of sound,These earbud are GREAT. The sound is clear and the noise cancellation is be good. This was an excellent purchase.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-15,Awesome for the$$$,These earbuds sound excellent considering they are only $49.99 So far so good . No complaints
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-15,SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED,"1) You'll need a magnifying glass to read the cryptic operating manual. And it barely touches on charging issues. Why is this such a common issue with budget electronics??!!! It's not difficult to give detailed info and print it in in a BLACK, legible font. 2) The red lights flash even when the Earbuds should be fully charged. I BELIEVE this should not be happening, but there's no way to know for sure given the sketchy operating manual. 3) On phone calls I've been told I sound a bit ""robotic"" and the sound cuts off at times. 4) The earbuds are big and somewhat clunky. I expected them to be about 30% smaller. 5) Music playback is decent but bass lacks some depth and treble is a bit too crisp. Due to the size of the earbuds, i need to constantly push them into my ears to get a better seal and best sound. I can't imagine exercising in them, but they're ok if i'm sitting still or doing housework."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-15,Great budget wireless earbuds,Setup: The earbuds paired with my Android phone just by pulling them from the box. Exactly like setup should be. Fit: The ear tips that were on it seemed fine so I don't know about swapping them out. Running with them seems okay so far although I did have one fall out (might have not been pushed in all the way) too soon. Sound: I listen to mostly podcasts so my review is probably not worth much on this area. Battery life: I use them mostly an hour at a time and it doesn't seem like I put a dent in the battery at all. Excellent product so far
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-15,Do not buy!,Received some used ones instead of new
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-15,Great product,These are really good for working out or if you don’t feel like untangling your earbuds I use these all the time great buy
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-16,Ehhhh it's ok,The earbuds are larger than expected. The sounds isnt nearly as loud as I would like it but over all an ok product.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-16,Don't waste your money on these headphones.,"They do not stay in ear. Fall out all the time:-(
They claim to be noise cancelling yet I can hear everything while wearing them. A waste of money. I missed the return date because of my cancer treatments or I would of returned for a refund."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-16,Absolutely wonderful,They are a little bulky
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-16,Decent for the money,Great quality for the money. Long time use hurts ears from shape. Stay in well while working out
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-16,Great sound,So far so good. The only challenge I have sometimes is they pop out my ears.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-16,Good - amazing battery life,"Edit: I just left these on overnight (after using them for a few hours) and when I woke up 12 hours later they were still on just fine and played audio when I tested. They weren't playing anything overnight, but they were on and connected to my phone, so the battery life on standby is pretty darn amazing. Have had it about a month - if anything battery life seems better than expected, but I do pause the music habit so it isn't continuous. Pretty good at blocking outside noise, as long as you turn volume up a little."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-16,Love these!,"I absolutely love these earbuds! These are my first pair of wireless earbuds and they work great. The battery lasts extremely long, they fit great in my small ear, and the sound quality is pretty good too! I don’t have one issue with these. Can’t beat it for the price!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-16,Good value,I love these for the most part! I wish war tip options had a little more cushion help with ear fatigue.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-17,Solid earbuds,No issues to report! Sound is clear and stands up well to the other ones I have. Design is pretty nice. Have not tested out the wireless charging feature.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-17,Actually sounds good for music and calls,Inexpensive and sounds very good. I run and am able to make phone calls without complaints from the other end. Buttons are not perfect at all but its so much cheaper than others and it works.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-17,Good earbuds,They stay in the ears during my workout. Sound quality and battery life are good. The only problem I have is related to the phone calls which quality could be better.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-17,Worth every penny,"It is well made and easy to use, but i had to return it coz i thought they were touch"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-17,Trash,No one could hear me when i used the ear pieces. I really tried to get it to work better but to no avail as a result my return window passed. Poor product...
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-17,Good quality sound.,Nice portable ear device. Good quality sound.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-18,Excellent Product but...,"Good sound quality. This headphone are waterproofed thus microphone is unusable unfortunately, you can't get a normal conversation."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,"These are killer, way better than I'd expect for the money","I like having an affordable pair of headphones for high risk situations, leaving (forgetting) at the office, etc. Although I have both the Sony WH-1000XM3s and WF-1000XM3s, I found myself wanting a wireless earbud equivalent to the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2s I leave at work. For further background, I have a range of other headphone at home like the Sennheiser HD650, Audio Technica ATH-AD900, and more... so while I go in to $50 headphones with tempered expectations I also don't want garbage. The Koss Porta Pros are also one of my most used models of headphone (I own several pairs), but they also punch above their weight. I tried the Anker SoundCore Life P2s and found it nearly impossible to get a consistent fit with them. I also find the long stalk style design they use to look a bit goofy, although that's far from a deal breaker. The inconsistent fit significantly affected my ability to get a proper seal and as a result affected whether there was any bass or overall balance to the sound from the Ankers. The buttons on the Ankers also required enough force and clicked noticeably enough that they were uncomfortable to operate. I did not want to spend big money trying different third party tips and I also don't want these to isolate or seal as well as the Sony WF-1000XM3s with Comply tips and ANC on, so I wasn't going to put Complys on them. After returning the Ankers I thought I'd give these Earfuns a try as they had very positive reviews overall. To say I've been impressed has been an understatement. I'd love to see a larger sized eartip included but the L size seems to be working for me. Fit is massively more consistent than with the Ankers and the sound quality as a result is consistent. These have a nice full sound with pleasantly extended and punchy bass, as well as even overall tonal response without harsh sibilance or other major issues. The charging case is simple but effective, and pretty compact. I've not tried the wireless charging capability but I have to admit that's a neat bonus. Battery life both of the case and the earbuds themselves has been quite good overall and the built in charge indicator for the case is a nice bonus over the Ankers. Like the Ankers (and unlike the Sonys), these can be listened to with just one earbud. They automatically switch to a mono mode (I tested to be sure) and have no problem swapping in and out of using one or two buds. They also work fine in the shower or rain so far. Another improvement over the Anker Life P2 is the button on each earbud seems to be a bit of a softer press. While it's still a physical button and not touch like on the Sonys, they're less unpleasant to operate than the Anker's buttons. Overall these are a no-brainer and I've been recommending them to friends in the market for something affordable. They're much better than they have any right to be. While I've had a couple hiccups with connectivity while I was testing things and trying to figure out how to pair to new devices, it's not really a major flaw or issue. These, like the Ankers, can only pair to one device at a time so you just have to be prepared to deal with manually repairing if you want to change what they're connected to."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,Great for the price!,"Does not have great bass, nor excellent sound quality. However, it’s a great product for the price. I run with them all the time. They fit snug in my ears. They come with different ear buds to fit your size inner ear. They play the music and connect to my phone easily. They have cool user controls to change volume, songs, or pause while running by pressing the bud a certain number of times. Great device for what you pay for!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,The best earbuds ever,One of the best earbuds I have received previously I have trided many earbuds but those were not good the skin quality was very bad. I ordered this after I checked the reviews and the reviews are trustworthy. The battery life is also very long. I am going to buy another pair for my brother.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,"This earfun is a ""must"" to have","That headphone is a ""must"" to have if you are music fan. The battery is so good, it holds the charge for than a week depending on how I use it. Good bass, clear sound. I have mine for almost 2 months and it's going strong like a rock. If you're not worried about Brand Name you won't regret spending your money on that. I definitely recommend it and I need two more. I love it."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-18,"Sounds good, couple glitches","I just received my earbuds this past weekend. I have come across a couple issues within the first hour of use, but it may be something dealing with depending on how much you are willing to spend on a pair of earbuds. 1) Though only a split second, the sound cut in and out three different times within an hour of use. The troubleshooting questions says if this happens to make sure I was close enough to my device and that there is nothing interfering with the signal, however, the phone was in my hand when this happened...that is the closest you can pretty much get to your phone without holding it to your ear, lol. Being that we live in a world full of wireless signals, I'm sure there is technology that can stay connected even with a little interference, my old Jaybirds did fine with connection, but they were more expensive. Also, I used them at work with my phone within arms reach and it did it three times already in the past hour again when first turning them on. 2) I was excited to learn that I wouldn't have to connect or disconnect my earbuds when taking them in and out of the charging case, it should connect/disconnect automatically. However, when I put the earbuds in the charging case and put them up I later started noticing that my phones sound wasn't working...only to figure out it was still connected via Bluetooth to the earbuds while in the charger. I tried to take the earbuds out of the case and manually turn them off using the button before putting them back in the charger, but it still reconnected to my phone after doing so. The only way to get them to disconnect was to turn off my Bluetooth. The instructions say if my Bluetooth is turned off the earbuds will turn off after 10 minutes, I did so and this worked...but I don't want to have to turn my Bluetooth on and off, I use this function frequently with other speakers, including my car stereo and car insurance beacon in my car, so I can't have it turned off when traveling. This is a hassle. **Please read the update below, this issue did resolve itself**
The earbuds sound is nice, they are noise cancelling to a point, light and fit nicely in my ear with no movement when shaking my head. I don't really use them for calling, so I have not tested this feature. I also really like the magnetic case that helps hold the earbuds in place and the light indicator on the front of the box that tells me the chargers battery life when I open and close the lid. All very simple, inexpensive, doesn't really impress, but doesn't really let me down - earbuds. I emailed the seller to see if they suggest anything for my 2 issues above, I will post an update if they are able to assist me. **UPDATE 2.19.19**
I have continued using the earbuds while waiting on a response to continue testing. It seems that the connect/disconnect feature has started working for me now, I'm not sure what caused the issue the first time, but hopefully it was just an initial startup issue. If you have this problem, you might give it time and try again later. The sellers have responded quickly and gave me a couple tips. They suggested some steps to clean the connection between the charger and the earbuds or to try to reset the bluetooth connection. Since this issue has been resolved, I did not feel the need to do that at this time, but will keep it in mind if it happens again. I increased the stars to 4 since this corrected itself and for the response from the seller. The intermittent cutting out, though minimal and slightly noticeable, still happens. But I also noticed that it seems to happen when I first start using them and after 30-45 minutes it either stops or doesn't happen to where I notice it anymore. The seller did think this was a ""network environment and interception of outer environment"" issue, not the phone or the product. And while that may be the case, I'm not sure there is anyway I can fix my environment, at home or at work, lol. I have never had bluetooth earbuds like these, so I can't compare it to a more expensive brand. I would hope if this was $100+ product, this issue would not happen, but who knows...The seller did say that it is possible this issue will fix itself overtime and to give them some time to work normally. Whether that is true or not, I'm willing to keep the earbuds and deal with a little beginning connection issue, for the most part it has not hindered my listening enough to go through the hassle of returning them, just to continue my search and try another cheap brand. In all honesty, I'm just cheap and don't want to pay much more than this on a pair of earbuds, lol. I have not tried ones under this $50 range, so you might even try one of those first if you aren't too picky and don't mind the hassle of returning a product through Amazon. I appreciate the sellers quick response and willingness to help resolve the issue. Good luck!"

Not one to blast my music so I like the fact they still provide decent noise canceling even when not up loud. I would definitely recommend this product."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,Great sound.,Great earbuds. Very satisfied. The bass is great. Very durable.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-18,Great buy,Great sound and long lasting battery life
EarFun,Free,4,0,2020-02-18,"Great sound, great price.","I was fortunate to get the Oluv editions of these while they were available. They sounded fantastic. Not quite a year later my right ear stopped producing sound, but otherwise still worked fine. It controlled the player, the left side paired, etc.
I contacted Earfun and they were very helpful and replaced them free of charge. Sad to say the replacements were not of Oluv quality. Though they sound ok, the Oluvs were fantastic. They say they cannot transfer the eq settings over to the standard ones. Maybe oluvs settings what made them sound so good was more than an eq tweak. Anyways, even though these replacements were not the Oluv ones, they still sound ok. A little bright sounding. Lows are not a pronounced. Still sound decent though. Seems they made some changes too. The left ear can now pair to the phone independent of the right ear. This was one of my gripes from the Oluv version. So that’s a plus."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,Best Quality Sound,I like this product because it’s in great packaging. Very nice product and great sound quality. It’s very better earbuds then I bought it before. A+++
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-18,There ok,The static and sometimes it the microphone goes out and people can’t hear me
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-18,Overall not bad for price!,"I waited for awhile to give these a review because I wanted to really use them before I put one in. The first month if use they were fantastic, then out of the blue one day the volume level just dropped, if I were to have my phone at full volume they are no longer as loud as they used to be at half volume. The battery life has been alright it took a bit of a drop as well, used to be able to listen for 5 hours before charge now um lucky if they last 4 hours. Overall I'm not disappointed with the product I would get them again if these completely go bad."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-19,Great sound,Great fitting and sounding earbud
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-19,Great Headphone for Music not Calling,"For such a cheap wireless headphone, it was better than the JBL free I had which is double the price. The sound quality is phenomenal and I love how I can choose which ear to listen from. The only thing I dont quite like is that the bluetooth calling is terrible. The other person couldnt hear me at all, which was quite disappointing. Overall, great sound quality for music and such a great buy."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-19,Great value!,Great price and sound!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-19,better than expected,"Sound quality is good, i cant compare to other earbuds, but for the price I am ecstatic. Noise cancelling is just ok. Battery life is phenomenal. I love that the case allows wireless charging."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-19,don’t buy for calls,"microphone doesn’t work well unless you hold it up to your mouth when speaking, which kinda defeats the purpose of wireless. however it’s good if you’re only using it to listen. connects well, automatically with devices"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-19,"OKish sound, horrible microphone, falls of the ear.","Horrible microphone, no one can hear me. Sounds is OKish... What good is the water resistance when the thing does not even stay in your ear?"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-19,Very good sound.,For the price they have really good sound and are comfortable in the ear. Battery life could be longer. Would recommend them as a whole.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-20,Great Noise Cancellation,"The noise cancellation on these are excellent. I usually walk 1 or 2 hrs per day to the local park. Even with all the car noises, i can still listen to my music or podcast. Battery life is long enough for your workouts or cardio session. This one is a little bit bigger then other earbuds i own but it fits perfect for my ears. Bluetooth pairing is as usual, quick and easy with any phone or devices with bluetooth support. It uses the new USB-C cable for charging. Good little earbuds if you want to go wireless."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-20,Just good as the samsung earbuds,"Good earbud. Easy to pair and use, sound quality is good when comparing to a Samsung buds. Happy with the purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-20,Great ear plugs!,"These are good looking earplugs. They are not too. If and fit right into my ear. I went running and they didn’t fall out. Plus I like how it blends with my ear. The sound quality is pretty good. I have no complaints. During my meetings, no one tells me to mute because they hear the echo of the car. Make sure you adjust your volume before putting anything in your ear"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-20,Value for money,Good
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-20,"Good Sound, even better customer service",Love the sound but first pair stoped working within 2 months. Good news is the company replaced them immediately with no hassle.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-20,Low quality,One my ear buds just quit for no reason.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-20,bass no good,the no good. you have to push or hold the ear bud to feel the bass
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-20,Excellent Earbuds,These earbuds are great for the price. The sound quality is incredible. The base is very good as well. I’ve had these for a few months and have only had to charge the case a couple times. I use them every day.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-21,Great sound,"Great sound in every kind of music I’ve tried—Blues, rock, folk and classical all sound wonderful. Customer service is beyond great. Had an issue with one bud, they replaced it, without any hassle and super fast. Highly recommend the earbuds and the company"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-21,Works better than expected,I purchased this item as a sacrificial set of earphones. I go through them pretty often so I don't like spending too much money. These are better than expected. They come in a case that charges them when stored. When removed from the case they connect right away to the phone and work. I don't have to mess with them to connect which is great. Sound isn't super loud but good enough. Phone calls sound nice and clear. I haven't used them in the summer when I get things wet and sweaty but so far a few months and I haven't killed them. I will probably buy another set when I ruin these which is inevitable.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-21,Worth price guys.,The product came with a very good packaging. Has buttons on the earbuds to pause/play and play with volumes. Definitely worth the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-21,Great wireless buds!,"Bought these for my husband, and he loves them! The are small and light weight and he said that they are really clear. The call quality is good too. Not bad!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-21,Best affordable option there is!!!!,"Wireless charging, type-c wired charging. Great Bass, and overall quality of sound. My girlfriend has the Samsung Buds which cost me $120, and the EarFun sound slightly louder, although they don't have all the options of the Samsung Buds. Only complaint is right earbud must be taken out of case in order to use left by itself."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-21,Mic does not work well,Mic does not work well. People on the other end of the line complain about not hearing me.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-21,One earbud plays significantly lower than the other. Edit: Fast Customer service solution,"I have had a few full wireless earbuds before and overall I did really like these. Case holds a charge for a while which was an issue i had with other and pairing and controls were great. Really like them. That was until the right earbud stopped playing music at the same volume as the left. If this was a 5-10% difference i probable wouldn't have even noticed but this is multiple fold difference in volume between them. I have been frequently taking the left on out to even see if the right is playing at all because it is that much quieter. This isn't even something that occurred after thousands of hours of use, i have not even had to charge to case yet. Update:
Reached out to Earfun about the issue. They promptly sent me a new pair that is working great. Excellent Customer service. These earbuds are great!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-22,Must have deep ears,Tough keeping them in my ears
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Easy listening,"Listening to music is an indispensable part of life.The product packaging is exquisite, the material is good, does not have the peculiar smell.The wireless monitoring method is proved to be effective."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-22,Great value and performance for price,"Great product. Fit with working out can be an issue, but overall great value and performance for the money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Wireless charging and quick sync with bluetooth,"Got these for my little cousin as Airpods pro are too expensive for him hehe. Went with these under 50 in case he loses them. These are fantastic, it pretty much cover everything airpods have to offer. It is smaller than airpods actually so more slick. The battery life is decent, which were able to last for long car rides and the case can charge it 3 more times fully. It comes with USB-C charging cable for the case, but it also works with wireless charger! Noise cancelation is not comparable to airpods pro of course, but it was expected. Sound quality is better than expected and can there are sensor controls on the headphone itself when playing to adjust volume and skip songs. Overall, I think this is very high quality headphone at a affordable price, great gift!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Best earbuds I’ve tried,"I have tried quite a few pairs of earbuds. These are my favorite! They fit my ears well, so the noise gets blocked out pretty well. Sound quality is good. The battery also last a long time. One of my favorite part about these is the buttons on the earbuds. I hate the touch buttons. They are too sensitive. These buttons are perfect! I don’t accidentally push them. The magnet on the case is strong. The earbuds are in there very securely. I wish the lid is see through, but that’s just a minor preference of mine. Doesn’t take away from the product. 10/10 would recommend!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Left Earbud stopped working after 4 months- Great Refund Policy,"The left earbud stopped working after a few months. However, they issued a refund and I'm very content with the purchase. Their 18-month warranty came in awfully handy. Outstanding service. I really do enjoy the headphones as they weren't too expensive and the noise cancelling was really good."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-22,Keep falling out of my ear,Kids falling out of my ear
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Great value,Great product for the price
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-22,One of the best,Bass is good. Connection is fast. Comfort is not the best though.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Quality Headphones!,"Very pleased with the sound quality of these headphones. Crisp, clean sound with a powerful bass. They come with three sizes of ear buds (small, medium, large) so you'll be able to find that perfectly snug fit that creates a good noise cancelling effect. BONUS - the waterproofing is no joke. I wore these in the shower the first day and it was the best shower of my life. You don't get the true noise cancelling effect in the shower, so don't expect to put them on and not hear the water running, however I didn't have any problem hearing the highs and lows of my music while listening in the shower. Battery life is about 3-4 hours depending on how you're using them (max volume, lot's of microphone voice control etc) but the case it comes with charges them automatically, also has a cool 4 LED light display to indicate about how much battery life you have. One thing I loved was the automatic pairing and how easy it was. As soon as they are removed from the charging dock they go into pairing mode, one of the simplest set ups I've ever used. Great product, if you don't want to spend the money on big brand name headphones, these get the job done perfectly!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Competition Game is ON,"I love these! Why? They support wireless charging and they are lightweight. And they have amazing sound quality. No kidding. Among my previous 10 purchases of bluetooth earbuds, these are going to be #1. Played audio tests on Youtube and was able to hear all the possible sounds. Stereo tests and mono tests passed. As you as you take both buds out of the charging case - will be connected to your phone automatically. Put only ONE back. Switches to MONO mode. They won't fall off your ears - so don't you worry! Samsung's Galaxy Earbuds who? EarFun wins!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-23,Ok for the price.,"Inconsistent connectivity when removed from case.. only about 4-5hrs of continuous play/talk time.. Case is too bulky, which makes it not pocket friendly.."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-23,Worked as advertised,Worked as advertised
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Awesome,Great product. Only complain is no noise cancelation which sucks because I work in a noisy environment. But awesome product besides that
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-23,Good design and light weight,"I bought three different earbuds on Amazon (to my dad and brother). This one has a good sound quality and design. It fits and not hurts my ears. However, it is having some difficulties on pairing when several available devices are available around. It is still good in average."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Fails in reliability... Wins in customer experience!!,"*****UPDATE 2020.03.04*****
Their product may still have some problems in some units, however their customer service is remarkable! I would definitely purchase from them again. After reviewing my rating and reading my comment, they sent me an email and offered to replace the earbuds or refund what I paid for them. It's amazing! I expected to take a total loss with this purchase and within less than 5 minutes of receiving their email with the offer and replying, everything was resolved! They are winning the game with customer service, an extremely crucial factor in business, especially for them as a young company. *****UPDATE 2020.03.04*****
It only lasted less than a week before the left earbud failed and the volume was too low for it to be useful. About two or three weeks later the right earbud failed as well and it was also too low for it to be useful. I set them aside on my bookshelf and haven't touched them since. Luckily it was inexpensive compared to what's out there, however for the same price I could have bought excellent wired earbud headphones with way better sound, noise cancellation and call quality."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Best earbuds ever!!!!👍,These ear buds r awesome for the price!! !👍 best earbuds I've ever had actually....I use them at work....can walk into another room and they don't cut off....great distance and sound and the charging box they're in is small and awesome!!! Definitely recommend these buds!!! Easy pairing too!! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Compact Design,Compact design made these great to have at work for breaks as well as walking every evening.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-23,It's ok.,It really cute noise a lot. It's cheap. But it doesn't fit the same on both ears. The one thing I don't like the most is that I often have to pair it or sometimes the left one doesn't work and have to reset it.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,These USB C Earbuds charge rapidly and perform well,"There’s too many bad earbuds out there with low battery lives and that charge using micro-USB. These earbuds, however, are certainly a cut above. First of all the case can QI charge. Secondly, if you decide to do a wired mode, they charge using USB-C, which means the juice up at lightning speed. I am very impressed. The sound quality is good – these are not noise canceling but they are noise dampening. I use as my daily commuter headphones. They are high enough quality that I don’t mind using them and using them for long periods but they’re inexpensive enough that if they broke or I lost them, I wouldn’t be too devastated. That being said, these are of a higher quality than most of the other floating around on this site"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-23,They are still good earphones despite the cons,"Keeping it simple had these for a month now
Pros
1 Fit amazing and never fell out of my ear
2 Tested the water proof by dropping them in a glass of water and still work great
3 Battery lasts for days
4 Noice cancellation is also great
Cons
1 The microphone for calls are not consistent and is a struggle to talk in
2 The sound is okay but these earphones do not have much volume. I have to put it in Max in order to enjoy my music
3 Little bass"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Great product for the price,I really like the wireless charging features and the battery case usually have enough charges for a couple of days
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-23,Great sound quality.,"I haven't had luck getting the controls on the right to work. Both buds have great sound quality though so I am not disappointed. And the noise cancellation works, I can't hear anything. Good purchase."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-24,Sound,Sound and bass as good as an apple airpods
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-24,Mic quality is so bad; don't buy if you do a lot of calls.,"Their size is a little on the big side but they are comfortable, HOWEVER, the main issue that i had with one pair and when ordered a replacement had the same issue is that the mic quality is so bad. When I call someone they constantly say they can’t hear me or my voice keep cutting or going from too far to too close. I recorded my voice more than once and they did sound exactly like that; gets too clear then too far and cutting. The sound quality is just alright, flat and no bass and also not consistent , sometimes is loud and sometimes you feel it’s missing. I’d highly suggest investing your money in a better quality pair. Thanks."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-24,Great earbuds,"I got these earbuds for my son for Christmas and he loves them great quality, Great noise cancellation and great battery life."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-24,Great Headphones,Work as advertised. I had a problem with one of the earbuds. Contacted their customer service and the next day they replied with a solution and the solution worked perfectly. I was very impressed with their prompt customer service and helpfulness. Going to buy their newest model when available!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-24,Right ear bud issues,Awesome!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-24,Disappointed Mine were defective. Trouble shooting is condescending and rude,this product has issues and didn’t work for me but the company refunded my money and was attentive.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-24,Awful for phone calls,"If you need earbuds for phone calls, this is not a good choice. The other parties cannot hear you if there is any background noise at all. Spend a few more dollars."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-24,Pretty good...but,"I wanted to like these so much but
Pros: USB C CHARGER & WIRELESS CASE CHARGING
Ipx 7
Cons: had some connection issues with my phone and a couple of times randomly
Call issues, friends said i would cut in and out and sounded like i was talking from a tube"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-25,"Great earbuds for the price, customer service is....eh.","Overall a great earbuds for the price. Sound quality is good. The mids and highs are a little muttled, the bass is solid but not overbearing. The build quality is good. Battery life is good as advertised. The extras at this price range are nice like the USB C, wireless charging and the Bluetooth 5.0. that being said their customer service it terrible! My earbuds either didn't come with the extra eartips or I lost them in unpacking them. Email customer service and was told to buy more eartips on Amazon and they don't have extra. I was willing to pay for them even. I just would like the ones made for the earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-25,Having fun with earfun,Ease of use. Automatically connect to phone when removed from case. Wireless charging also a nice feature
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-25,Charge in the case,Netflix's
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-02-25,Pretty good buds,"First impressions were a little iffy, the case doesn’t close or open well. Seems like the magnet isn’t too strong to keep it closed. I got white, I’d recommend black if you want it to look neater. But the sound is great! I love the buttons and how they feel. The ear tips are very soft, and very comfortable. The sound quality is nice, and the buttons work well. Easy to fit in my ear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-25,Great budget earbuds!!!,"Not bad at all. Good high quality sound, great fit and definitely a top budget wireless earbuds. Great charging case and would recommend if you’re looking for some nice inexpensive earbuds for typical everyday or maybe temporary use. These ‘buds will do the job and work just great in the meantime if you’re waiting for AirPods or seeking to replace them with those high dollar ones in the future. Perfect to keep as a back up pair!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-25,Lacking consistently,"Read a lot of reviews, found myself let down. I am going to spend the extra money and get a brand name pair."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-25,"Great, until they randomly stopped working","Truly loved these. They automatically convert to mono sound when using just one earbud, which was a big necessity for me, since I work at a hospital and need to be able to hear people. But they broke after using them for just five weeks of three shifts/week. Guess I'm not that surprised given the cost, just sucks because before they randomly stopped working, they were amazing earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-25,Much better than Air pods!,"No these aren't audiophile quality buds. For the money, you're not going to find much better. With the air pods: When my wife calls as I'm out for a walk, she says it sounds like your in a storm, or there's a lot of background noise. When I got these new buds she says they sound a lot clearer a lot less background noise. Music sound just as good if not better than the air pods. I'll stick with the ear fun free."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-26,Good Quality,"Other than being a bit big for my ear, I like them. Sound and battery life is good."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-26,sometimes it charges sometime it doesnt,"sound quality is ok, but the charging is iffy , sometimes it charges sometimes it doesnt"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-26,Good for your money,Love this product. Compact and convenient. Good quality and blocks noise very well. Only problem doesn't sit super well when running
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-02-26,Love the wireless ear buds.,Easy to pair and use and the battery life is more than enough.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-26,Comfortable fit,Fit well in my ears. Doesn’t make them sore or fall out while working. What I really love is it’s noise canceling quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-26,Great for doing yard work.,Great product! I've bought three of them now and given two away as gifts.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-27,well worth taking a look,Well worth the small price
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-27,"Outstanding battery, great support","I received a pair for Christmas. Had an issue where the right bud was discharging in the case. I was sent a replacement overnight, outstanding support. I use these in the gym 4-5 times a week. The fit is good, I can walk quite far away(80-90 feet) from my phone without issue. Most impressive is battery life, I charged the case for the first time this week and have been using them since early January, likely close to 40 hours. Would highly recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-27,Sounds great and stay in ears,"These have been great. The Charge on the ears are pretty long but that case charge is amazing!!! Ive only had to charge the case once since i've received them and that was a month in between. I use them pretty often but not constantly so the charge may vary. They seem to stay in my ears pretty well, I haven't gone on a run with them but they dont feel loose when I walk or move around."
EarFun,Free,4,0,2020-02-27,They are so big!,"Let me just start by saying I love these, I think they are fantastic for the price and the sound quality that they deliver. The battery life is also awesome, I haven’t tested it to see if it’s true to what they claim but I hardly ever remember to charge these and when I do they still seem to have a lot left. Buuuuut my biggest problem is that they are huge, or maybe my ears are tiny idk, all I know is I look a bit ridiculous with them. Thankfully my hair covers them up for the most part. I understand why they are big, because the cheaper tech is bigger, that is my biggest issue with these. I also notice that after a while of wearing them, like an hour, my ears feel sore when I remove them but it’s probably because they are huge... oh well I can get over it for the price and sound."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-27,Very pleased. Would recommend.,"I have the older version without volume control (also cannot use them independently). Ignoring the lack of that feature, I really like these earbuds. I was looking for something that had type-C charging that wasn’t too pricey. I purchased these on a Black Friday sale and saved even more, which contributed to my choosing this brand. The fact that they have wireless charging as well was a bonus. They take a little getting used to sitting in my ears, but they’re not uncomfortable. I’m no audiophile, but I was very impressed with the sound quality considering their price point. There is no active noise canceling, so if that’s important to you make sure you get a good fit from the silicone tips but there will still be sound bleed. The buttons are nice and clicky and do not require so much force as to hurt your ear. Do take caution as you take them out because of the suction. I haven’t clocked the battery life and I don’t listen to them for very long periods of time, but I have not had an instance where they died or were dead when I pulled them out of the case. When I think about it I sit the case on the wireless charger (or occasionally plug it in) and have not gotten it below 25%. The only issue I have had with them is the L bud randomly would not pair. I followed the reset and repair directions in the manual to no avail. I emailed support and they promptly replied with the correct instructions (perhaps I got the instructions for the new buds but actually received the older model). Once I did that they were working again. I haven’t had any issues since then. If you’re considering these, go for it. If you have an issue, reach out to support via email."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-27,Great Sound Quality and Value!,"I was in the market for true wireless earbuds to pair with my iPhone XR but was NOT willing to spend $150+. My wife and I are going to be traveling more and wanted to have reliable, decent quality buds to listen to music and movies while traveling. My priorities for the purchase were: 1) cost - under $60, 2) audio quality, 3) battery life (more than 4 hrs. on a charge) and 4) wireless case charging. I looked at about a dozen different options in that price range and researched (almost obsessively) reading and watching reviews on each. After about 4 hours of research, I landed on the Earfun Free true wireless earbuds. They just arrived today and man did they check all the boxes! First, $45 was well inside the budget I had given myself. Two, the audio quality is ridiculously good. I had to make an EQ adjustment on my phone (went to the ""flat"" setting) to get the best sound quality across the range of base, mids and treble sounds. But sound is rich and distortion free across the full range of frequencies. Three and four, I have only tested for about 2.5 hours so have not tested and confirmed the total charge life of 6 hrs but I have wirelessly charged the case and it works just as presented. The buds are also feathery light and fit firmly yet comfortably in the ear. If you are looking for incredible sound quality on a budget buy these Earfun Free earbuds. You will not be disappointed!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-27,"These are great, highly recommended!","I did a lot of looking when buying wireless buds, didn’t want to spend apple money for something that’s going to fall out of my ear and also didn’t want garbage buds either (the market is saturated) I would tell anyone to go ahead with these. I can vouch that they are truly waterproof (worn in shower), they do work independently if you only want to wear one at a time (reviews that say only “right” side can be used independently are wrong) and they sound pretty good and battery lasts. Oh and I’ve worn to the gym and never had one fall out. Buy these and call it good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-27,Amazing quality,I use these everyday at work. The battery long last and the quality of the sound is really clear with perfect bass.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-28,Great deal. Great sound,These are the best earbuds I have ever had. Had to get the kids earbuds they keep taking my. So got these for myself. They are great. Nice fit. Great sound. Don’t over pay for high dollar earbuds. These are great.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-28,Surprisingly GREAT product!!!!,"This was such a pleasant surprise! Super easy, intuitive pairing with iPhone. GREAT sound and very comfortable!! Would absolutely purchase this again or as a gift! Thank you!! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-28,Sound cancelling,These are great for sound cancelling. I use them on the bus and it helps me relax. I can't even hear the other passengers.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-28,"Meh, I've had better success with other cheaper ear buds","Was good at first, bought two of them because I like having an extra set be charged, do that I can swap them out, but now one set wont charge the either earbuds, despite the case being fully charged. The other one stopped charging the right ear bud. They only lasted about a month."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-28,Impressive quality,"I'm quite impressed by the quality of these earbuds. Make, sound and battery life get 5 stars."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-28,👍🏻,"I bought these for my son and he loves them. I borrowed them just to see if they hurt my ears, they were so comfortable. They have great sound to them."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-02-28,"Bad for phone, great for listening and comfort","Bought this twice. 1st one was defective: low battery life, horrible mic. Very comfortable and good sound. Based on comfort and sound, I returned it and got another. No problem with battery, still comfortable and good sound. The mic was bad. I use BT headphones for all work calls. I had nothing but complaints about inability to hear me, fade in and out while sitting at desk. I'd recommend to anyone who doesn't want to use it for phone."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-28,problems using with Kindle.,doesn't work correctly with kindle (one side works allways and the other side fades in and out often) but works fine with apple. My 13-yeard-old loves them. If they worked for my kindle is five them 4 stars.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,good sound quality and great but.,"performs 90% of the expensive buds at 1/4 the price. and really, if you lose one of these you won’t cry about it."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-29,Would work great in office environment! Works great with some motorcycle helmets.,Battery life for me has been around 10 hours. Sound quality has been good. Gripes: Doesn’t stay in ear well if moving around a lot.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Love them!,These are great! They are comfortable and light. You can’t beat the price.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-29,The sound quality of these is awful,"Terrible, terrible sound quality and no mic. Wish I had saved the extra money and just replaced my airpods with airpods."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Impressed,"I use earphones a few hours a day. Needed a portable option. These are great. Love the size of the case, they fit comfortably. Sound quality is good and great battery life. Perfect for on the go!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Works great,Got these and used them for the first time at the gym yesterday. They worked great once I got them in the right position for my ear. Definitely a great purchase!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Great Buy for money,"Works great, good sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Easy pairing,"Easy pairing. Out of the case, into the ear, pair with device, done"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,"For the money, very nice true wireless earbuds","First let me say these sound amazing for the 49.99 they cost. The included magnetic charging case, and underside attached charging cable is a very nice touch. Bluetooth pairing to my phone was painless and quick. I have smaller ears, and these feel to be overly large in my ears. The added rubber ring help, but not much. I can see using these to cut the grass, or while playing my drums. But more than a hour would be uncomfortable in my opinion. These need to be more contoured the inside of your ear. Subtracted a star for this. These have 3 different eq settings. Pressing the left button 1x turn volume down, 1x on the right side button volume up. You can answer phone calls, skip/pause songs. Very nice features on these lower budget earbuds. Battery life was great, charging is fast, around a hour and a half when dead. I recommend these, but for shorter use. The best part is you can use the case as a portable power bank as you can charge your phone using your battery, i know it may not charge the full phone from 0% but would definitely get you some juice when your phone is drained out. Overall a good purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Great product,"Excellent sound, waster proof, reasonable price, and long battery life"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-29,Do NOT buy if you need to use for calls,"This product is ok for listening to music and the speakers are fine but if you are like me and use your earbuds for talking then these earbuds are not for you. I had a problem, notified their support and they sent another pair. Second pair had the exact same issue. Whenever I'd talk to anybody on the phone they complained of the sound quality and missing words. I narrowed the issue down to the noise-cancellation. Even a mouse-click would engage the poor noise-cancelling on these and cancel your speech as well....not a good design. They are pretty good for listening to music though. Received a full refund after posting a 1-star rating, that evidently got their attention and they sent the refund."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-01,Not worth it,Work well in beginning then stop
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-01,Great value for bluetooth earbuds!,"I found that the sound quality and range on these are great. I initially bought these so I could listen to my audiobooks while I lay down with my baby without the fear of her snatching the cords of a normal earphones. The sound has good mid and excellent treble but lacks on the bass a little. I was able to walk all over my house and they stayed connected with no distortion, delay, or static whatsoever while listening to music. I tried to call my spouse to see the mic quality and unfortunately it was not working as well as I had hoped. The call was choppy and it sounded like we were underwater with the volume going up and down. My initial purpose for buying this was to listen to things anyway so it didn't really bother me that much. I personally have small ear canals and sometimes find it difficult for earbuds to stay in my ears. The default buds of these fit perfectly for me and did not budge while doing anything at all. They are extremely comfortable and great for the price!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-01,Very good,Good
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-01,Unhappy with product,Quit charging after 2 months of use.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-02,The sounds quality,Like them alot
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-02,Sound good and fit comfortably. Can’t figure out if/how to skip song,These fit comfortably in my ear and overall are pretty good. I can pause what I’m listening to and answer calls at the click of a button where the logo is on the earbud. I couldn’t figure out a way to skip a song though. Setup instructions were relatively easy to follow and they come in a handy case. They can also be charged on my wireless charger which I didn’t realize when purchasing but is actually helpful.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-02,Absolutely love them!,Sound is very good. Features are great..... volume up and down; skip forward and back; pause; microphone for phone calls (works very well); auto pairing; charging case and magnetic case lid and magnetic buds to case for charging. Love the fit and the fact that they are waterproof. Great pair of earbuds for the price. Adjust the equalizer to your liking and enjoy!
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-03-02,Good Earphones,I got these earphones as a gift from my cousin and I found that I really love them. They have really good quality sound and last for a long time. I would definitely recommend others to purchase them as a gift or even for themselves.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-02,"A fine transition into true wireless earbuds, but much to be improved","Relative to other true wireless earbuds I'm sure these pale in comparison, but as my first pair I have to say I'm relatively pleased. I have had no problem with battery life, even with all day intermittent use, and they sound just fine. There are three big issues that I have run into. Firstly, both earbuds need to be removed from the case in order to pair with my phone. Sometimes I only need one, but I still need to take both out, wait for them to connect, then put one back. Additionally sometimes one headphone won't pair properly when taken out, so it has to be put back and taken out again. Secondly, the controls are terrible and not customization. The only one that it remotely usable is the play/pause, but the forward/back controls are difficult to pull off and exclusive to the left and right headphones respectively, meaning that you can only skip forward or back when wearing one headphone. And the controls can be awkward to use because of my third point: comfort. These things are SO HARD to get comfortable in your ears. Even if they shift a little during wear, they suddenly plunge into your ear or seal into your ear canal or the audio just becomes muffled or distorted. The more I use them the more I get used to them, but they are definitely a bit of a pain in the butt."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-02,It stopped charging after a month or less of use,"Edit : they sent me new ones and they are working great, I could be happier."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-03,Wireless Bluetooth earbud,Wireless Bluetooth..This what i am looking for.Good for my office use. Easy to connect and long battery life. Got in White color.Best at this price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-03,Very loud - overall truly pleased.,"I was truly surprised by the sound and quality of these headphones - I honestly didn't expect much from these until I opened the box in which it was packaged fairly nicely in. It also includes a nicely made charging case that holds and charges your headphones. I was surprised with the sound quality coming from these. I was a little skeptical with how they would fit also with my ears being so tiny, but they fit perfectly and come with the different size tips. Overall I am very pleased with these :)"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-03,Earfun,"Don’t expect much quality, you’re paying $30 for these earbuds"
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-03-03,Big improvements,This my second Tozo and the T6 is a big improvement over the T10.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-03,Long lasting battery,"EarFun earbuds really offer up to 6 hours of battery life, which is not matched in the price range they are offered. I can wear them for hours without discomfort. They stay in the ear and don't stick out too much. Sound is clear and loud."
EarFun,Free,2,0,2020-03-03,Ok earbuds (if you can make them fit in your ears),"I really like the battery life. I don't think they ever died on me as long as I've been using them and that's a major plus. Why not 5 Stars? Well, two major flaws:
Flaw #1: Eartips are flimsy and tend to pressure up against my ears. That means the air gets trapped between my eardrums and the earbuds which is really uncomfortable. This is the only pair of earbuds I've even owned with this problem. Tried all 3 sizes included, same problem. I think the Silicone material is too soft, should've added more filler and less silicone for optimal Shore hardness, also the walls are too thin which compounds the issue. Flaw #2: The buds are extremely slick, tough to grab a hold of. I dropped them several times on dirty floor. What they need is just some textured pattern on sides, is that too much to ask? Positives:
- great battery life for buds and charging case
- well built
- bluetooth works like it should, few connectivity issues
- solid sound quality
Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but I would appreciate if Earfun came up with more ""solid"" eartips and sent me a pair (before I give up and buy some other earbuds!!!) Update 03-2020 -
I had to downgrade from 3 star to a 2 star rating. The reasons are described below:
- the fit is really annoying in my ear. I have to waste time try to find a ""sweet spot"" just so I can still listen. I have to have them slightly pulled out so they won't lock-up the pressure inside my ear, but when i do that I'm losing sound quality and volume becomes an issue. The problem is worse when turning my head to the side or up and down
- i just tried a pair of wireless Skullcandy Crusher over the ear headphones and the sound just blows away the Earfun in every aspect. This is not what I've expected for $50. I just ordered a pair of Cambridge Audio Melomania buds, hopefully they will deliver what I'm looking for and I will post a review on those once I test them."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-03,Hard to get out of the case,"Nice product, good sound and talk quality but it's very difficult to get the buds out of the case not very useful"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-03,Good fit,It's a worthful product and great fit to me
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-03,Just what I needed,Great deal for the price
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-04,Charges quickly and sound quality is great!,"I got these wireless earbuds as a gift for my husband. His previous one from a different brand does not compare to this one. These earbuds charge quickly and the sound qualify is excellent. I borrowed it from him and listened to music without any interruption. It definitely does cancel out other noises. He uses at them at work to talk to me because he isn't allowed to use his phone. The battery life is very good. We only had to charge it once thus far. It's such a difference from regular wired earbuds. You don't have to be a tech pro to figure out how to use these earbuds. I showed my mom and now even she wants one. Call quality is clear and sound is excellent. Overall, these are high-quality earbuds that actually block out sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-04,Great value,"Impressed with the battery life, compact size, and comfort. Highly recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-04,Great buy!,"Sounds great, long battery life, and extremely portable"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-04,Great purchase,All in all great purchase. First time with true wireless earbuds and pleased
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-04,very unconfortable,"This product is so BIG it hurts the inside of the ear, you cannot stay with this for more than 30 minutes"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-04,AirPods Competitor,"Compared to AirPods, this is by far the most interesting as well as best low price competitor I have come across. As a tech enthusiast, I have not yet seen or heard any other wireless earbuds that could really compete with AirPods. Yes, the shape of this product looks less than that of AirPods. But in terms of sound quality, it stays on par with the AirPods. As a professional musician, I could instantly tell that the engineers for this product has put time into the sound production. However, the charging could definitely by faster as I would consider this as an AirPods alternative if it was slightly better."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-04,Great Heaphones!,"I bought these on a whim. I saw that they were Qi compatible and my Tacoma has a Qi charging pad so these were an obvious choice for me. Also, I have really small ears and have a tough time finding earbuds that fit my ears and stay in during working out or running. These are excellent. I could not have been happier. The charging case is great. I have a Google Pixel 2 XL and I like the fact that these are USB-C. If I do need to charge them with a cable then it's one less cable I have to worry about carrying around with me. My previous ear buds were Power Beats, and I don't notice any significant difference in sound quality."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-04,"Battery Life, Noise","The battery life could have been better. Noise cancellation is not that much good as well, but is okay overall. Price is also a little high."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-05,"Good earbuds for a good price, charges wirelessly!","These are som pretty descent earbuds for the price. They come in their own charging case and the sound is very good. No problems connecting to my iPhone. The charging case allows for wireless charging which is a very convenient feature. I wish the charging case had a standard USB port though. All in all, very good quality headphones!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-05,Great ear buds,Once I changed the inserts to the small. Fits like a glove. Now I can’t hear my wife nag. Sound and bass is nice and battery last about 2 days.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-05,Maybe my favorite earbuds yet?,I’ve bought and tried a bunch of different budget earbuds. But this is the first in this price range I’ve tried that had usb C charging and a case that can wirelessly charge itself which is amazing. But besides that I just love these earbuds in general! Sound quality is great. I can use one at a time at work. And they’re just pretty!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-05,Best $50 buds on Amazon,Use them@work. At a low volume they last 1.5 work days. Hardly any cutting out.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-05,GREAT for any size ears,WOW. If this style suits you you have to buy these. Ive tried several and found the treble to be lacking or the buds didn't work for my ears. These satisfy with great tight bass nice mids and treble where you here the cymbals no longer are they way back well behind the stage. i think at this price point the imaging and sound guality is amazing. I listen to rock n roll. i cant tell you how relieved and pleased with the sound quality and call quality for under 50. with wireledss charging and usb-c you wont regret this purchase.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-05,Don't buy.,Bought these for my son. Right side barely has any volume. Very disappointed. Will try and contact company and see if they will make it right otherwise I will send back.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-06,Charge does hold,Neither buds or case hold the charge as advertised.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-06,I love them.,I LOVE these. I use them to do yoga in the morning so I don’t disturb my husband. I use them to listen to audio books while I’m doing chores around the house. I use them on walks to listen to music. I wouldn’t say they have the best sound quality or noise canceling features but they get the job done for me and were a great price. I love the charging case and bought a charging pad for ease. Great product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-06,Perfect headphones for a great price,"After I lost my airpods, I couldn't get myself to purchase another pair due to the high cost, so I opted out and looked around for other brands of wireless headphones. These Earfun earbuds are perfect for me for the price. They came in a really nice packaging, and the sound is great. They will be my new gym headphones since there are no wires and also the connection is great, I've never had it disconnect at all yet. Great product, great price, I would buy again."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-06,Good value wireless earbuds.,I had to return the first pair due to the left earbud was phasing in and out. The second pair has worked fabulously so far. The sound quality is very good and I love the fact I can use a wireless charger.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-06,Cheaper that galaxy buds but equivalent qaulity!,Great Bargain
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-06,Good sound at fair price,"Good packing when arrived. Connectivity is fast as you start initially and after that it’s plug and play. Touch sensitive controls
Fit is great with different sizes available
Battery is okay
Case is small, compact and easy to carry. A good buy for this price and sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-06,Love this product,I have used these while watching movies and have taken calls. Quality is great! !
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-03-06,"Too good to be true, yet they are!","Amazing wireless earbuds! I use them about 2 hours a day and a single charge lasts me about 2 weeks. They are very comfortable. Sometimes if I take them out after using for a while and reinsert them, the ear pressure feels off. I’ve learned that opening your mouth when replacing them remedies that. (Sounds weird but it has to do with biology and ear pressure be altered by air pressure in your mouth.) Also, they are sufficiently loud, although there are a few rare instances when I wish I could increase pass the max volume, but I’m sure it’s to protect the ears, so I’m okay with it. I’ve already recommended these to several friends and coworkers."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-06,Work great,Good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-06,Great earphones!,Have bought them for my Girlfriend for March 8. I have the same one for last 6 month. Really love them. Sound quality is great! Nothing else to say. Buy them and enjoy!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-06,High Quality & Comfortable,"Purchased these wireless earbuds as a gift. He couldn't be happier with them. They are used repeatedly throughout the day - every day - and the case only needs to be charged every 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. He is very picky about sound, & is still commenting on how high quality the sound is with these earbuds. Since his ears are easily discomforted, we have tried a great number of items. These are very comfortable & stay in place (even on his daily runs). The charging/storage case is of good quality as well. Not at all flimsy. We recommend them highly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-07,Amazing product!,"When I’m not listening to anything I definitely have to take them out because of how good a job they do at noise canceling. The sound is fantastic, they are very comfortable, and the fact that their little case acts as a built in charger for them and acts as a portable charger by itself when disconnected from the wall was a pleasant surprise. For the price I wasn’t expecting anything nearly as high quality or amazing as these turned out to be. They are one of the best purchases I’ve made on Amazon and that’s saying something!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-07,Good for the prime.,They are just ok for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-07,Great performance! Hard getting it out of the cSe.,"The only downside to this earbuds is that due to its shape, it's difficult taking it out oh the case. It's round and slippery so it's difficult to get a good grip on it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-07,Deep bass,The product is great. Bin using it for a while an it really surprised me. Try it you won't regret it!..
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-07,Great product for a great price,Great ear buds. Very comfortable to wear. Very nice sound. Love it.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-07,Great sound for the price..,"Bought a 2nd pair, sound quality and battery life are one of the best.."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-07,Great buy!,I love these. I use have one of them in all day and it does not hurt my ear or fall out. Great purchase! !
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-07,Descent quality,They sound good and the battery life is really good. The only downfall is the size. They make my ears sore after a while.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Great product at a great price.,I usually go for a set of over the ear headphones but I needed a pair that weren't super expensive as I am going to be using these while in bass tournaments. The fact that these have a waterproof rating makes them even better. The sound quality was rather surprising. Not what I was expecting for earbuds in this price range. I have yet to run the batteries dead in them but it's not the fishing season yet. lol. But I like the fact that the case holds a charge as well so I can charge them while out and away from power. overall these beat my expectations for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Good buy,This is my first pair of wireless earbuds. They are a lifesaver at work. They are perfect for everyday use. Very happy with them and they didn't break the bank!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Customer service was good,Gave me another set because of warranty great customer service
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Great value - good buy. No issues,These headphones are a great value. They do block out a lot of sound when you twist them into your ear. There’s no ability to change their blocking but that’s not a listed feature. Sound is good - not the best but def better than a lot of others.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-08,Overall great buy,When you first pull them out of the package you'll probbaly think they're a little awkward looking but once you get used to positioning them in your ears they're amazing. They have great sound quality and I can go about a month without charging (I use them 1-2 hours a day). These buds are hard to beat for $50
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Great sound and easy set up and fit,Product provides great sound and is easy to set up and use. Earbuds stay fit. Great value! !
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-08,Tinny sound,Sound is very tinny. No bass or stereo sound. Good if you listen to podcasts or books. Not great for music.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Great budget true wireless headphones,"Works great for price, exactly why I bought them. I fear losing more expensive brands, but these are affordable to replace if needed, and work great."

EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-09,Connection issues,Continually had to reset the buds. They would drop in volume where I could hardly hear them. Bought a set of jabra 65t
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-09,Great sound quality,"it came charged and ready to use which was great! The pairing was a breeze, just follow the included instructions and you won’t have a problem. The sound quality is amazing! The music seems perfectly clear and balanced, there are no overwhelming tones and you can hear every part of the song. They fit my ears perfectly and don’t fall out, some might find them a little bulky but they work for me! . Other than that these are great headphones! Also, love the wireless charging feature, not only can you just throw the pods in the case to charge but you can also just set the case on a wireless charger and not fuss around with wires. Very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend these to anyone looking for a quality set of Bluetooth earbuds with all the great features"

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-09,"Excellent product, great quality, good sound for a decent price!","Excellent product for a great price. I use them on airlines frequently, I also use them at work (construction based). They sync up quickly without any issues, they sound great and the battery lasts for at least 6 hours. The ear bud push button controls work well and are easy to use."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-09,Look somewhere else please.,"Stopped working in 1 earbud after 3 weeks. Also would constantly fall out of my right ear while working out. If you’re looking for something wireless that stays in your ear during strenuous activity, you can find better."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-09,Pretty good sounding buds with a wireless charging case is a plus!,"Really liked the case, and really like the bass response on these earbuds. I found them to seal well and hold in place well. The wireless charging case is a huge plus after converter to mostly wireless chargers in my house it is really convenient to set them on one and have it charge and not have to worry about forgetting to charge my earbuds when I got to gym so far they have survived a few gym sessions without and major defects or breakdowns would definitely recommend if you are looking for earbuds that hs a wireless charging case!! !"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-09,EarFun Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds,"This was a gift to my husband who loves them. The only reason he is a bit unhappy is because the stems that help you grab them and put them in and out of your ear are a bit slick, and so therefore a bit slippery - making it hard to get them out. Other than that, they're great!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-09,Great earbuds,These fit well without hurting after extended use. They stay in your ear unlike some others. Great sound. Definitely worth trying.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-09,6 month review,"Pros: Good product for the price
Battery life / fairly comfortable fit
Cons: right side not charging after 6 months of use. only use it in the gym for no more than 2 hrs / day"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-09,"Try them, you want go wrong",War fun reached out to me and apologized for the inconvenience I went through. They sent me me another set of Bluetooth earbuds for me to try again. As advertised they are working as ordered no problems whatsoever. So far great product for the money.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-10,Battery life,"At first this product worked really well. But after a couple of weeks, the right side wouldn't stay connected to my devices. Not sure if I recieved a bad one. Suck because I wanted these to work."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,"Extremely comfortable, good sound, and good features.","I'll start by saying I have tried a LOT of true wireless earbuds, from cheaper ones like these, to airpods pros and sonys wf-1000XM3. Of all of the ones I've tried, I would put these as the second best, with only the airpods pro ahead due to their features. For the price you pay, the Earfun Free are nothing short of fantastic. They're small and incredibly lightweight, which makes them great for my small ears. They stay put when most TWS in ears will fall out. The sound on these is great for the price as well. They're well balanced, with a slight low/mid emphasis. You can get better sound, but you'll need to spend significantly more to get it. Call quality on these is also very good, but only in quiet environments. These DO NOT do a good job of cancelling out external noise, so if you need that as a feature, look elsewhere. These also don't have a passthrough function, which is something I'd love to see, but it's very rare to find a pair that does in this price range. Overall, if you want a true wireless earphone that sounds good, has great battery life, and can be used to work out for hours with no issues, these are great. If you need a top tier headset, with great voice capabilities, look elsewhere."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,"Great sound, price, and fit","I usually have trouble with earbuds staying put in my ears, but these fit great, even when I'm on the treadmill. I'm not constantly worried they will be falling out. Easy to set up, great sound quality at the price point, I really can't complain. 10/10 would buy again."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,Great earphone squad,Helping me re condition myself in new ways I never thought possible
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-10,Good for the price.,"Great product for price. They're not Bose, but their good for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-03-10,Not a bad economic choice!!,"this are actually pretty darn good choice if you want good sound, quality and battery life at a cheap price! I haven’t fully test them on everything but once ill do ill make sure to review them again!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,👍🏾👍🏾,Great product
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,Great value true wireless earphones.,"Good sound quality, call quality, and reliable connectivity. Can't beat them for the price point."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,Amazing little ear buds!,"I've only had them for a little over a week but I love these little buds! They connect immediately after taking them out of the charging box, EVERYTIME! They are comfortable and stay in the ear very well. Sound is very crisp and clear...... What more can I say, great ear bud for the price. Get them, they are worth every penny!"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-10,Stops Working Correctly After A Few Weeks,"These ear buds have potential. Upon first arrival for a short while they worked great. Sound quality is nice and I like how they look, feel and fit inside my ears. Unfortunately the ear buds began to act faulty about 3 to 4 weeks in. First it started with the left earbud volume level being extremely low not matching the right side, then a few more weeks after that the right side started to have extremely low volume even though the volume indicator was at max. It got so bad that now the ear buds are acting random. One moment the volume is almost non-existent, then 15+ minutes later the volume gradually increases on it's own. Sometimes it works if I disconnect, then reconnect ear buds to the Bluetooth, but at any moment it can start back at square one not working again. It's pretty annoying and I don't feel I got my money's worth on this product."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-10,"Works great, case was broken.",Earbuds work and fit great. I'd love to give them a better rating but the cover for the case was barely hanging on by a small piece of metal and now is fully detached. They still charge and work good but now they fall out of the case and I'm not currently able to send them back to be replaced.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,Great for the price!,"After reading a slew of reviews I decided to give these a go. The sound is great, no issues pairing to my phone, and they work great when I go out for a run too. Overall couldn't be more pleased!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,Great sound!!,Great sound and bass! Noise cancellation could be better but not a deal breaker! Love them!
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-10,They wouldn’t stay in my ears,They wouldn’t stay in my ear.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-10,"Good sound, but volume discrepencies","I really wanted to like this product. The battery life was good, the sound quality was fine because I very rarely listen to music as I am a talk radio, educational podcast listener, and they charged quickly. Unfortunately, the left right balance was horrible. After about 2 weeks of use, the left pod got noticeably quieter. After going through all the procedures that the Amazon tech support operator could think of, there was no change and I returned them for a second pair. Again after about 2 weeks the left bud became noticeably quieter and could not be fixed. If they could address this left/right quality issue, I would buy them again, but after having 2 pairs fail, I bought a pair of TOZO-10 and have been enjoying them without problem."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-10,Great item,Fits in my ear.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-11,Did not like them.,Definitely the worst Bluetooth headphones I have ever owned. For one no one can hear me when I try to talk to them on the phone and second the headphones randomly connect to my phone even when they are still in the case. So I basically have to turn of my Bluetooth if I want to just listen to something on my phone. And there should not be a picture of a person swimming with these headphones on. The reason I got these was so that I could listen to music while I swim laps but Bluetooth does not work once you go under water.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-11,Not too bad,"Got well, sound good easy to use"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Super compact but has pounding beats,"Got this earbud as an addition to my current one. I had planed to use this for my now weekend bike rides. When I wear this, it doesn't completely block out all sound (very hard even for true noise cancellation), but it blocks out 100% of wind noise which is perfect for my case. The bass on this earphone is superb and the south quality is great for all ranges. I've used this for a full week straight and didn't have to charge the case yet."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-11,A great first impression,"Still testing it, but the sounds is definitely the best from all other ear buds I tested in the past. Queen sounds great and so does Ennio Morricone. Plenty of base and well balanced sound. Will see how well the battery holds up."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-11,Showers will never be the same,Left bud has a noticeable delay.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Great product!,Amazing quality!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-11,Initially great now having problems with volume to low.,Initially loved these. But now the left earbud volume is significantly lower than the right earbud. Would recommend if this was fixed.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Good Quality and Value for money,"Best earpods with great comfort and luxury. I tried many headphones before and was not enough satisfied but these are just perfect fit, Will highly recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Great Earbuds,"Great sound and noise cancellation. Have to get use to the pairing process, once that’s done it’s easy sailing."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Great quality!,Love these headphones! I’ve always wanted a wireless without paying a crazy amount. And I actually like that it’s a big hidden without anything sticking out. Great quality and love the case for travel.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-11,Good sound average mic,Sound qualify is great just that the mic is not great.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-12,Very nice wireless earbuds,"I find these very convenient. While my phone still has a phonejack I thought I would get a pair of wireless earphones. I have found to my surprise that I use them quite frequently. They are very useful when I want to listen to the news or a book or a YouTube in a situation where I want to remain quiet. They are much easier to put on and take off than wired units. They are also nice in situations where I want to be able to listen to outside voices occasionally and for voice sources I will only use one earbud. The pushbutton on each earbud, used to pause sources is also more convenient than I expected although it took me a little while to avoid pushing the button when seating the earbuds. The only partial negatives are twofold:
- I find it more difficult to properly seat the earbuds especially to seal out all outside noise. It can be done, but can occasionally be finicky. They do have a habit of becoming loose with any repetitive activity more vigorous than walking. - The sound quality is pretty good but not the best. When I want to really listen to a source like music, I will still pull out my wired earbuds to listen. Overall, a great investment in a quality product and a great value."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-12,So so ear buds,"Emphasis on bass is a bit too much. I can’t listen to some audio books because the bass makes it too hard to understand. Also every step I take thumps through the ear buds. They go in the charger easily but can be harder to get out. Battery life seems good but I haven’t given them a good test for longevity. They do connect easily and I haven’t had them drop a reasonable connection. In summary, if I was using them every day, I would have returned them. Since I don’t, I’ve kept them to long to return now."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-12,Great wireless earbuds,"The earbuds are amazing! They really do last a long time. They're easily connected to the phone, Bluetooth boom, no hassle. I really like how it's USB-c port instead of micro USB, no hassle to charge the case. Another interesting feature is the wireless charging, that's another neat thing these earbuds have which make them so much more convenient to charge. The call quality is great too, very clear and crisp, can hear the other person clearly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-12,A happy upgrade from my Beats 2 headphones,"I was really upset when I lost my Beats 2 headphones right before a 4 hour flight. Amazon to the rescue. I did some research and heard good things about these headphones so I though about giving them a try. The night before I left on my flight I found my beats headphones...mind you I had just bought this pair of earbuds to replace them and they were arriving later that day. I thought about returning the new earbuds but these are fantastic. The sound quality is as good as my old pair of beats (maybe better). The connectivity seems to be more reliable and I love the charging case it comes with which renews the power each time you store them. Not having any wires is also really nice and they have great noise-blocking ability (im typing this from a plane and the sound is still fantastic. The case is also USB-C so it recharges fast and can also be used on a wireless charging platform - very cool feature. The best part, they were $50. That is really cheap for this level of technology. I have to say I am impressed and I won't be returning them. They are definitely a happy upgrade."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-12,Excellent headphones at the right volume,"I did like these earbuds. They are comfortable (I have large ear openings), they had excellent flat sound (bass, mids, highs were level and quite audiophile-esque, little bump to mid-range, but I like that), they lasted 5 hours right out of the box without a charge (and had more to spare). The buttons work well and they do have volume control unlike some reviews that say they don't (did they even buy these???)... I give the 5 out of 5 because they worked as expected, EXCEPT and have awesome sound, but they have one glaring flaw, that is inherent of ALL earbuds. I list to music and TV at very low volumes. I am 40 and have excellent hearing, because in all these years using earbuds, I listen at 1/4th total volume at the most. Consequently, because I listen at these low volumes, I can hear my breathing, heartbeat, jaw movements, etc on all earbuds I've tried (only 3, a LG, Sony and these). All 3 have this flaw, and I am pretty sure all others will too. I have even tried foam, but that kills the low end and makes the earbuds sound tinty...
So I did end up returning these and going back to over the ear cans... If you listen at moderate to higher volumes, I HIGHLY recommend these! They have exceptional sound for the price. They won't be like Beyerdynamics or Shures, but for $50 you cannot beat the sound."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-12,Pretty good cheap wireless earbuds,"I find these to be pretty good ear buds. I think the fit is a little off for me as they fall out a couple of times during the day but that's sort of expected. Also I feel that they do not get loud enough, I feel they are just a tad to quiet but still very usable, I still use them every day. I wish the left one would work independently. Battery life is great for me usually lasts 6 hours before having to put them in the case to charge."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-13,Transmission issues when using with iPhone X,"Reception was great but when on a call transmission kept fading in and out and, as I use my iPhone X for business, this was unacceptable. I contacted the company and they tried to work with me to no avail. The replaced the buds but this issue persisted. Finally returned them for a full refund."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,Perfect,Perfect for what I needed it to do. Long battery life too compared to the other earbuds I’ve had.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-13,"Great sound, battery life as advertised, great features, nice ergonomics.","Wireless charging, USB-C, good battery life, awesome audible cues, 25% battery audible warning, charging case is not water resistant but I can wear the buds in the shower at the very least. I like the ability to listen to either L or R side independently for continuous podcast listening (one charges while the other plays). I think you can take a phone call on either one independently, but can't confirm. Volume/track has to be controlled from the device if only using one side. Audio quality is great, delay is low. The passive noise cancelling is solid. Active noise cancelling with a listening feature like the latest Bose have would be nice, but definitely not expected at this price point at the time of writing. I use an app that uses the phone's microphone and pumps that sound to the headphones so you can hear your surroundings when necessary, and the delay is less than non-BT 5.0. The ability to be paired and broadcasting to the headphones and another device at the same time can be useful as well. The case feels a bit cheap, but is acceptable, especially given the features/specs. I've used a few other similar wireless ear buds at multiple price points, higher and lower, and I am calling these a favorite when it comes to a balance between the latest features, both build and sound quality, and price."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-13,IF YOU PLAN TO USE THESE FOR CALLS........DONT!!!!,The build quality is good....comfortable in the ear and great to listen to music but if you have to take a call.....DONT do it with the buds connected. Any sentence with more than two words is just muffled or muted for the person on the other end of the phone. Its it terrible!!!!!! I never write reviews but I wanted to save someone the annoyance of having to disconnect you buds just to have a convo on the phone were they can hear you clear.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-13,Good buds but may not fit.,I will have to return these earbuds but I will say they had good sound quality and a good build. I used them solid for about a week and never had to charge the case. Used 4-5 hours a day. I do wish they got a little louder. The major downside I had was the left bud would just fall out of my ear. To no fault of Earfun it's just I need something that secures to my ears better.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,Amazing fun earbuds,"These were one of the first type C Earbuds to be listed on Amazon. Had them for months. Amazing battery life, easy to put on and off, have lasted the test of time, and supported charging from MacBook chargers as well. The only downside is the size can be bit bulky so it sticks out of fitted style pants, but relative to other models, it is no bigger."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,High quality - Low cost!,Bluetooth earbuds work exactly how they should. Great sound. Excellent battery life. My kids love them!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,Great value,"Received these on Jan 28, 2020. I wanted to wait and use these before I gave a review. I will have to say these are by far some of the best value for the money. I use these every day at work to help the night go by faster. Now, I do not listen to them the whole night but on average of a few hours a night and only in one ear. The only issue I have with these is that they are a bit bulky for my liking. They do fit perfectly in my ears, do not move once they are in. Sound quality is great, bass, noise canceling is awesome. NOW, the biggest issue, battery, F...ING awesome, IMO. I charged these the first day when I got them. I JUST NOW had to recharge these, 3-13-2020. Now I do not keep these in 24/7 and live with them in my ear, but for some one that would, you should be able to get a whole day easily, maybe more out of the charge. Overall these are well worth the money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,👌🏼,"You will not find a better budget wireless earphones than these. I have had these for several months and Battery life is crazy. Haven’t charged them in 2 months. Audio sounds fantastic for the price, noise cancellation is great. There’s no drivers to hear outside noise then go back cancellation. No volume controls, but for the value you can’t beat it. I highly recommend these. Plus it’s USB-C."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-13,Good for music only,Didn’t work when I received a phone call.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,Nice,For being on the cheaper side they were great quality and great sound.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,Great,A little bulky but I love that it’s waterproof!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-14,Best earbuds for the money!,Love that the ear buds are always charging while docked in the case
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-14,pretty good,"Edit:
seems to be working fine right now, hopefully it keeps doing that."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-14,"Needed new headphones, i luckily stumbled onto these ones","These are almost as good as airpods, but 75 percent less. My last pair of airpods were good but broke relatively easily and were fragile. Saw these and decided why not. You wont be disappointed . Does everything that airpods do, long battery time, and sound quality is pretty good. Happy happy happy, yeeeeeeee boiiiiii"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-14,Very pleased with purchase,Great sound quailty. Good value.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-14,Good earbuds for the money.,"Fit well, good sound quality and long batting life."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-14,Great headphones!,"Just incredible for the price. They also have wireless charging so it's great. They are actually completely waterproof, I tried them in the shower, worked perfectly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-14,Great deal,Love these. Sound is great. Can use for calls with my iPhone. Great deal!
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-03-15,Great!,"These are amazing. They sound great, I don’t have to worry about them falling out my ears. They stay nice and secure in them the whole time. Very loud and clear. I love them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-15,Would recommend,"I'm pleasantly surprised by these earbuds. They are a steal for the price. The sound it great. The controls work. The only things I have a hard time with is how noise cancelling they are, I can barely hear anything even when I'm not playing music but hey some people may like that. Also they are a little bulky but they stay in my ears really well. I would definitely recommend these to anyone."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-15,Great budget true wireless headphones,I have never owned my own true wireless headphones before these but I have tried some of my friends from Raycons to Airpods and these were by far my favorite if you could get past the bulky size.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-16,An Impressive wireless earphones,Good quality audio performance with a waterproof design for an impressive low price. Rich bass depth and no distortion at high volumes. Overall an impressive wireless earphones.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-16,Ideal for IT professionals,"I work in IT and spend the larger portion of my day on the phone or VOIP. My previous earphones were over-ear and they started hurting my ears late in the day. Movement was also limited due to the earphone wires connected to my PC. These earbuds connect easy to my PC and phone and the sound is great. After a week's usage, I have not experienced the discomfort that I had with the over-ear headphones. I gave the battery life a neutral star rating as some workdays are more busy than others and I get up to 6+ hours on a very busy day. I gave a similar rating for noise cancellation as I work from home office and little background noise. Overall, this is a great buy at the price and I highly recommend it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-16,Great sounding earbuds. USB C and Wireless Charging!,"So I used to use a Galaxy S7. And since that phone had a micro usb port, I made sure all of my accessories were also micro usb so I didn't have to carry two cables. These include my ANC headphones, earbuds, power bank and etc. Now, I just upgraded to the Galaxy S20, I felt i was time to upgrade all of my accessories. So there were 5 requirements I was looking for when I looked for my earbuds. First, of course was good sound. Second was USB C. Third was wireless qi charging. Hey. I have a phone that can power share, so that would be a convenient feature to have. Fourth was that it had to be compact and not too bulky. And lastly, it had to be affordable. After a lot of searching, you would be surprised to find a pair that met all 5 requirements. Some had USB-C, but didn't have Qi Charging. Some had Qi Charging, but only had micro usb. Some had both, but it was too bulky. If it met all 5 requirements, it was really expensive. So after balancing all the requirements out, these Earfun Earbuds seemed like the best choice. Especially since i had great reviews. And it met all 5 of my requirements. The sound - The sound is great. A little bass heavy, but I like bass. The mids were resonated and the highs were crisp. To be honest. I have tried a bunch of these budget earbuds and they have come a long way. Most of them sound pretty similar and very good. Features - It had everything I needed. USB-C. Wireless charging. Long lasting battery at 30 hours. Quick charging that give you 2 hours of listening just after 10 minutes of charging. Compact case and doesn't break the bank like the Galaxy Buds Plus. I gotta say that I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-16,Good budget earbuds,A+
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-16,Do not buy,Purchased as a Christmas gift. It is now mid-March and buds will no longer hold a charge. Do not buy.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-17,good value,"I like using these ear buds. The sound quality is pretty good, not great, but good. It is best at the mid range. If you are looking for heavy base these are not for you, but if you are looking for a good all around set of Bluetooth ear buds these wouldn't be a bad choice. For the price they would be difficult to overlook."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-17,Great value and battery life. Poor mic quality.,These things have ridiculous batter life compared to my original airpods. The sound quality is fine on my end but I gave 3 stars as part of sound quality for me is how they sound to the person on the other end . The mic on these things is bad. Not even remotely close to any other earbuds I've ever had wired or wireless. I've never had people complain they couldnt hear me until I began to use these. Just be aware if you use these for more than music that issue may arise. If the mic was good these are 5 star material without a doubt.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-18,Great Headphones,"Excellent battery life and sound quality. Charging case works very well. Connects easilly to various audio devices. Only negative is that the connection is sometimes interrupted. For example, when connected to my phone and I place the phone in my back pocket"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-18,Buyer beware,"These things are garbage. The connection is terrible. My phone will be sitting next to me on my desk or in my pocket and they constantly cut in and out with less than a few feet between them and my phone. Unacceptable imo. And it says waterproof, so I assumed that means if they get wet while wearing them they’ll continue to work. But they don’t, they just shut off. Even if fully charged they’ll just shut off. If you try to power them back up they’ll immediately shut right back off. There’s a constant static crackling sound in the right earphone. And if you wear them more than an hour or two they really start to fatigue your ears. The tips that come with then don’t provide much comfort at all. I’m pretty disappointed with this purchase to be honest."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-18,Finally a good and cheap wireless earbuds!,I go to the gym daily and this have made it really easy to move around and exercise with out any wires in the way. and other bluetooth earbuds are like 100 dollars or a lot more. so honestly this did the job!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-18,Best set of wireless buds at a very reasonable price,"I've been trying to find a good set of wireless earbuds for a few months now and out of the 5 sets I've tried these are the absolute best. Good battery life, great sound quality, ear fitament is good. I work out about an hour to two hours a day and these have been absolutely solid. The one minor critique I have is the case lid feels cheap and doesn't have any sort of support when you open it, it literally just flops around. When the case is closed there is a small magnet or something that keeps it closed so no problems there."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-18,wrathful buying,I really like the sound and its quality. It works perfectly fine for distance upto 10 m. It was really required because you can't take long office call with you phone in hand. This earbud gives you flexibility to roam around and talk with others. I really like the sound quality. I have continuously used it for 2-3 hours and it worked perfectly fine.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,Best for the money!,Great for the price. Better than I expected!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,love it- great price,exactly what I wanted. Great Price
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,"Great earbuds: ergonomic, comfortable, great sound, good battery life","I tried other wireless earbuds at this price range, and this ones outperformed the rest by a long shot. I can wear these all day long and forget i have them on. Perfect for what I needed them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,Very good sound,"The EARFUN bluetooth 5.0 wireless headphones with HD stereo sound, good bass and very clear. They are perfect for exercising with them because they are resistant to sweat, also to rain. The 500mAh charging case that can charge the headphones multiple times and can be charged with the USB-C cable (included). Includes various sizes of eartips. They are very easy to connect to your cell phone, after the first pairing and only when it is stored in the charging case, please close and re-open and re-pair it automatically. You can also use them independently."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,Excellent sound quality,"Very good headphones, excellent sound quality and battery life allow you more than 20 hours of music or phone calls."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,excellent headphone,"Compared this with Jabra 75t. It fits well, as good as the jabra. The sound quality is almost as good. only thing missing is the hear -through feature of jabra but it costs 3 times less as well, so overall excellent headphone for the price!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,These make a great gift for anyone,Excellent quality earbuds. The case is wireless charging. The earbuds are sleek design. The sound quality is superb. The packaging is great for gifting.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-19,Long battery life,So far no problems and they work and connect great. As soon as you remove them from the docking box they turn on and connect. They fit good and I have yet to use all of the battery life. Great product so far.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-20,Not good for making calls,When making a call the other person has a hard time hearing me
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-20,Great,I really love that they are wireless. No problem connecting them to my devices. Highly recommend them.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-20,Great quality product performs excellent,Great quality product. Performs excellent
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-20,Love these earbuds,"I bought these buds because of a C-Net review and thought they were a good option within my price range. I found that they have a very comfortable fit and good sound. It's not fantastic but it's good. Regarding Noise Cancellation, I don't think it has much but the fit is snug enough to block out most noise. Also, the retail box does not mention noise cancellation so I assume it has none. The battery life is great. They recharge every time you place them in the storage container so I never felt that they were likely to fail. Never used them for more than an hour at a time though. I would recommend, particularly at this price point."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-20,Pass.,"The customer support really stinks. They are outside of the US and don't actually read what you email, just scan it. They are extremely unhelpful and spam you with emails after you purchase. The volume doesn't go very high. I wouldn't recommend these, you can find better earbuds at the same price."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-20,Nice product!,"Good sound quality, pairs easily to other devices. Fit is very good and battery life is excellent. I also like the fact that I can use one bud at a time, which is sometimes useful to me. An exceptional product at the price point The only real negative is that the buds are a little slippery and thus are more difficult than expected to remove from the case. Not a serious issue."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-20,"Outstanding Quality, Noise Canceling, Battery Life and Ease of Use","I'm actually amazed by these earbuds - I've read the positive reviews and expected decent ones, but they exceeded all expectations. The sound quality and volume are impressive, the noise canceling is incredible (used it on 3+ international flights and almost couldn't hear the turbines right beside me), the battery life is amazing (on one of those flights they lasted for 7~ hours and still had some gas left), and most important of all - their shape and the way is amazing (on one flight I slept by accident for an hour, moved my head a ton and they didn't fell). Major thumbs up - amazing ""budget"" earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-20,Good customer service,"Microphone broke after a few weeks, but the company sent a replacement. Good customer service. Bluetooth connection doesn't drop and they sound nice."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-21,Perfect headphones...but...,"I was going to give these headphones a 5 star review because I love everything about them. They fit in my ear perfectly and are comfortable to wear for an hour workout or run. They don't fall out. The sound quality is great for the price and they do a great job canceling out background noise. However, after using them for about a month, they don't want to pair with my phone anymore. Or rather, one will pair and the other struggles. I hope this gets fixed because these really are stellar headphones. Easy to use, charge, and store."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-21,great quality for the price,"I use these a lot especially when i'm at the gym, i need to listen to music while i workout but the cords always get in the way so i wanted to get something wireless. they work great in my opinion, they connect to your phone via Bluetooth and pairing it is real easy. you do have to charge them but the batteries last pretty well. the sound quality is surprisingly good and it cancels out noise pretty good too. overall this is a great product and comes in a cool little case to carry around. overall i really like these and its a great product for the price, would definitely recommend!"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-21,Great customer service,"Stopped working a couple weeks into using them. However, the customer service was great and immediately reached out to me to see if I wanted a full refund or replacement pair!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-21,Good stuff,So far so good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-21,Great earbuds. Great price,These are by far the best buds I have used at this price range. Sound great. Solid build. Wireless charging capable and Usb C so i don't need to carry more than one cord
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-21,Doesn’t Work,"I am sending these back. The product description said it would connect to laptops, tablets, and phones. I had no issues when it was connected to my phone, but when it connected with my laptop, the sound was not stable and would cut out intermittently. After running several tests and reading the online troubleshooting, nothing worked. Finally, I tested a different brand of wireless headphones with my laptop, and they worked just fine. I am unhappy with the quality of these headphones and would recommend searching a different brand for better results."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-21,Surprisingly durable,"I’ve owned these over six months. They have held up well. I use them intermittently. I also have a pair of AirPods that I use. Pros:
The battery life is excellent. Much better than my first gen AirPods. The connection to my iPhone is much quicker as well. The sound quality is deep and full. They have been dropped on a number of occasions without sustaining damage. They fit well and have yet to fall out. Cons:
The charging case doesn’t fit as comfortably in my pocket as the AirPod case."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-21,Good quality for the price,Nice earphones would've liked it if you could adjust the volume on the earphones and not have to do it in the phone.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-21,Good for when not moving,Lots of background noise
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-22,Excellent for the price,"Overall, that are excellent ear buds. The fit comfortably with the multiple sizes included. My only complaint is that there is a slight delay when using them for calls with my pixel 3 phone so I end up talking over folks accidently. Other than that, the sound is very clear but for those listening to me as well as me speaking."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-22,"Great customer support, not such great product","I was not happy with the product, but their customer support was excellent. Returned product immediately, got full refund. They voluntarily sent me a bluetooth speaker, even after I said they didn't really need to do that. Pretty solid, and actually the speaker works and sounds excellent."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-22,"Great battery life, simple and reliable connectivity",Use these on bike rides. Sound quality is decent battery life about six hours. Connects well with iPhone XS. These were great for the money no regrets.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-22,Best truly wireless ear buds I've owned.,"These are the best truly wireless ear buds I've owned & I've owned about four to five different pair. These earbuds have wireless charging, volume controls on top of many other controls, ip 6 8 water & dust resistance, usb type c, very comfortable & great battery life. All for $50."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-22,Good Bluetooth earphones,"Great earphones, awesome product."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-22,Great customer service.,"They dont always connect via bluetooth to my phone or one will cut out/disconnect. The volume/power controls are very sensitive and you could be repositioning it in your ear and pause your music. However, their customer service is amazing. They were easy to work with and quick to respond."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-22,Great earphones but....,"I actually love the sound these earphones bring. Nice Bass and clarity. I totally hear nothing from the outside. Using them at work, my colleagues literally have to come and tap me to get my attention. I didn't give it 5 stars due to the fact that although I hear nothing while in ear, when placing a call I get complaints that they hear all of my background or they just cannot hear me. I looked into my cell phone settings to see if there's an option to cancel sound for call but I wasn't so lucky. If you want to purchase just for music, good sound, & battery life. I say YES! If you want hands free talk time I say No."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-22,Not Loud enough,"Not loud enough and needs just a little humph. I purchased four other earbuds within the same price points to include these manufactures (Earfun, Baspal, Comeproof, and Skullcandy) and Earfun came with the best all-round package EXCEPT the loudness."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-22,Great quality and comfortable.,These earbuds are great for leisure or active days!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-22,Your best option at an affordable price,They are made of a good material and ergonomic for any size of ears
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,Begrudgingly capitulating to wireless? Look no further! Will win over all mid-aged luddites,"I had been an apple addict since age 10 and in many ways still am -- but in my 40s kinda slowed down on keeping up with the pads, pods, watches (so dorky) as much as I still live in the apple ecosystem. I swore I'd never buy any sorta wireless earpod and honestly beats headphones are still trash (for 4 years had purchased pairs only to have them break in a few months). But, between driving more these days, trying to have relatively private hands free convos while my young daughter is around, and recently tearing my achilles ... I had to find something convenient. I was astonished at how affordable, easy to use and decent sounding these EarPods are! Why would anyone spend upwards of 100$ or more for others? Convenience -- these are super easy to set up, sync, and get started
Price -- I think these are quite simply the best at this price point 35-50$
Sound -- they are not sennheiser or bose, but given how much else you get, they sound great. The bass is legit and all else is clear enough without being tinny (I listen to mostly rock, electronic, jazz, and not a classical music snob about levels at all) ... the volume is a little lower than I prefer even when maxxed out, but perhaps thats for the better as they are indeed just loud enough -- sorta like the EarPods themselves, just really good enough. Charging -- the case really can handle 4 full charges ... which is great. The case itself also charges quickly, and I just leave mine on my cheap wireless charger pad. I also like that the case is not digital and fancy ... the basic look and feel suits my style moreso than led/digital read outs. Buttons -- I love that there is a tactile button that you can actually feel depress. Others where you just tap always leave me pressing the wrong number of times. You get used to the Taps and holds for volume, skipping tracks and calls ... it kinda becomes intuitive after a few days. Siri - works perfectly ... really kinda amazing, especially if you have any sorta smart devices in your home. The cast I have on is making this aspect even more convenient but being able to turn on lights, thermostats, Apple TVs with these pods is awesome. I can sea myself possibly in the future wanting something with a bit more audio oomph down the road, but I've also read that many people end up using these as spares -- for their office, car etc.
Couple of other notes -- you cant sync them to multiple devices ... but its easy enough to disconnect them. I tried them with my Apple TV (for late night movie viewing) and they were solid. There is another option on Amazon (vankyo) that also appear highly rated, but they were out of stock and I dont really like those glowing buds or that readout on the case. And for those new to the pods, just be sure you kinda keep the case in a convenient location as they kinda act like the home base for these things. Otherwise you'll lose them, or the kids/dog etc will definitely let curiosity get the better of them. Highly recommended for first time pod newbies, spares, and those looking for best budget options."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,Buena inversión,"Tiene un audio bueno, no es excelente pero si tiene un buen micrófono para las llamadas como sistema para manos libres funciona bastante bien."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-23,"Great for music/books, TERRIBLE for phone calls","There was a lot to like about these earbuds but I had to go for an average of 3.
5s for comfortable, stays in place really well, good noise-cancelling, clear sound for my audio books, great charging case, easy pairing, reasonable price. I really wanted to like them! BUT here's the 1 rating. I absolutely could not use them for phone calls! I could hear the other person just fine, but in every they could not hear me. The noise cancelling effect muffled the sound of my own voice, so I was never sure if I was talking too loudly, but I could have gotten used to that. However, not one call could be completed without having to remove the ear bud and turn off Bluetooth so the other person could hear me. This was a make or break for me. Back they went. Too bad."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,great range!,"i just got these yesterday but already loving how easy they are to use! I use them primarily for phone conversations while i am walking around putting away laundry or something, and they work great! I even went into a totally different room and could still hear my friend. Sound quality was good for music, too. I guess they are sound cancelling so it sounds a bit strange to hear myself talk due to that, but i think that's to be expected. Overall i am really happy with these. They are also comfortable which is nice, as some ear buds can really bother me. It's nice to have my hands free and not worry about carrying my phone around with me while i do chores and chat."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,Love these,Battery life is awesome !! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,Easy for even a newbie to figure out.,"I'm a newbie at wireless headphones, although I've researched them a ton, and over the years bought my husband 3 pair, and daughter 2 now. So I've used each pair long enough to know what good sounds like. I'm so impressed with these. They fit well, sound great. Easy to use. My husband wants to switch. Nah Fam! Lol
They are a bit awkward getting in and out of the case and my ears, but I think I will probably have to just get accustomed to that, not like theres anything wrong with the product. All in all, I definitely recommend!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,Cheaper than others and voice quality is,"I started gym and love to hear music when workout so bought these with larest technology, these earbuds are latest model, price was very cheaper than others and voice quality is good , they fit in ears easily , charging cpacity is great"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-23,Worth every penny,Really good earbuds for the price. Probably the best ones I have owned so far. The battery life is great and noise cancellation is awesome. I couldn't hear the person standing next to me. It was that effective. Worth every penny of it.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-23,Great. Mic sucks!,"Overall very solid for the price. The sound and fit were great. The controls are fairly easy to use. The two issues I had with these and were my primary reasons for returning them were as follows:
1. The mic was annoying an it cut in and out. I take work calls throughout the day and I want to be heard. People said I sounded far away and that my volume would constantly come in and out. I repeated myself constantly. I verified this via talking a voice memo. 2. The controls are press buttons on the side that sometimes feel pretty uncomfortable due to the force you need to use and the times you need to push. Advancing a track is three presses. Not taps. So the unit kinda feels uncomfortable when you have to do that. Overall the sound and the units were fine. Just wanted a top notch mic ability (are there any besides AirPods) which this far I can only get in my AirPods. Which have their own longevity issues. Ugh"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-23,Can be better,"Its big but they not fall that easy from ears, is no noice cancelling technology in it, and the worst thing one of them start working bad not even a week of use them"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-24,Only reliable for 3 months time :0(,Stopped pairing and would not hold the charge only after 3 months. Window to return the product has closed on Amazon. Very disappointed because I was very happy with the sound and the product until it began to malfunction after such a short period of time :0(
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-24,First impression looks good.,"Initial impressions:
Pairing was painless and earbuds could be paired to both laptop and phone with no difficulty. Initial sync and sound quality seems good. USB charging is always a plus. Build quality of the case and impressions of the earbuds may leave something to be desired. Battery life and general quality review will be updated with use. Continued use:
In this time of constant conference calls these have gotten a good workout in just a couple days. Decent sound quality and connectivity through and through. It would be nice if there was a way to charge them wirelessly, or while in use, but that seems not to be the case. The instructions are definitely a bit confusing on wireless charging (it shows not included, but that isn't clear if it's referring to the charging mat or the capability)."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-24,"Waterproof is real, great for MTB riding","So, its been a month since I have them and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase. They are as advertised. I am very happy with sound quality and consistency altogether. My only issue since I have these is that sometimes one of the buds wont turn on or connect to my phone, but what I found to do is to put them back in the case and close it for a second or so and they come back to life right away and after that, they work fine. I use them mostly for outdoor MTB riding so they are exposed to a lot of sweat and dust, they have even fell to the ground a few times and they keep working fine, I just dust'em off and keep on going. It took me some time to get used to the rubber fittings since, I honestly don't like that feeling of vacuum inside the ear, in my case I feel like I am listening through a stethoscope but what I did is use the smaller ones provided so they don't lock on as hard inside, they fit comfortably and don't fall off easy. Battery life is great and I love the fact that the case keeps them charged. The only thing is that the battery indicator on the case is not very accurate, I charge the case as soon as I see only two dots of four. Because if the case dies the buds don't work at all and that's a bummer if you are about to go out riding. Lastly, the noise canceling is most due to the way the lock inside the ear but I can say that when you are flying they are very good for watching a movie and isolating yourself from the crying child on the seat behind you. Not as good as my AKG N series of course, those are proper traveling headphones but they do a fine job. In general, I am very happy, coming from wired earbuds for reliability and comfort when I exercise I can say these changed my mind about Bluetooth earbuds. I enjoy them very much."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-24,Great Wireless Earbuds,"After starting to work from home for a bit, I couldn't just play loud music on my laptop / phone because it would disturb my family. I purchased these wireless earbuds for that fact of just having a set of bluetooth earbuds that would let me be mobile around the house and just listen to music while working. They were easy to setup, good sound quality, and the range is pretty good as well. I was able to go into a completely different room and left my phone in the original and the music stayed connected with no disruptions. Good wireless earbuds at a good price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-24,Worth the price!,"Everything seems good about this product. Fits well in the ear. Clear sound
Although one change I would like is maybe get a rubber grip or something on the earbuds so it’s easier to take it out of the case (a personal preference)"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-24,Very good headphones and great customer service,"Getting a good review out of me is difficult. I'm very skeptical of Amazon ratings and the things companies do to artificially boost ratings. I've skewered several companies for their fraudulent products and ratings games. First, the headphones: They're very good. I like the USB-C charging since that's what I use elsewhere. Bluetooth connections are fast and reliable. Battery life is good. The only thing I don't like is that they're a bit bulky and I have a very hard time getting them under a swim cap... Enough trouble that I stopped trying to use them this way. Even better, though, was customer service. One of the earbuds stopped working. After some quick and reasonable suggestions from customer service, they agreed to send a new pair. I received them quickly and they've been great about followup up on satisfaction. And, more importantly, they never asked or even implied that I should leave a review. They seem to really care about customer satisfaction."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-24,Great sound for the money,This replaced a set of sennheisers wired buds and they sound great. One of the buds did become defective but a replacement by the manufacturer was sent out immediately. battery life is great. love the wireless charging.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-25,Failed after a month,Worked well for a month and a half. Now the volume is way down on the left bud.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-25,EarFun Wireless Earbuds,I was anxiously waiting for my EarFun wireless earbuds to charge because I couldn't wait to try them. They are easy to setup and the clarity is fantastic! They are a perfect fit. I would recommend them and they would make a great gift for anyone.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-25,Sound is good,Great sounding ear buds. Purchase these for my son. He loves them.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-25,Best wireless waterproof dustproof headphones you can get for $50. (Really $100+ quality wise),I was kinda sceptical at first being an off brand and being a little cheaper than most good wireless waterproof headphones but I got to say I am a lead hvac installer and I'm in 120+ degree attics most of the summer and I sweat alot and I can honestly say these are good tips rating and fit and hold amazing battery life holds good quick charge is convenient I will definitely be a repeat customer for these headphones and would highly recommend to anyone. Best wireless waterproof dustproof headphones your $50 can buy. A+ Ear fun.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-25,great sound at a great price,"The sound quality of the earfun earbuds is on par with earbuds that cost much higher. It even offers wireless charging which I feel is a big plus for a phone in this price range. as the design of the earbuds is an in-ear design it offers noise-cancelling effects too. The box for the earbuds is compact and closes easily. The earbuds have a great, sleek design. the case holds charging for 24 hours which is a huge plus. if you are looking for a great pair of wireless earbuds for a fair price, I would strongly recommend this."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-25,"Great product, just be careful using in water","I love these earphones. They fit really good and don't come off when I run. The sound quality and everything else is really good too. The only problem I had was that the first time I got it, one of the earphones stopped charging. But I think it's because I used it in the shower (product says you can use in water but I don't think it's waterproof). Either way, their customer support is amazing because they immediately sent me a new pair. Waterproof isn't a big deal for me so I just don't use it in the shower anymore. Overall, love it!"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-25,Great value,Simple and easy to use. Great value for the price. Syncs effortlessly with my multiple devices.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-25,Constantly cutting out,"These are great when they work. Which is only sometimes. All other times, audio cuts out or goes robotic or delays and then speeds up to try to catch up with whatever I'm watching. The signal cuts out whenever I turn my head despite a clear line of sight to the Bluetooth adapter plugged into my computer, less than two feet away. I've updated drivers; un-paired and re-paired; modified my router's 2.4 GHz WiFi signal strength; permanently unpaired these from my phone. Yet still, I cannot get a consistent sound nor signal from these earbuds. At least I can use them as expensive ear plugs, I guess. They're great at blocking out the office noises I deal with at work."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-26,Can you keep them in our ear?,You might have to buy a knit hat to keep them in your ears if you are active.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-26,Calidad/ precio,"Se sienten un poco incomodos, muy grandes para mi oreja"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-26,Does work as advertised,"I must say the customer service at earfun is impeccable. I had a problem with the first pair, just a defective item. I returned and them and gave them a bad review. Earfuns’s customer service contacted me based on my bad review and asked for a second chance. I agreed and must say that I am happy with the sound of these buds. A pretty much flat response but the bass is definitely present. I’m a little surprised because a lower priced bud normally sounds to high without lows. I have to give them five stars but this is based on a PUSH BUTTON TYPE earbud. The touchscreen type bud is too sensitive to any kind of accidental touch whereas this is not a problem for the earfun buds. I also like the type C charging cable and the smaller case. The case is not so small one can’t get the buds out like some other brands but a great size with plenty of room for your fingers to gain purchase. This product does work as advertised and I would recommend them to a friend."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-26,Would not buy again,"Battery life was horrible and connection was poor, would not recommend"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-26,"Believe the ratings on these ear buds, they are excellent value.",Listen to music and pod casts all day with these. Truly impressed with product for this price point.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-26,Just what I needed for running.,"Sound is very nice! I took them for a run and I like tbat the outside noise is muffled but not fully cancelled, as I like to stay aware of outside noise while running. Music sound is superb."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-27,These are quiet. I want a little loud,"Battery life is awesome

Volume is horrible"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-03-27,Sound Quality,The sound is very unclear.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-28,Crispy and clear sound,Espectacular Quality sound. Good product for the price that i paid.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-28,"Great sound and fantastic customer service, but uncomfortable and bad microphone","Bought these to facilitate working from home since I'm on the phone all day. The sound cancellation and sound quality are excellent, but the earbuds are painful to wear for any extended period of time and the microphone leaves a lot to be desired. Most of my clients have trouble hearing me unless I'm speaking loudly enough to disturb my neighbors. Update: added 2 stars for stellar customer service. The company reached out to me to offer a potential solution in the form of a different product. Looking into that now. Star added for good customer service with enough attention to detail to spell my name correctly."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-28,Ok product.,Ear buds are really decent for the price. However the left ear bud has some issues with treble. It sounds like it’s blown at certain times. Overall seems like a good purchase with the exception of the sound on the left bud.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-28,decent quality,"Nicely packed although packing is not the most convenient one to open. Feels well-made. Instructions are clear. Easy to pair. Decent sound quality although you cannot expect Beats quality ( I have PowerBeats 3). These ones lack good bass. So far, I did 1 session of exercise. Walk/run up to 7.5 mph. In 45 min session, one earbud fell off 3 times, and I found myself pushing it in few times to stop it from falling. The other earbud stayed in throughout. Controls are easy. However, I accidentally turned it off a couple of times while I was adjusting it in my ear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-28,You won't regret trying these earbuds.,"After using these for a few weeks I decided to submit a review. So far, these ear buds have worked great. I use them at work in a noisy environment. There is plenty of volume and good sound quality. The controls are simple and easy to use. Battery life has been great. The buds have yet to die on me but I don't use them non stop. I've only had to charge the case about once a week to my surprise. I bought these to see if I would like this style of earbud compared to my wireless neck band style. There was an adjustment period of a few days but i am glad I gave these a shot. If someone wants to try a quality set of this style earbud with a minimal investment, I would recommend this brand/ model."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-28,Wanted to like them so badly,"Edit: these may work great if you have only one device you want to use them with. The biggest problem is that is if I pair it to a device, another device can't even find it. For example, I paired it with my iPad. The iPad is turned off but when I try to use them with my phone, but phone can't even find them. I have to then go to my iPad and unpair them. Very frustrating for someone who is used to switching between multiple devices. Original post:
I tried. The price was great. The size, fit, and sound quality were good. But mic and connection issues were too much. There are frequent split-second disconnections in one or both ears. When using for phone calls, people say they can't hear me well. The volume is just adequate. I used them on a flight and at max volume, it worked for watching a movie. They didn't automatically reconnect to devices that I have paired them with, requiring me to constantly pair them manually when I switched between my phone, ipad, TV, etc. And when I would get out of my car, they wouldn't pick up my phone. If the mic sound worked better, I might have kept these, even with the frequent connection problems. The noise cancelling was very good. The sound quality for the price was surprisingly good."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-28,GREAT BASS!,Has great bass for a wireless earbud! Sound sometimes goes in and out but still great sound for the price. The sound goes in and out when moving especially when moving mouth like eating or drinking.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-28,best sound quality,sounds quality is best and battery last longer than other buds. highly recommended
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-29,"""Beware"" Goes out of sync",3stars because These earbuds sound pretty good for the price. But goes out of sync while watching videos. This is my second pair and it does the same thing. I like to edit music videos with earbuds but can't use these at all. I wouldn't recommend these if you use them for anything other than listening to music.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-29,Nice Feel and Good Sound,"These ear buds are perfect for your tablets, computers or phones. Pairing is easy and the charging case allow you to go days without having to plug your earbuds into power. Perfect for traveling. The sound is crisp and the base is pleasantly deep. The ear buds come with different size plugs for a fit for just about every ear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-29,Good product. Great customer service.,"Very solid product. Performs way above the price point. Had an issue where one bud stopped charging after 6 months but customer service was excellent: they responded promptly, were real humans, and replaced the product"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-30,Great value. Great product.,This product was used to replace my airpods and they did not disappoint. The sound quality and the features were superior to my airpods.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-30,Very Nice Sound and Portability,Sounds great. I also like the battery supply in the case so that you can recharge without a plug.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-30,Best connectivity,"one of the best earbuds, the long range connectivity is a strength, noise cancellation, feels like a disco in your head. I can leave my phone in the locker at the gym and still be connected while on the treadmill."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-31,Great buds for a great price!,I like these earbuds! They stay in great and have great sound! I love that it connects to whichever device I’m using .. haven’t tested the waterproofing but it’s great to have that function! Very happy with them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-31,Wow,For the price you can’t beat them. They are extremely comfortable. Sound quality is excellent! Bass is a little lacking but these are crystal clear on the highest volume setting. Oh and I never expected them to be wireless charging compatible so huge bonus there. These things are truly a steal at $49. Couldn’t be happier. I only bought them for use on my flight for vacation and I’m seriously surprised how excellent they are.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-31,"Worked for 3 months, then stopped","These worked fine for 3 months, but now cut in and out, and sometimes just stop working altogether. We keep resetting them, and then they work for a short while, then stop working again. Of course we are outside the return window now. I wouldn't recommend."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-31,Sound quality,"They are a really good earbuds, the have a perfect sound, I had phone calls and listened to music with the and the sound quality it’s awesome! They are also so confortable to wear, they stay in your ear without bothering and doesn’t hurt at all 🤗"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-31,Worked right out of the box!,"These worked great as soon as they arrived. I haven’t fully tested the battery life yet, but they did charge up quickly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,One of the best for the price,"I've had these for 6 months, and CNET was right. The 2020 version adds a volume control feature and some other improvements, which really put this product over the top for the price. I almost wish I had waited for the update because I have to use the device for volume control. Anyway, the sound quality really is great, but these are the first ones I've ever owned. I put them far above my wired headphones that came with my old iPhone. The bass is really good on these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Quality Earphones !!,"Overall sound is better than most true wireless earbuds I've tried. And finally I was able to connect an ear buds to my LG device which would never allow any other buds to be connected. Heavy bass but not very crisp. Phone calls are decent, though listening to the music is great. Neat and ergonomic fit, which is great plus, unlike some that keep falling off, this one stays in place. Battery life is as advertised. Overall a great ear phones for the price ! !"
EarFun,Free,1,0,2020-04-01,They only lasted a month,The day after the return was no longer available one year but would not turn on and the other one will not stay charged and now I'm stuck with them
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Great value!,These buds provide very good overall sound quality. Their noise cancellation is very good and I especially like the fact I do not here wind when I am using them outside.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Finally USB C,"Finally a pair with USB C port. Sounds good, mic quality is good not great. But for the budget earbuds this is really good"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Great earbuds.,"I love them, all the earbuds I had in the pass tend to fall off my ear while I'm running. This one doesn't. The fit perfectly and the sound is amazing."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-01,Not quite the earbuds I thought these were,"Okay, these are not as good as I thought they were. New problems arose. The left earbud now keeps going out."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Great earbuds- pleasantly surprised!!,"I read a review about these earbuds as being a lower priced but highly rated review via a tech website. I must say I am very impressed with the sound quality. They stay in my ears, sound is awesome, love the charger box. Highly recommended."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-01,Love the noise cancellation,"It fits in my ear nicely and I often can't feel they are in. The ear bud fits in and is small. It's a little short and as a result it feels like it's going to fall out sometimes. The noise cancellation is the best I've experienced in any ear buds. I can't hear my husband or kids or phone, while in the same room. My own little getaway."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,It was a good purchase!,Love these... just be aware that they really do cancel out the sounds around you...
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-04-01,"Well, well!","These are the best Bluetooth buds I have bought. A great set of earphones that couldn't be simpler to connect and use. I use them for the gym, I can do every exercise without any fear they will fall off."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-02,"Good for listening, not talking","First few calls people said it wasn't the best but was clear and loud enough to talk on. After that, people seem to have a hard time hearing. They say the sound is in and out. That's with me and the phone sitting still, quiet room, just a few feet away. As for listening, they seem to work pretty well. Decent sound. Extra ear pads like most come with now."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-02,Really Great Earbuds,Great sound. Great play time. Easy to set up. I really like them.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-02,Great pair of wireless earbuds!,"I currently use the Galaxy Buds for my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra phone, but wanted to have another pair of earbuds so I could use them at work and leave the other ones at home. I am very impressed with these Earfun earbuds because they worked seamlessly, and out of the box they were easy to pair. For the price they have great sound and bass, really comparable to the more expensive brands. I use them while working at my desk but they have good range and keep connected if I need to go around the office and warehouse leaving my phone on the desk. They are very comfortable. I just changed the silicone tips for the smallest size (included) and now they fit securely. Overall, they are great earbuds for a good price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-02,Been using these a lot while trapped at home,"Got these last week, I like both the size of the buds and the case (fits easily in the pocket). Pairs quickly with my Motorola phone every time I've pulled them out of the case. Battery life lasts the whole workday. Sound quality is very good for the price, some others I've tried are a little tinny."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-04-02,Airpods but a fraction of the price,These are just as functional as apple- but a fraction of the price. I love how you can connect the earbuds either separately or together- letting you charge one while using the other. Charging case is very convenient.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-02,Fantastic Quality - Especially for the Price!,Since receiving these almost a month ago they have been fabulous. They're a bit larger than I expected and kind of stick out from my ears but they stay in place which is what matters. Sound quality is also pretty dang good for being less than $100! I would highly recommend! ** With moderate use I have yet to need to charge the case since the initial charge upon unboxing
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-02,Battery life was 3-4 hours.,"Compare to apple EarPods. it is a good deal. I can’t complain, the battery life was around 3-4 hours. I used iPhone to pairing with it, no problem. The style is almost as other brand."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-03,STOPPED WORKING WITHIN A MONTH,"I really liked these. I only charged them once and the battery never drain but after a moth, the right earphone stopped working. It doesn't charge when in the case. The left one still working normal but why do I want one only? Don't waste your money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-03,Great sound quality!,They work great! I’ve lost them twice already and still can’t find the left earbud but that’s probably a personal issue more than anything.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-03,"Great for listening, not for phone calls.",I mostly got these as a more affordable alternative to other ear bud products out there because they were suggested to me on cnet. I love how they easily pair with my phone. Love that I can use either one of them individually. I have used them daily for over a week and still haven't even had to charge the case yet. Can't speak to their waterproof qualities or noise cancellation. (I didn't realize they were supposed to be noise canceling) Four stars instead of five because I did try using them for phone calls a couple of times and had to stop using them because the person on the other line said they couldn't hear me so I won't be using them for that personally. Other than that they are great for music and podcasts while riding my bike or working in my shop.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-03,BEST QUALITY HEADPHONE UNDER $50.,I really like the way it fit and how comfortable it feels in my ear. The noise canceling part of it is awesome. But I prefer to run with one earbud in so I can still monitor my surroundings. And yes the quality of sound in wearing one earbud in is just as great. .
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-03,A good low cost alternative,Good for a second set. Rather than spend another 200 for an apple brand earbud. This one is almost as good at a much lower price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-03,Sound great once positioned right.,This is my third set of Bluetooth headphones and they slot in the middle of my collection. I'll be comparing the EarFun buds to my LG Tone HBS760 and JBL 150NC. These are my first bud style Bluetooth headphones and I was impressed with the quality of the earbuds as well as the charging case it comes with. I appreciate that they are have the new USB-C and that they have wireless charging in care the port ever dies. Battery life so far has been 4+ hours of use and I will update if that changes too soon. Sound quality is very good once you position the earbuds correctly. My main issue is it took me some time to figure out best placement in my ear. Sound quality suffers if positioned incorrectly but that is more user error. I think these are worth it for the price. Sometimes there is a coupon to make it a better deal.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-04,Ok product,"Worked good for a bit but started malfunctioning after a couple workouts, one earbud cuts in and out"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-04,Battery life is short.,I was very happy with these buds. I got them November 7th and started using them right away. They die after 3 minutes of use now. They lasted about 5 months.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-05,Best Purchase of the Year,"I wear these while biking, walking, and mowing the lawn. They cancel the noise perfectly. They fit my ear snuggly, but not too tight that they are painful. The four size options make it easy to switch the size if the pre-installed ones don't fit your ear the best. I tried them all and then ended up using the ones that came pre-installed anyway. The battery lasts way longer than I will ever need. I have had them for over a week and haven't had to charge the case yet. It still has over 75% battery. The earbuds themselves charge from the case, so I don't have to worry about them dying while I'm out and about. My only complaint is that you actually have to push the buttons instead of being able to tap them lightly. But for the price, you can't beat these earbuds."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-05,Good earbuds with some flaws that could be a dealbreaker for some,"I've been using these for a bit now and wanted to leave up an honest review about these, since there's some specifics about them that will make me honestly start looking at alternatives. Let me get the negatives out of the way since I imagine many might wonder why the 3 star review as opposed to the many 5 star ones that are being handed out like candy. So far my negatives are:
- Buttons are uncomfortable to press, as you basically end up pushing the earbuds further into your ear
- Can't change what the buttons actually do. I'm not a fan that it's 3 button presses to go next or back
- Sometimes the buttons aren't reliable when pressing them. I've tried skipping tracks but end up either pausing the track, or lowering/raising the volume
With these negatives I've often just avoided using the buttons at all at this point, and just bring out my phone to change tracks or raise the volume. Positives:
+ Ear buds fit fine. Just make sure you find the right tips
+ Sound is very good, much better than I expected and my expectations were extremely low. I'm not an audiophile so I can't speak on anything like lows, mids, bass, etc. but I've personally bought many earbuds recommended by audiophiles and these are pretty close to sound quality as those I've bought
+ Latency for videos is basically non-existent, but I am using a Galaxy S8+ with bluetooth 5.0 so your results may be different if you're using an older device with a lower bluetooth version. Gaming wise there is definitely some latency, like a 1-2 second delay. I can't speak on the battery life since I'm often not using them for long periods of time. I intended to use these on some long flights I had been taking, but due to events going on I haven't been able to test them out. I also haven't personally used them for any phone calls so I can't speak about the call quality either. Would I still recommend them in the end? I would say yes, but only if you're OK with not using the physical buttons on these things due to the negatives above. If you do want a pair of wireless earbuds that will let you put your phone aside and you can easily use the earbuds to answer calls or skip tracks, you'll probably want to look for some earbuds that don't have physical buttons."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-05,Amazing Product,"The sound quality is amazing, good base. The quality of the case and the ear plugs is also very good. I like the product with this price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-05,An experience..,"They adapt nicely to your ears, I’ve tried other and they usually fall off at some point or angle. You guys want to try, clear sound and tried them in the shower and tub, they do the waterproof job pretty well. So far so good"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-05,Very good earbuds it works perfectly,Very good earbuds it works perfectly
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-05,Great earbuds set,"Great earbuds, amazing sound quality, light weight, soft feel and great fit. I like them. USB c and wireless charging; charges real quick. It is every easy to set up and use. No regrets so far"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-05,Good idea doesn't work,"Volume is ok, sound quality is ok but people can not hear you on well on calls, and has a very short Bluetooth range. Have not been able to stay on a phonecall using this device."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-06,I wanted to love it but ...,"I ordered this earbud on November last year. I use it 4-6hrs/day everyday to listen to my recorded lectures, it has been working fine until now. After 5 month the connection signal would drop every hour now and then. And now, it drops every haft an hour or 15 minutes. It gets to the point of dropping too often that i rather to wear the old school wire headset. Sadly it goes to trash soon although i did love it"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Best headphones for the price,"These headphones have everything, wireless charging, great sound, and low latency. I use them for my phone and laptop and they always connect very fast and stay connected. I think these have the most features for the money. I have a few other pairs from amazon around the same price point and these just sound and work better."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Gift for my wife - she is happy,"I bought these for my wife, she has used them for about 10 days. no issues so far and she is happy with them. I read an article online that said these were basically the best bang for your buck with wireless buds. I do think its nice that you only have to charge the base, and then the base charges the earbuds 4-5 times on its own charge."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-06,Appreciate the company!,"Update: After I left my past review, I was contacted by the company and they offered to replace what they felt were a defective pair of the headphones. All I had to do was say yes and a few days later I received a new pair. It appears that they’ve updated their headphones so you can now listen to just one earbud at a time and they don’t unpair like mine were. So far my experience has been great with the new pair. There have been a couple of times where the sound cuts out but it’s only for a second and has only happened a couple of times. Other than that I’ve been really happy with the sound quality and the updated pair seem to have better noise cancelling features. I also really appreciate that the company reached out to correct the issue promptly. This seems like a company that supports and follows up with their customers and I will definitely come back to them if I ever need another pair. Thanks! Old review: I’ve had nothing but problems since I bought these. They are constantly unpairing from my phone and now even though the charging case says it’s fully charged, the headphones themselves say battery low after like 30 minutes. Today I got a battery low message so I put them in the charging case for 6 hours and after using them for 10 minutes they said battery low then a few minutes later the battery died. I realize they are a more affordable option but I would say just spend the extra to get better ones cause now I have to spend extra on top of these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Overall great!,To my surprise this was made really well! Charging case is made of cheap plastic but the earbuds sound and feel amazing and for me that is all that matters.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Wireless bluetooth,"Yes, the style is very like, the sound quality is good and easy to carry."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Nice earbuds with QI charging,"These are very well packed and overall nicely designed. I like that they went with a type C cable to charge them. Other earbuds I have used have gone with micro USB and that is definitely getting annoying to keep an extra cable on me. I really like the ability to charge these with the QI charger I have. That makes it convenient to charge at not android users houses. The sound quality is nice and honestly they are extremely easy to pair. Using them as a pair or as just one is easy. After pairing with your phone you can simply put the one you aren't using in the case. When you want to switch back to two you take is out and you will hear powering on and the sound will sync. The one downside I have found with earbuds in this price range is they don't offer the ability to sense when it's removed from your ear. This means when you want the earbud to turn off you'll need to put it in the case. The manual does a good job of explaining what tapping the side will do and you can also power them on and off holding down the side of it. Overall:
These are great set of earbuds and are being used as my daily pair at the moment. I will update this review if I have any issues."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,I love my earbuds,"I’ve been looking for a good quality but also not crazy expensive earbuds for a long time, trying to compare reviews with specifications etc. Finally I decided to get these ones and I don’t even regret it a bit. First it came in a really nice box, second my ears are a little bit small which makes complicated for me to keep headphones in their place but this earbuds comes with different sizes and they feel so comfortable and three the charging box is really cool and as soon as I take them out of there, they connect to my cellphone (really fast which impress me). I really recommend this ones."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Unbelievable price. Amazing headphones.,Excellent battery life. Terrific sound. The best thing is the device automatically connects to laptop and cellphone at the same time. The device senses the active connection and picks up the correct source.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,P,Everything
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Awsome sound quality!!,overall a good wireless headphone for an affordable price. I like the quality and it is much better than my expensive buds from a reputable company. I like it a lot.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,The design is very reasonable,It is also comfortable and pain-free throughout the day and is designed to fit the ear completely and safely
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-07,"Worked fine, then died","Update: While they don't smoothly pair with devices, they do eventually work. When working they fit well and sound is OK. Can't expect great sound for $50. But after working for 6 months they fail to charge. They are at 35% now so I expect after the next time, they will die and be useless. I believe the buds themselves are fine, its the case that charges has failed. Can't charge, can't use."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,Well made.,My son and I love it.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,"Comfortable, clear, no problems!","I purchase quite a bit of these earbuds for multiple family members. These were really on par with every other ones I purchased. They're very comfortable, those that aren't used to having earbuds in their ears may require some time to get used to it. The microphone is pretty clear and the volume itself is great! Battery life isn't a problem as the case charging the earbuds. I leave my cases charging every night before bed anyways. Earbuds are comfortable. The microphone is loud and clear. No charging problems. What more can you ask for?"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,Amazing. Can use one while the other charges.,"The sound quality and range are amazing. I normally use one and charge the other. They also charge with my wireless charger for my iPhone, and were easy to set up."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-07,👍🏽,👍🏽
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-07,Save up for something decent.,This product worked fine for the first month. After that the right ear pod does not charge and only lasts for 3 minutes. The ear pods does not disconnect from your phone while they charge so you must manually disconnect them from Bluetooth. Please don’t make the same mistake as I did. Save up for something decent.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,Excellent customer service,Had a slight issue and they made it right quickly. Excellent customer service happy with the product
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-07,stop charging,it’s my first time to have a wireless earbuds and yes i totally read most of the reviews. But sadly after a 1 1/2 month of use the other piece stop charging. I don’t even use it frequently. Now it’s just there on my drawer i regret buying this product. quality of sound and battery life is good but for that short period it stop charging.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-07,Worth the investment,"I purchase as a last minute item since I lost my Jabra Elites on a flight from Spain, needless to say I was hesitant on purchasing something under $100, but I must say it is worth and I have been using them on all my iOS and Windows devices, granted unpairing and pairing between 5 devices is crazy but I enjoy the sound and the quality is very good so far!! I will recommend if you want to enjoy good sound from music, video, and calls. I must warn you the range starts to fall apart after 15 feet."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,YOU CAN CONTROL VOLUME WITH DOUBLE TAP,"Only writing a review to spread the word: if you double tap on the left earbud -> volume down; if you double tap on the right earbud -> volume up. I don't know if this is a 2020 update thing or what, but apparently no one knows this in the Amazon reviews. Even says so in the instruction manual (yes, I read instruction manuals, bite me). Oh and they sound pretty good. I also like the noise isolation they provide. Better than my previous neck buds. Would recommend. ...................................................................................
DOUBLE CLICK TO CHANGE VOLUME LEVEL
..................................................................................."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,Features are great,"Silicone support ring, lightweight design, comfortable all day. High-quality sound quality, affordable price. A good design is the ability to choose which headphones to listen to. Or you can charge while listening. The slim charging case slips easily into your pocket, although it can sometimes be too slippery, so be careful. It can be controlled at the touch of a button, and the battery life can be checked through a mobile phone or other connected device, which is very good."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-07,"Love the sound, easy to use, but microphone is weak","These sound great, are easy to use, and reliable. They would merit five stars if used solely as headphones. But the microphone is weak, rendering them pretty much unusable for phone calls, unfortunately."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,I genuinely really love this product,"the earbuds received, the trial feels good, the pairing is , the operation is convenient, the sound quality is very good, it is really genuine, value for money, the overall appearance is beautifully packaged, the appearance is sleek and simple, listening to the song without noise is relatively clear, the size is just right , comfortable to wear, and the logistics is super .These are undoubtedly the best headphones I have ever had."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-08,Disappointed with Longevity,Headphones intermittently cut in and out after a month of use. Seems like earbuds are blown out like Farrah Abraham's genitals.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Best Earbuds (and I've tried A LOT),"What make these the best buds I've tried:
- Good audio quality. Usually people can't hear me when using ear buds but with these the calls are smooth and clear. - Quick connection. They automatically pair as you take them out of the case so you're ready to go as soon as you pop them in. No wasting precious seconds turning them on. - USB-C. Woot. - Customer service. My first pair ran into an issue where the case stopped charging so the buds in turn could not be charged. However, it was within the warranty period and I got a hold of someone at EarFun quickly and they replaced the pair. There was some back and forth, though it's understandable that they want to make sure you did some troubleshooting before asking for a replacement. - Love these and will continue to buy this brand when I inevitably lose this pair or it dies out."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Love it so much!,"They're also VERY comfortable and sit well in your ear. The sound isolation is good too - will be great for the gym, running or just watching a movie. Buy these - you'll be happy you did - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Great Earbuds for the price,"Due to the current situation, I needed some effective earbuds and these worked perfectly. It fits all ear sizes (I have small ears compared to my husband who has big ear holes) and both of us were able to use it comfortably. Easy to install and use. So far, I've used it since I purchased and haven't had to charge it yet."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-08,"Okay Sound, Very Poor Phone Call Quality",They just arrived today. Pros: Arrived quickly and fully charged. Easy setup. Cons: Average sound and VERY MUFFLED CALL QUALITY after testing with my roommate and asking how I sounded on her end. I make a lot of phone calls for work so this is unacceptable and I am more than likely going to return.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Very good Bluetooth headset worth having,"For my love of music, this Bluetooth headset is really great. I have bought other Bluetooth headsets before. The overall feeling is not as good as this product. The pairing is simple. The sound is very loud and the sound quality is very good. The sound is also very clear when answering the phone. The battery is durable."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-08,I take it on the walk with me all the time..,"The sound quality is really impressive for price of these things. They have great bass response, clean mids, and crisp highs. I love that there is no wire between them or piece that you have to wear around your neck. They are also very light weight and can be twisted around a bit to get a perfect fit in your ear. The connection range on these is awesome. Way better than my other headphones. I left my phone in the kitchen then walked into the bathroom of the bedroom at the opposite end of the house with no interruption; a good 40+ feet with multiple walls in between. I love also that they come with a portable charger. I haven't used them continuously enough to test the 4 hours per charge, or the 14 hours of playtime with the portable charger case, but since I haven't had to recharge the case since I received them a week ago, and I use them every night while doing the dishes and cleaning up for the end of the day. The connectivity with the phone is super easy to manage, simply put them in the case when your done, and your phone disconnects from them, take them out of the case, and your phone reconnects. Quick and easy. They also include some functions like play/pause, or skip/replay with light taps on the ear buds (also can be used for answering calls or talking to siri, but I don't use them for that). Really happy with this purchase overall, and will be buying another pair for my husband to take on his walks."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-08,Well worth the money,"I found myself not using my Bose headphone after buying these life rockers. Definitely makes my traveling a little bit easier since the size is small so I can put it any where even in my pockets. I bought other pairs from other companies too. Since the price is so much more affordable comparing to most brand names like Bose and Apple, I’m able to try several brands. This little guy is a great investment. Sound quality is very good. Noise canceling is not as good as my Bose, but with the price, it’s worth it. The plus is it’s water proof. I have never had the opportunity to test the water proof quality so I can only take their words for it. It doesn’t rain here in AZ LOL."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Not good for phone calls,"Update 4/22/2020
The customer service at this company is phenomenal. After writing my previous review, they reached out immediately to send a replacement. While the call quality still isn’t as good as I would like, listening to music on these headphones is a great experience. They’re nice truly wireless headphones for a very low price. Well constructed and sound great. The only negative is the microphone isn’t great for calls, but otherwise a great buy. When backed by stellar customer service, you can certainly buy a lot worse headphones! —-————-—————————————
I bought these mostly for talking on the phone while doing other things. They seemed like they would be a great option, based on reviews, to provide decent call quality while being inexpensive. While the call coming through on my end was crystal clear, others reported “breathy” sounds and unclear quality from my end. Using one headphone independently was even worse, as the the audio on their end would break in and out frequently. I wanted to love these as they sounded great on my end, but had to return them as they weren’t good for phone calls. Probably would be great for someone who wanted to use them solely for listening to music."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-08,Quit charging after one week,"This one really got my nose out of joint. At first I loved these earbuds but after only a week, the right earbud would not charge. I tried everything, to get them to charge to no avail. I bought these based on several reviews, not just Amazon’s because I try to do my research before I buy so this is really disappointing. I returned them for a refund."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Amazing sound quality,"My previous Bluetooth headset lost its ability to charge, so I considered buying a new one. I am just looking for products with good sound quality and reasonable isolation, as well as products with longer battery life. These are on sale, so I decided to give them a try. Not only are these very comfortable, but the sound quality is also very good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Premium price,"The packaging is incredible, the manufacturing quality is top-notch, and even if the price is twice the price, its price has amazing functions. Wireless charging, IPX8 waterproof, high-quality 8mm sound driver and Bluetooth v5.0 are just some of the high-end features provided by the T10."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,"Great sound, very fit","I did n’t expect that much for the price, but I was shocked by the sound quality ... the clear velvety bass sound. The reception distance is really good and there is no quality loss at the end of the pool. It's nice to know that if I accidentally drop one into the water or fall from my ear, I can oop it up and move on. But it is doubtful that this will happen in a tight and comfortable position. Very satisfied with my purchase."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Great battery life,Great overall product. Difficult removing both at same time.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Good earbuds at sub $50 price point.,"Nice earbuds for under $50. Decent sound quality, quick charging, well packaged, nicely built. Fitting typical earbuds for me is normally a problem but these fit without any problem. I’ve only had them a week at this writing but expect they will hold up nicely."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,Exactly what we need,"I ordered these headphones for my husband who likes to wear headphones at night to help him fall asleep. He needs to keep making noise without waking me up. They came today and have exceeded our expectations! We have been looking for low-key earplugs for some time, and are a little scared. These earplugs are too high, and they will be uncomfortable when placed in the ears. But these are great, low-key, and won't move or fall when scrolling. This is a good case, you can charge the earbuds, and before removing the earbuds, you can see on the box whether the earbuds are fully charged. They also come with extra covers and 3 different buds to suit your ears. The sound is also good. The price of these headphones is not Bose, but a great sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,Sound Quality is best,"I think this could be one the best earphone I got recently and I really liked it. They way it fits you ear perfectly , amazing sounding and the best noise cancellation are the most important features of this product. This could be the best one if you are in gym and it doesn't fall off your ear. I have recommended this to my friends and they even liked it alot."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,"Very nice, very comfortable, and very good sound","I do think that the new generation of geekee 550 earbuds may be better than the product in some respects, but ironically, I want to say that some of their requirements for this model are even better than the new model. First of all, I prefer the battery indicator because it can display the remaining charge in the charging case. On this model it can display three dots so that you can clearly see half or less of the full charge, while the new It is difficult to read on the indicator. I also like that it has a little extra, you can firmly fix it in your ears, and it is definitely suitable for exercise. I definitely feel more confident that they will not come out of my ears. If I had to write this comment about pure sound quality, I think I would have to choose 550. no matter which way"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,Great Buy,I love the sound and the fit in my ears. Some of those other wireless buds fall out easily. But these fit very well and are easy to operate.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,High-quality sound!,"This pair of earplugs is very comfortable and the sound is very loud! The treble is clear, the midrange is strong, and the bass is deep. I like the fact that after pairing it with my phone, I can actually see the name (Geekee) of the earbuds, not the model, so it is easy to find it!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,These are amazing,"I have had these for a month and I wanted to give my enthusiastic thumbs-up. These earbuds are very easy to use, have great sound quality, and will connect to any bluetooth device (I have tested my phone and computer, haven't tested my TV or PS4 yet). I will be returning another pair of bluetooth headphones I got for PC gaming that were more than double the price because these do the same job but better. I had issues with my other set that were very annoying and they didn't even connect to my phone. These have been wonderful."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,Review,Sound is really good and battery is long lasting.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,They will not fall!,"I always wanted to buy a pair of completely wireless earbuds, but I didn't want to pay most of the prices above $ 100. I have always been skeptical about this type of earplugs, because I fear they will fall and lose one or both. These earplugs work well, but I wear them while mowing the lawn, cycling, exercising, and around the house, and they never fall off! They are equipped with several different sizes of earplugs / earplugs, but standard earplugs / earplugs are very suitable for me. I was also surprised by their good sealing effect. When I use both at the same time, just pause for a while, and I still can't hear the people around you, you will most likely have to remove one of them to hear other sounds around. The sound of these earplugs is also quite good, and the battery life is also very long. My only complaint is the button,"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-09,Long lasting battery and no wires required,"This is one of the most unique earbuds I ever seen, not often that the case also have qi charging available. The main purpose I buy this is for the lazy habits of not plugging it in. I like to place to a qi platform that charge my case easy. Also this was on a super deal. I did not see any other wireless earbuds that also have qi charging. When I run in my backyard, this stay in my ears and it did not fall out. Also I listen to a lot of podcast, I can listen to it clearly, more clear than usual. Another thing I noticed was the battery is not bad at all, it will last quite awhile without recharging much."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-09,Great quality at a great price.,HAve had mine for a while and I highly recommend these to anyone!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-10,Premium price,"The price of these earplugs is amazing and the quality is amazing. They have excellent sound quality and are very comfortable. My ears are small, so it is difficult to find comfortable earplugs, but they are great, and all ears come in 4 different sizes."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-10,Wow literally just as good as all the expensive brands,Really great and easy to connect! They instantly reconnect as soon as you take them out of the case too!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-10,Pretty Awesome Value. Feel and look better then you know who.,"These ear pods are a great value. Sound is pretty good. Fit is comfortable . I’ve had them in my ears 5-6 hours and the fit is better then my Apple Airs. Battery life is better too. H2O proof and wireless charging is all bonus time. Cheap enough that I won’t worry If I lose them. I’ll buy 3 more pairs and still be below the white sticks. Don’t get me wrong, I like my Apple AirPods, but these frankly are better value."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-10,Easy to set up and use.,The ease of use and sound quality were better than expected.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-10,Great noise canceling,"My daughter loves these headphones, with the newly “embraced” homeschooling. She is able to pop them to do zoom classes or duolingo, the noise cancelling feature keeps the kids from bothering her."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-10,Great product!!,I am really enjoying these ear phones. The bass is amazing and sound clarity is awesome. I am primarily using it for watching movies and shows on my laptop. I also like the compact charger that keeps the ear buds charged.. lovvvvvvvve it! !
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-10,Missed the mark,"Borrowed my wife's Skullcandy Sesh and was impressed with the sound, being my first time trying true wireless earbuds. Wanting to get myself a pair, but thought I could do better in the price range. The build quality is great, really nice looking. USB C and wireless charging makes it feel like a 2020 device unlike the rest with micro USB. One thing I can't get over is the flat sound of them. There is very minimal bass. I don't listen to rap or pop music, but when there's bass, I expect to hear bass. They just don't sound ""full"" or ""robust"", just meh. I tried adjusting some EQ in my phone but just couldn't get it right."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-10,"Reasonable price, amazing sound quality in slim packaging","My previous Bluetooth headset lost its ability to charge, so I considered buying a new headset. I am just looking for products with good sound quality and reasonable isolation, as well as products with longer battery life. These are on sale, so I decided to give it a try. Not only are these very comfortable, but the sound quality is also very good. The background hiss is small (this is typical of active headphones), but it is low enough not to interfere with my appreciation of music, and it does let me know they are turned on. The compact charging / carrying case is beautifully designed. Compared with Apple AirPods, it is a bit large, but it has enough batteries to charge the earbuds 4 times, and it can also be charged wirelessly or via USB. AirPods still cannot do this. All of these are great little earplugs and good value for money. Even at normal prices, they are orders of magnitude cheaper than AirPods or Jabra Elite 65t."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-11,Some features advertised are completely false.,"The most important point I want to stress in this entire review is that the features listed on this product are completely incorrect and some feel misleading. I first want to state that I never leave reviews, to be honest I'm just too lazy to,but this product is so inaccurate that I returned them after having them for 5 minutes. The features listed state that you will be able to use each earbud independently and that they will both have volume control. Even in the question and answers the cellar of this product states that these can be used independently and have volume control. As soon as you open up the user manual and turn to the troubleshooting page it point-blank tells you that you cannot use the earbuds separately and that the earbuds do not have volume control. Another thing I want to stay is that while this claims to have touch control on the earbuds this is true, but it feels very misleading. Most earbud products when they say ""touch control"" they mean that you can tap the product with your finger and that will constitute a ""touch"". This product however you must actually physically press down on the earbud until you feel a mechanical click on the earbud in order to constitute a ""touch"". The sound quality from what I listened to (five minutes of music before taking them off and returning them) was pretty decent for earbuds. Even with the largest ear tips on I still could not get a complete seal with the earbuds in so I could hear all the ambient noise around me with no noise cancellation. I never got to test a battery life so I just gave it a five-star. There are much better earbuds out there than this one especially for this price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-11,Good product at a very affordable price; extremely outstanding customer support!,"I bought the original Earfun Free earbuds back in December of last year and used it primarily for listening to music and making and receiving phone calls. I've been very pleased with results, especially when using it for phone calls with no more wire headsets. After a few months of using the product, I ran into issues with left earbud failure and also microphone malfunctioning; contacted the Earfun customer support and received a very prompt response within couple of hours! Earfun customer support promptly processed and sent me a new '2020 upgraded' Earfun Free and everuthing is now workinkg very well. The customer representative, Andrea, is extremely responsive, caring, and follows through with customer needs. I am very impressed with the Earfun customer support!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-11,"They work really well, and sound really good",I used this to listen to music
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-11,Connects quickly and survived laundry,"It connects within the time it takes to be lifted out of the case and put in the ear. I like that it confirms the connection with a ""connected"" phrase rather than a beep like some other headsets. Recently I left it in my clothing that was put into the washer. I thought it might be damaged, but put it into the dryer anyway to remove any moisture before turning it back on. Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised that it works just fine."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-11,don't stay in my ears,"They seem to be good quality, and calls seem to be fine, but they keep falling out of my ears! I tried all three size plugs, and none of them seem to work very well. The best I can do is switch ears and they stay in a little better. Maybe I just have weird ears."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,"Great product, sensitive to touch","What I want to say is that I have rated these three levels before, not because they are not a good product, but because one of the earplugs stopped working. I rarely write reviews that I have read for a long time, and choose these reviews because of their high ratings. When I first connected them, they were great! Excellent sound quality, good range, I can use one at a time in my work. Then the right earbud stopped working and could not connect to my Samsung android. The reason I write reviews is that when I research products, I like to see the middle part of the road commentary, and I find them to be the most useful and probably the most authentic. I am very satisfied with this product, although only one of them is useless because they still exceed my expectations. Professional sound quality (excellent), range (over 40 feet), battery life (at least 8 hours of work per day), the most important one at a time. My disadvantages are that the correct earbuds do not work properly and the sensitivity of the touchpad."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,Very good,The product is what it said it was and i like it so far its worth what i paid
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,These wireless earbuds are the best!!,"I love Apple products and was going to purchase the white ear buds that practically everyone is using today. I'm so glad I purchased these instead. What a great product! I absolutely love them! I wear them at the gym when I'm working out, watching movies late at night, and even while I'm at work (you can wear just one of them if you want). They easily connect, have great sound, look so much better (in my opinion) than Apple's white ear buds hanging down the sides of your face.. :o) and FAR LESS EXPENSIVE! The charge is pretty solid, about 6 hours or so of playing time, and you hear a warning when battery life runs low. Somewhat of a silly brand name, seriously, but who cares??!! Lol! :-)
btw...I still love MOST of the Apple products. :-)"
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-12,Broken,Broke within 2 month’s
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,"High quality, truly wireless headphones perfect for a workout","I've been using these headphones for about a week now. Given the COVID-19 situation, I've been limited to working out from home and these have come in handy. They fit very well and stay in place during a run on the treadmill. The sound quality is also excellent, and I like that it can be charged wirelessly with the case. Battery life has also been quite good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,Best Earbuds I have had,"Arrived right on time, and actually faster then I had expected. They are so comfortable to wear, and the sound is amazing. I highly recommend buying these! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,Better than expected,"I was looking for an expensive pair of buds to back up my Bose and to my surprise, I like them better than then Bose. They have a great sound, keep noise out and fits snug in my earn without pain. I use these more than the Bose. I love them. Great bang for your buck!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Good sound for the price,Exactly what I wanted
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,I have lost some expensive earbuds so I was looking for low cost with quality.,For the price these wireless Earbuds are definite winner
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Incredible sound cancellation...almost too good to be out in public wearing them,Great product so far. My only complaint is that it says it can charge several different ways but doesn’t say whether it comes with a charger. I couldn’t not find that in the product description. I needed them fast so I bought usb-c charging cords that I did not need. I know I should assume that it came with a charger but that’s not always the case with some products on amazon.
EarFun,Free,1,0,2020-04-13,I'd really love these...,"But I bought two pairs, and had problems with them both. The right earbud in one set refuses to charge ever, the other right earbud can be spotty too. First set broke almost immediately, the other became spotty over several months of use. Until they broke, the sound quality was good, and the feature set for the price is unparalleled. However, For reliability reasons, I would not purchase these again, and cannot recommend them to others."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,The price is very good!,"These earplugs are excellent in almost all respects. The sound quality is very good. The midrange and treble are super clear without distortion. Honestly, the quality is better than I expected. Bass is also obvious. The construction quality is also first-class. The watch case is sturdy and durable, and is equipped with a satisfactory magnetic cover and hard plastic, with a good texture. The headset itself has the same high-quality structure and materials. The connection is seamless in nature. The first time I paired, I had a little difficulty, but I only need to reset it twice. After that, the connection is almost instant."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Reliable Earbuds,"Was a lot bigger than I had thought it would be but the performance is there and gets the job done. It was easy to set up and connect to your device. Only issue is that how it fits in my ear, but this varies from person to person. If you're looking for cheaper earbuds that get the job done, I think this does the job."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Good and cheap earplugs!,"Excellent sound, battery life, wireless charging, USB-C, amazing fit. Noise cancellation, waterproof (although I haven't tested this yet.) Sturdy construction, the prices I received are amazing. If your ears are really small, this fit may slightly accentuate your ears. The battery life is what the box claims. After the first charge, I used it almost continuously for six hours, from 100% to about 76%. After three days of testing, I got fairly consistent results. Six hours = approximately 25% of battery used."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,They are amazing you get quality and a reasonable prices!,"I really liked how nicely the fit and stay on the ears, they have a great base, and a nice sound on general (obviously don't expect something masterful but they are good, really good especially for the price) they have volume control and that is great, the only thing is that pushing the button can be annoying for some people but I personally dont mind, but I really REALLY like them and the guarantee is nice and they shipped super fast, they are a 5 for me"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,An inexpensive sonic and technological marvel,"I'm a former professional musician who, when I got tired of being in bars until 3 in the morning, went into the high end audio business. One of the things I used to teach the salespeople, was to conduct listening comparisons for customers between two differently priced items, rather than two at the same price. The reason was purely commercial: comparing two good similarly priced items usually led to ambivalence (""...on the one hand I like A because...on the other I like B because...) and the customer leaving without buying anything to think it over. On the other hand, if they liked the more expensive one better, it was ""well, you gets what you pay for"" and they'd typically pony up. If they were ambivalent, then ""why spend more if you're not even sure which one you prefer?"" and they'd buy the cheaper one and feel they'd gotten a bargain. And if they liked the cheaper one *better*, well, then the choice was a real no-brainer. These, for me, were in the no-brainer category. I ordered them based on reviews and because they were so inexpensive, and I've been thoroughly enjoying them. But I had no frame of reference and couldn't help wondering what the expensive ones sounded like. Best Buy had Master's and Dynamic MW07 Go on sale for $160 (I paid about $37 for the EarFuns here on Amazon). On first listen, I knew it would be hard to justify the additional cost. On more extensive listening, it turned out the EarFuns had better bass response and (after trying all the different combination of tips and wings that came with the M&D) fit me better. And the case charges wirelessly (M&D's does not). And they have a higher water-resistance rating. A note on fit: if earbuds don't essentially completely seal in your ear, you'll get no bass to speak of. From any earbuds. So, while I could not get as good a seal with the M&D as I could with the Earfuns, I was curious about whether they would sound better than the Earfuns if I held them tightly in place thus creating a perfect seal. Nope. Better than when they weren't quite locked in, but not as good as the Earfuns. Since walking around pressing on your earbuds isn't viable, it was an academic experiment, but, again, the earfuns sounded better anyway. So there you have it. To recap:
Sound Quality: Earfun, most noticeably bass. Mid and treble roughly a tie. Battery Life: Earfun (four charges from the case rather than two, resulting in about 30 hours total vs 22 for M&D)
Wireless charging: Earfun Yep; M&D nope. Water Proof-ness: Earfun IPX7; M&D IPX6
I didn't compare them for talking on-the-phone-quality for the simple reason that I don't give a damn; these are for listening to music. That said, I did take a call from my wife on the earfuns the other day. She sounded absolutely crystal clear. She said I sounded a bit distant/speak-phoney, but intelligible. Good enough for me. When I bought these I really liked them a lot. Now that I have a basis for comparison with something costing over 4 x as much and that's widely touted as a music lover's earbud, I freakin' love them! P"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Great value for these earbuds!,"I'm always looking for best value and these earbuds have a ton. Great sound
Wireless Charging & USB-C charging cable
Great battery life
Good fit
Waterproof
I've had the Earfun earbuds for 2 weeks now. For the most part, I picked these up for running. I'd recently had some over the ear wired earbuds which finally crapped out on me after 3 or 4 years of use. I was worried the Earfun earbuds would not stay in my ears while running. That hasn't been a problem at all. So far I've ran in light rain / hard misting and temps over 80F so I had a good sweat going. I have noticed they'll try and creep out of your ear hole just a little so sometimes you may have to spin it to get it nestled back down in your ear again. I had another pair of wireless earbuds with a wire between them and they fell out all the time, usually within 10-15 mins of starting to run. Battery life has been excellent. I like to take rechargeable equipment and run it dead the very first time before I charge it. After two weeks, I've used them about 8ish hours. I put them back in the case when I'm done and the case still has 3 out of 4 dots. I've not had to charge the case this entire time! If things go sideways anytime soon, I'll be sure to come back and update this review. Sound is excellent as well. I listen to all kinds of audio. Typically when I run, I like audio books, so most of my time has been spent listening. The Earfun earbuds do great (probably too good) at keeping outside noises down so I can hear the audio perfectly for my audio books. I'm listening to some music right now. It's a mix of pop, heavy metal and rap. Bass lines hit much better than I'd expect, but it's balanced well and I can pick out voices great and top end end isn't tinny or overpowered. Overall, they sound great. Overall, I've been very pleased with the Earfun earbuds after a couple weeks of use. For the price, these devices hit all the right marks. I'd definitely recommend and hope they can hold up to long term use!"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-13,"Quality control issues, connectivity problems, Sound is just ok. Would not recommend","I purchased these because I am now required to work at home a few times a week with COVID patients remotely. Headphones sound was just ok initially but opened up a bit once they were playing music for 30 minutes. The First issue was the right earphone re-connecting repeatedly and not syncing(tried all troubleshooting the company suggested). These headphones also don't stay in the ear very well and fall out, so if you plan on working out with them I would try a different headphone. LASTLY and most importantly, the right earphone would not charge in the case. After resetting I realized it did not seat well in the charging case, making imperfect contact with the charging pins. Sent in for replacement, so we will see what happens
Based on my experience I would NOT recommend these."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Great Buds,"I really like the earbud. The case and the charge is great. The only think I'm not crazy about, they don't stay secure in the ear. You must be careful or you could lose them"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-13,Bueno,Muy bueno... Un poquito grande... Pero esta bien...
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,"Cool, smooth and light weight !!!","The EarFun earbuds are ultra-easy to utilize and the sound quality is about as flawless as I have ever heard. The bass is so much better and by and large clearness of sounds. The earbuds likewise have a cool, smooth, lightweight form, they fit superbly in the ear and don't tumble off, It perfectly work with android and iphone devices without any issues."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,Great value for price compared to more expensive options.,Have only had few days. It works great so far. Used for running in a sub tropical hot climate. Waterproof and stable in ear. Also use for calls. Works great there as well.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,Really Amazing,"When I heard the music with this earphone, it really exceeds the expectation and battery life is also nice. But for the price, its a steal. call quality is also good and I used to have samsung buds which had really bad voice quality, so compared to that it feels amazing."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,The best earbuds,"Reasons why I loved these headphones:
Water resistant (so if you sweat a lot while using them it won't be a problem)
Excellent sound (you can control the sound power and whatever you choose the sound quality will be very good)
Battery: I have used it for 2 consecutive hours two days and they kept working perfectly. Charger: Light and small so you can carry it everywhere in your pocket."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,"Fantastic value for money, best earpods I've used!","They're very light, but don't let that fool you into thinking they're cheap. These earpods have a great battery life, pair incredibly easily and are perfect for music and podcasts alike. The microphone is very sensitive and I've never had issues being heard on calls, which was a big factor in my choice of earpods. Additionally, I had an issue where my charging case stopped working just outside the return period for Amazon. I contacted EarFun and because I was still covered by the warranty they'd send me a new one, free of charge. The customer service was impeccable and if I ever need a new set, I'll be buying another pair from EarFun."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,Amazing small earbuds,It came fast. The case is small and portable. It has USB-C charger and fast charging. I most like the ear plug which gives comfortable and sizable cushion for your ear channel. Sound quality is as expected. I have been using for 2 weeks and it really gives I want to see.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,Cheap but still high quality,"I bought these headphones several months ago when I realized I was going to have a lot of time at work that I could use headphones, and didn't want to deal with corded headphones. They have been absolutely phenomenal. I cannot recommend these enough, especially for the price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,My favorite!,"I've tried a handful of wireless earbuds and these are the to of my list. I needed a set with a case that charges wirelessly, which these have. They charge fast and it's great to always have them fully charged or charging right next to my phone. Sounds quality hasn't given me any issues. They comfortable start in my ears even though a run. No issues on the water resistance either! Overall these hit all my boxes and delivers on everything I need them to. Can't argue with the price, either!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,Punch above their weight class,"While these aren't going to win any awards against headphones that cost multiple times this price, I was pleasantly surprised at just how good these sound! Overall sound quality exceeded my expectations for something in this price range. The carrying case isn't gigantic and comes equipped with a modern USB C Port. I'd be happy to recommend these to anyone looking for wireless earbuds on a budget."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-04-14,High-Value Earbuds,"Overall, I would recommend these headphones if you are specifically looking for true wireless earbuds in the ~$50 price range. Key features:
-Good sound quality: Surpassed my expectations for earbuds at this price point. Tuned reasonably, with more balance than some overly bass-heavy earbuds in this category
-Strong battery life and wireless charging case: Great value - not sure that I've seen others in this price range with Qi wireless charging built into the case. A pleasant surprise, and something I've come to use and appreciate. No, they're not Bose / Airpods Pro, but they're also a fraction of the price. And they're very good value at this price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,perfect to keep in my car,"I like to have a few different pairs of headphones that I keep at different locations so I always have one available. I keep this one in my car if I decide to go for a jog after work. The battery life is strong enough that it always lasts for hours and I charge it while I'm driving so it's ready to go. Noise cancellation is pretty solid as well. Sound quality seems to be comparable to more expensive alternatives. I am a fan of the black color, and it is compatible with my wireless charger if I do bring it inside. Overall a quality pair of earbuds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-14,Comply 35-42032-11 TrueGrip Pro Memory Foam Tips for Samsung Galaxy Buds True Wireless Earbuds,"These are quite good headphones, especially considering the price. They are Just a wee bit sharp (treble heavy) for me and I wish I could turn them up to eleven as they don’t quite quite loud enough in some situations. I have turned the volume up all the way on my phone before and found the volume wasn’t very loud. I fixed it by pressing the volume up on the physical buttons of the headphones. These headphones are of such good quality and features that I’d buy them again without hesitation. I disliked the silicone buds that came with it. My wife has a pair of galaxy buds and the tips are better, so I was using those, but I still was still having issues with proper seating. I bough the medium size Comply 35-42032-11 TrueGrip Pro Memory Foam Tips for Samsung Galaxy Buds True Wireless Earbuds and they fit great in my ear and in my Earfün charging case. Get these headphones. I recommend foam ear tips. You’ll like them. They are superb."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,A well-designed earphone is the first choice for listening to music and a must-have for driving,"After I got the earphones, I couldn't wait to do the test. I turned on the music, and as the volume increased, there was no noise. I made a phone call to my wife while driving, and I could hear her voice clearly, as if I were talking face to face.The earplugs were perfectly made and fitted my ears, even though I wore them all day and didn't feel any pain"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,Great buds,"Excellant earbuds, they do a good job at noise cancellation wore mine the other day while using a chainsaw. They are very comfortable to wear for a long time and they snap back into the case well. The battery life is excellent compared to other brands"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,A pleasant shopping trip,It is very comfortable to wear and the sound effect is very good.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,"EarFun, Baby!","My first pair of individuated Bluetooth earbuds, and I love them! Crazy-easy to charge, connect, and place in your ears. Comes with three sizes of rubber tips. Well done, EarFun!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,Great!,Works great and prices right!
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-15,Do not stay in ears,Hard to keep them stay in the ears. Keep on falling out especially when moving around. Really defeats the purpose of a wireless earbud.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-15,Low depth and low bass,"These are pretty subpar as far as sound goes, especially for the price. I’m surprised the rating is as high as it is on these. Let them completely charge before pairing and testing. Bass is VERY low, audio clarity is great otherwise. I had to turn my vol up pretty high to get to decent levels. Will be returning"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,It looks very nice,"There is nothing to do at home is to listen to music and play games, compatibility is good, soon connected.There is no uncomfortable feeling, the cutting volume adjustment is ok, switching freely, can be used for a long time, the sound of music is clear and pleasant, no noise, listening to the song is particularly comfortable."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-15,Good earbuds,The wireless earbuds sounds very clear and is the best bang for your buck. The battery life is up to par also. The only issue I found is that I had a hard time fitting in my ears.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,Great item!,Absolutely love these!
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-15,Mic is not working properly,"Ok, the sound in these earbuds is fine but the mic has issues sometimes you can hear clearly then suddenly you can not anymore, and if you disconnected them the other person will hear you fine right away means that is not signal issues, it is not connectivity issues between the phone and the buds because I tested it with the phone just next to the buds just in case I had any other Bluetooth signal interference. I don't know if this an isolated case but I am returning these buds and wont try my chances ordering the same brand again."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-15,Unstable bluetooth connection,"Sound is good but bluetooth connection is unstable. I need to be looking directly at the tv for the bluetooth to remain connected to both sides. If I turn my head to one side that side looses connection. When listening to music on my phone and I put my phone in my pocket the connection becomes unstable, dropping from one ear or another periodicity. Sound quality is good, fit is good, battery is good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,Quality,I've only used them for 5-10 minutes. My son is borrowing them until his new ear phones arrive from...AMAZON.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-16,Disappointment for Me,"The sound quality on the headphones is good. The noise cancellation is too good. After reading reviews, I chose these headphones for two purposes - running and for video associated with video conferencing. The first time I ran, one of the headphones fell out of my ear. During a video conference, the noise cancellation was so good I couldn't hear myself speaking. Unfortunately, that won't work for my purposes."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,Great customer service,"I was surprised for what I got for the price. Overall they're really good. Sound quality is well balanced with good amount of bass. Synchronization is quite easy, and noise cancellation is great. Only aspect that I could complain would be the microphone. It doesn't catch low sounds for me. Last but not least, their customer service is the best I've seen in a long time."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,Would re purchase,Great ear buds.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,Loud and strong,exactly what you pay for. Loud and strong. My friend says my mic is clear when I used the built in mic to make a call on discord. Good pieces.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-16,EarFun Ear buds,"I Have to admit the sound quality is better than i expected, I never heard of this company before, so therefore i took a chance on buying this product. I am pleased with this product and do recommend it to others. I gave the product a 4 star overall rating, because of the largeness of the earbuds, they could of been a little bit smaller , but i'm sure ill get use to them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,Worth the purchase and its value.,Earfun wireless earbuds battery life last longer than my current skull-candy wireless earbuds that I am currently replacing from what I have bought from Target. What I am surprised is that it has a strong and durable case where is it has less chance of getting it cracked. The bonus I always have difficulty with is other wireless connectivity of other bluetooth earbuds are difficult to connect and disconnect. I never expected Ear-fun earbuds to connect precisely quick and accurate including during my gaming while playing GTA 5.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,"Nice size, shape, and sound!","These work great! I love that the case charges wirelessly, and that they sync super easy. Phone calls were clear through them, and I listened to music for a while without a problem! The case is very nice, and the headphones slide in and out easier than my AirPods. Size wise, they are a little on the large size, and it may not as easily fit in small ears, but my medium ears had no problem, and they do include different tips. Please note I received this item for free. Thanks!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,Birthday Present,Very comfortable in you ears unlike other ear buds. I like them because I can still hear slight external communication. I would recommend them to anyone. They were a great buy.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-16,Better than most cheap earbuds.,Good balanced sound. Not shrill as most cheap earbuds.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-17,Dead after 3 weeks,"I’ve had this product for 3 weeks, and it stopped playing anything through them. It tells me it’s connected, then nothing."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Love them,Got these for my husband. He loves them. Great sound quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Good quality earbuds for the price,"I like the overall quality of the earbuds. The product was nicely packaged. The earbuds come precharged, so you can start using it immediately, but I recommend to charge it fully before first use (which hardly takes a few minutes)
The overall sound quality is good, but I would be happier if the bass is more enhanced. It reduces the outside noise, but I would not call these as noise-canceling ones. The battery life is good. The earbuds pair very quickly with the phone through Bluetooth. They are small, so be careful not to lose them. But I would not worry about it, as they fit very comfortably in the ear. The charging cable is a bit short, so you have to connect it to a laptop. I couldn't use it to charge through the USB panel on my kitchen counter."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Great headphones!,Wow! Great little headphones. These sound a lot better than I thought they would. Great value for the price!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Great wireless lightweight earphones for great price,This is the third or fourth time I am buying wireless earphones and this one has exceeded my expectations so far. Sound quality is great. All types of sounds are crystal clear. Bass is on lower side but I like that. Fits nicely. Also comes with extra buds for comfortable fit. Battery life is great. I have been using it for good amount of time over the last 2 days and it still has about 75% battery life. Quality is quite impressive for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-17,Great little speakers.,"These little speakers do their job very well. They don't have the sound quality of my +$400 over the ear speakers, but I wouldn't expect that. They are much better than I anticipated. I love that they automatically turn on and pair, one at a time when I take them out of the case and turn off when I place them back in the case. Working from home and on phone calls, I'm using them so I'm hands free, and they work great for that."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Surprisingly good. Connects easy,"Easy to use, and connected effortlessly to my phone. Sound quality is great. I liked how you can use one earbud at a time, it doesn't matter what side. Shipping was fast!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,"Good Product, great price",Delivered 1 day earlier than anticipated. Probably best used being stationary. Bluetooth has great range. Plenty long battery life. No ear fatigue.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,better than real airpods,my mom bought me this for a present and my friend has airpods and i tryed them on and these are 1 million percent better inststant buy

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Great earbuds for the price,"These are great ear buds, had them for 3 days and they sound good. Cant complain."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Great buy,"Best eat buds for the price for me hands down. Im around heavy equipment 80% of my work day. Calls are clear, as am I. Music is clean. I would recommend over and again."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-17,Bad microphone,"The headphones sound great and functionality is awesome. The microphone is sub par, and would not recommend if you need these headphones to make calls on. People say it sounds like I am underwater."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,Great earbuds for the price!,"These are great wireless earbuds for the price! I'll give some pros and a couple cons:
Pros:
1. They have great battery life. They lasted at least 7 hours playing a regular volume. Way better than the last pair a had. 2. They have good sound quality. It's a nice, balanced sound - not too heavy on bass or too tinny. They're clear and full enough. 3. They fit in the ear really nice and will definitely not fall out! 4. They're very comfortable. 5. They have touch controls that work well and allow a lot of control through the buds. 6. Because they fit in the ear so well, they really help to block outside noise. 7. USB-C charging case
Cons:
1. They may not be heavy enough on bass for those who really like bass. 2. The volume doesn't get as loud as other earbuds
3. The case isn't waterproof
Overall, I'd recommend these to anyone looking for a decent pair of earbuds!,"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-17,Not quality,Cheaply made and after three weeks I still have not received a refund
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-18,Great product!,"I have not had a chance to see how long the battery last. The sound is great, but I still do hear outside noises but not as much if I had regular earbuds in."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-18,Great affordable earbuds,"Great earbuds, especially for the price. Much better bass than most. I choose these because C-Net rated them best buy under $100. I was not disappointed."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-18,good for the price,Nice balance between price and quality
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-18,They dont stay in your ears,These fell out of my ears constantly. Tried different sizes that are included but I think it's just the way they are designed. Otherwise good but I'm returning them and getting ones that wont fall out.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Great headphones for the prie,"I've tried the Tozo T10 and I was so bitterly disappointed in them that I was about to spend over $100 to get a name brand wireless headphone (JBL) for my workouts. Then I went onto CNET, as I'm sure many of the purchasers of this product have, and saw the review for this item as one of the best in the price range. I totally agree with the CNET review of this product so I recommend you read that if you want to know how this product fairs. Its worked great for me and saved me a ton of money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Great Buy for a great price,My parent loves them!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-19,It’s okay,People have a hard time hearing me at times; they say I cut out sporadically.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-19,Awesome headphones,"The price point is a little higher than some models out there, but you get what you pay for. These are great, and have great sound quality. Easy to use."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,i very like it,"This is good product I like it, The sound quality is good and easy paring and connecting.I highly recommend it not only due to the features of wireless but also due to the great sound quality as well!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Amazing sound quality and excellent grip wireless earbuds with active notice cancellation.,Amazing sound with true active notice cancellations. The bass effect is nice and it’s a joy to use it during workout. The grip of the earpiece is good and it does not slip out even while running. I regularly use it while exercising and would define recommend it to something who is looking to buy a new for active use or even for listening to music.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Good qualiry,The babyreceived it，the headset does not have any flaws the wayworkmanship isvery good，it looks small and exquisite，very fashionable，the connection effect is very good，the automatic link，I like it very much。
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Comfortable,"The sound quality of the headphones is very good,the sound is mild,it will not be harsh and sharp,and there is no noise.I like this sound quality,and the headphones are very comfortable to wear."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Great Product,"These earbuds are great, sound quality, noise canceling, and battery life. I have Shure (wired, very expensive) earphone, these little earbuds work just as good."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-20,Sound cutting out and connectivity issues,"I have not been able to get these earphones to function properly at all. They are a nice shape and weight, and the noise cancellation and sound quality are both pretty good. However, the issues I’m having are making them basically unusable so I’m giving it one star. I have reset both the earphones and the devices I am pairing them with multiple times with no improvement. While using them, the sound continually cuts in and out (I am sitting with a computer in my lap, not jogging or even moving at all) and often just disconnects entirely. When the sound cuts in and out, it takes one or more resets to solve the issue, and it might happen again within 20 minutes. When they completely disconnect, they will not reconnect for several minutes/tries at least. I have tried turning on/off bluetooth, updating and restarting my devices, turning off and doing hard resets on the earphones. I’m disappointed, since they seem to be pretty nice quality but I was hoping to use them both at home and while walking. It’s clear that this pair is either defective or the connectivity is just not good on this product."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-20,sound,Great sound great battery life if worn all day will make your ear sore im a truck driver and I have to have them all day but other then that great set of earbuds
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Good Wireless Earbud I ever used ;),Fit perpectly onto my ears and have good sound. Noise isolation is great and the quality is also very amazing
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Girlfriend loves them,"She especially loves them because she cannot hear me talk when she has them in! No, only good things to say about them and a great value."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-20,Great earbuds for the price.,"After diving through tons of bluetooth earbud reviews, these are definitely the ones to go with if you don't have the money to spend on AirPods. Not only is connecting them to devices INCREDIBLY easy, but their battery life is great. Is the sound brilliant? Of course not. But if you just want a way to listen to music on your run without dealing with wires, these are perfect. And the case is magnetic, which makes losing them pretty difficult, and there's an indicator to tell you if the buds are fully-charged."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Sound effect is good,"The sound effect is very good，I readily did not expect to buy such a good headset at this price,the sound quality is very good,the workmanship is also very fine,and there are no defects."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-20,"Decent sound quality, uncomfortable fit.","My biggest complaint is they get uncomfortable. The standard ear adaptor didn't fit at all, just fell right out. I had to use the largest ones. For the most part they stay in decently, it takes a bit of turning them so they contour the ear just right to stay in. Other wise they slowly slide out, same thing if you have excess oil from you skin on them. The problem is after about and hour or two I need to take them out, they start to hurt. This really sucks because I specifically bought these to wear at work for 5-6 hours a day. I loved Apples headphones, they were wicked comfy but I didn't want to buy an adaptor and have a wire and I didn’t want to drop the $$$ for airpods. The sound quietly is pretty good. Not the best but no complaints. I think it actually sounds better when it comes to podcasts and audiobooks than music. They aren’t noise canceling but they do a pretty decent job of blocking out allot of the outside noise, more than I expected them to. The controls are simple to use, I do wish it was a light touch instead of pressing the button. Because they are uncomfortable I don't want to push them into my ear anymore than they already are. So, overall not bad, but not great. Unless they fix the comfort issue I don't think I would purchase them again. I have all Apple products, I should have just gone with apple."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-20,Won't stay connected,"I've had them for a little over a week and they seem to be having trouble staying connected to whatever device I'm using. Yesterday I was trying to listen to an audiobook while gardening and they kept cutting in and out. This morning I paired them with my chromebook and tried to watch a 3-minute video. I had to reconnect the bluetooth four or five times before I finally gave up. Given that it's happening with different devices in different situations and conditions, I'm inclined to think it's the earbuds. Battery charges on all devices have been good, and there's no chance it's distance or obstacles since the phone was in my pocket and the laptop was right in front of me. Disappointing."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Good product,"Beautiful sound quality, comfortable experience, beautiful music can bring us different feelings, like this headset to send out a kind of beautiful music, each note sends out different charm from the headset
The product has a beautiful appearance, gives people a feeling of excitement, and is satisfied with the product as a whole"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Sleek design,This was a gift and my friend loves it. The design is probably the highlight here. They are sleek and look good. Water resistance and wireless charging are great additions!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Wiress Ear System,"I have used a couple of wireless headphones and these are the first that do not have any sort of interference so far. Usually while I am working out I keep my phone in my gym bag and get too far away or something but I have not had this problem with these. It has been great to set it and forget it. Also the one touch operation works great with my Google Assistant so even when I don't have my phone readily at hand I can use my voice commands. The headphones also have three different sizes for your ear comfort which is great cuz I typically will end up taking my old ones out because they became uncomfortable after 15 or 20 minutes but I have used these for 2 to 3 hours outside working and haven't had any issue. The charger box is super convenient since you can get a couple additional charges from the one box without having to go back and plug it in.The box is also supposed to charge wirelessly which is a great option, although my charger seems to have issues with it but so does my phone so I think that's more my wireless charger. It does great on my partner's wireless charger and has had no issues. The initial pairing was also very simple. Like many other devices I simply had to search for it on my phone and out of the box it automatically went into pairing mode which I know for previous Bluetooth devices that I've used sometimes is a hassle to get into pairing mode but not with this one
Overall I'm very satisfied with this headset and definitely would recommend it to others."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-20,Super compact ear buds that fit like a charm,I really like how well these fit in my ears. They're quite compact and the sound quality is great.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Competitively priced headphones with premium sound,these headphones were great. i was able to pair them with my phone within minutes and the battery lasts the entire workout. The great part is that they don't fall out of your ear when you lay down. Also when you're running they stay in your ear and you don't have to worry about getting loose. They sound really good too.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-21,Excellent headphones!,"Excellent headphones! These are my first pair of true wireless earbuds, so I don't have much to compare them to. However, I will say the sound quality is far beyond any pair of budget earbuds I've ever used. The build is also rugged and the connection is strong and consistent. I can get nearly a full work week out of these things before I need to charge the case. Can't beat these for the money!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-21,Great Find!,Love these earbuds! Great price and arrived quickly. Easy set up and easy to use. Have had others. None compare to these mid priced earbuds. Comfortable in the ears. Sounds better than some of the more expensive ones I've heard. Just get them!

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Good quality and easy to fit in ear,Great sound quality and feels good in my ears. They don’t fall out even if I’m jumping around. There are three sizes of earbuds (the part that sits in your ear) so they fit both me and my mom when she wants to borrow them. Great quality for less than half price of apple headphones
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Great price and quality!,Totally satisfied with purchase.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-22,"Good sound quality, significant delay","The sound quality is quite good, and fit is snug. Though, in some intense workouts it almost falls out. Range isn't very good and there is a significant audio delay when watching videos. However, I'll admit it could be my phone that is causing the problem. The range is quite short, walking across the house causes it to drop signal. Otherwise, the sound is good and easy to use. First set of ear buds and for the price these are very good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,gym ready,they are comfortable great for when i run and go to the gym
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Good gift for husband,My husband loves it. It is a perfect gift for him! He said it's better than the old cheap earbud I bought him. He likes that both earbuds connect at the same time and the sounds quality is good. Hopefully this will last. I'll update this post in a month.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Great Product,Definitely one of the better wireless Earbuds out there for the price
EarFun,Free,4,0,2020-04-20,Great for the price and great customer service,"For the price, these headphones are great. They deliver as they advertise. They are not as loud as other earbuds I have used, but the noise cancellation is pretty good. I am by no means a music expert and mostly use them for radio and podcasts, but when I do listen to music, I have no complaints at all with the sound. I have had some issue with the volume de-synchronizing between the earbuds, but the customer service sent me a list of detailed troubleshooting tips that fixed the disparity in volume. The issue comes back once in a while, but when I follow the steps sent to me, I can fix it quickly. The battery lasts long enough for my needs, and the earbuds charge quickly in their case. The USB-C and wireless charging is a great plus for me too. Also, there is an 18 month warranty, which is fantastic especially considering the price. I was a bit worried as I did not have any experience with this brand, but the warranty and good customer service eased my nerves."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Great purchase,"So easy to use, great sound and socomfortable! Cant beat the price and super happy with the purchase!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Good value for money,"Great value, works great. Good range for the bluetooth, comfortable to wear"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,"Good price, good sound, good comfort","These wireless earbuds deliver good sound and great battery life. They paired up to my phone easily the first time. They are comfortable to wear and have a start/stop button that makes it easy to stop when you're interrupted. I like to listen to audio books, and these deliver good clear sound. I recommend highly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Great bluetooth headset,"Like the first reviewer said, I think JLab hit a home run with this one ☝️ I just got my today and fresh out of the box they were halfway charged and ready to go. Sound quality is clear but bass heavy without playing with the EQUALIZER settings. The best sound for me is the factory setting they call signature sound. The fit is very comfortable and the earbuds are very light in my ears. Although I did use the larger size ear tips as I like to seal out as much of the outside world as possible. Connectivity is rock solid so far and they can get pretty loud too. But for $50 bucks you really can’t go wrong at this price for what you’re getting. I just ordered the Earin M-2 for $250 and I’m praying that they’re at least on the same level of sound quality that these are. Well I hope this review was helpful in making your next purchase for wireless earbuds"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Great value!,"Exactly like other reviews have stated - the quality is impressive for the price, the sound was surprisingly good, and they were easy to use after getting paired to devices for the first time. The case charges wirelessly very quickly, and the fit is good which helps keep out other noise."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Get these earbuds!,They work great. I really like thatI can wear them independently.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,GREAT PRODUCT,I thoroughly enjoy this product! Great value! Wonderful fit...
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Works Great!,Works great. Easy to use. No problems.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-22,"Great sound and comfort, but mine developed problems.","Sound great, very comfortable, and good battery life. However, the pair I received eventually stopped working properly. The sound output in one earbud dropped drastically, making them unusable. Since the return window had passed, I reached out to customer service, who provided troubleshooting ideas. When those steps failed, they sent a replacement pair. The new pair developed the same problem as the originals, so they again sent a replacement pair, which also failed after two weeks. Ultimately, the company provided a refund. I may have had issues with the product, but my customer service experience was excellent. They responded promptly, appropriately, and ultimately made sure I was satisfied."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Beyond Awesome,Awesome product
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Good quality,Enjoying it so far!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Well made and an excellent price!,As a newbie to earbuds I am very happy with these. The sound quality is good and they stay in my ears pretty well (I am still getting used to them). They make my daily walks more enjoyable.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Clear voice,It’s so happy. It’s very easy to use. It’s also very convenient to pack. It’s exquisite. It’s also not careful.There’s nothing wrong with it.With it.What’s most surprising is the sound quality. It’s so good.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Happy with my purchase!,"So I lost my old pair and was really bummed, so I bought these. I actually like these better, because they cancel sound really well but I can still hear enough of my surroundings that I won't get hit by a car while biking. They can be used separately too, if you don't want to wear both. Super easy to pair and use the function buttons."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-23,"If you like bass, get these!","First thing I want to say, is these have amazing bass! My wife has a pair of bluetooth earbuds and I wanted a pair of earbuds too without spending that much, and boy am I glad I got these. They are missing some of the clarity and highs, but I personally listen to a lot of bass heavy EDM music and these are perfect. They also cancel noise better than other earbuds I have tried. Battery life was pretty good too, although I didn't time how long they lasted."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Great value wireless buds,Excellent value for what you get. The fit is very good and comes with lots of tips. The sound is very good. Sweat is no problem for these. The battery life is great and the case has a small footprint. Charges fast. Very good overall.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-24,My Daughter loves these!,"My daughter has been begging me for the Apple earpods but I just cant afford it. I tried a competitive brand around Christmas but they fell out of her ears and she hated them - sorta ruined Christmas. I took a shot on these because of good reviews and I'm glad I did. The worksed right out of the box without a hitch. More importantly, they stay in her ears and also have great battery life. Five stars!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-24,Happy earfun !,"The sound is really good quality, they are very handful, easy to carry. The battery is good, I haven't needed to charge them yet and I’ve have them for a week with frequent use. The size is perfect for my ears."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-24,Didn't last long,The left earbud stop being loud after less than a month.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-24,Problem with left earbud,They worked great for about a week and then I noticed problems with the left earbud. It does not charge properly and dies a lot faster than the right.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-24,"great value, great features","Two pair in our house, we love em. Only caveat, if you want to wear these to bed and are a side sleeper, i'll say my ears ended up sore from the hard nugget shape of the earbud that extends out enough to have pillow pressure on it. My ear was sore so thats the only warning, if you are a side sleeper. Otherwise,thumbs up. Nice quality feel to them! ."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-24,Sounds quality,Amazing earbuds i have several pair of wireless earbuds this is my favorite for sound quality and battery life. I love the charging case it is very small and compact will keep the lid closed so I don't need to worry it will fall out.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-24,Good for the price,Good set of earbuds for the price. Personally I wish the sound was a bit louder. Can’t compare to more expensive AirPods or similar.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-24,Excellent ear buds!,This is a great product! Excellent fit and seamless connection. Customer service is spot on too. We ordered 2 and will probably consider these for next years Christmas gifts.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-25,Solid for the price point,Not bad for the price just didn’t feel comfortable in my ear. After using them on a confrence call my ear was a bit sensitive. Gave them 4 star because the price is great for the quality of the product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Great product,"It exceeded my expectation. Sound quality, building quality, design are all there. Why spend more then $200? Strongly recommended it!"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-25,Battery life is awful. Everything else is great.,"For the first few weeks of use the battery life was great. After a while, though, it was rare for the earbuds to last more than a half hour without dying, even when I had JUST taken them out of the case, which was fully charged. Everything else about the earbuds is great, but what’s the point of good sound quality or noise cancellation if they don’t stay charged long enough to even use them? Annoying and a waste of money."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Great product for a great price!,Very awesome ear buds for a great price! They do NOT move around when you are running or working out and moving around. The sound quality is amazing and the charge life has been great so far!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Best $40 you will spend,"Wow for the money these are great. The sound is good the battery life is good but that is just the beginning. The other day my lovely wife decided to do some wash. Well these were a n the pocket. She was SO SORRY. I was a little upset but hey there only $40 no need to get that upset. I told her I would let them dry out and see if they worked. She again said I am SO SORRY they went through the dryer too. That kinda makes sense. Well I left them outside on a hot day and guess what. One is still working, the case is is still changing it and it sounds good too. I would have ordered these again because they were good but they are good enough I wanted to share with EVERYBODY these things are GREAT!! !"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Great buy for the money,"I tried another set of earbuds but couldn't get them to pair right -- sound would come out of only one ear. The Earfun paired immediately just by taking them out of the charger. They fit comfortably in my ear and don't fall out -- just one time in dozens of miles of walking so far, with an occasional jog to cross streets or maintain a six-foot separation from others. The sound is good. I usually listen to audiobooks while I walk, but the times I've listened to music, it seems just fine to me too (though I'm not real picky about that). The noise cancelling is okay unless I'm near a busy street but there aren't many of those during times of social distancing. For the price, I think these are a great buy. Even extreme audiophiles might like them, but definitely anyone who falls below that level will be very happy with these earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Awesome,"The sound quality really exceeds my imagination! !The materials and workmanship are very good,easy to wear,no matter when working or exercising,don’t worry about the headphones falling."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-25,Not the best,"There is virtually no bass in these earbuds. The sound is mediocre, even for the value. That being said, the battery life on these was really good. Not sure if some of these reviews are purchased, or if some people received a higher quality product than others. I would go with another brand personally"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Nice product,"Excellent product, highly recommended"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Great wireless earbuds!,"First impression, the case and the packaging looks very nice. The earbuds are kinda bulky in size but fits well in the ear. Sound quality is very good, very crisp sound and has good amount of bass too. Battery LIFE IS AMAZING and it last for days. I love the fact that I can just charge it wirelessly, it's very convenient. I'd definitely recommend this product!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Better than I expect,"I think design of this earbuds is gorgeous due to both affordable price and quality. Normally, I don’t like big buds, so I chose earfun’s earbuds because they don’t seem big and look very pretty on my ear. Besides, buds fit my ears very well and I don’t face any problem like falling out from my ears. Buds have the changeable different colour lights, which allow me know whether my earbuds is paired or charging. Each bud has a button, which let me adjust the level of volume, taking on a call or pass to other songs. It is more compatible. I paired it with my phone easily. I can talk far away from almost 15 meters without any connection problem. Especially, the sound quality is satisfying. I used my apple wired earphone before this product. I really love to listen to music with this earbuds. In addition, its microphone is really good as well as my old earbuds. Noise cancellation is working well. The volume of microphone is really as good as my old earbuds. I didn’t encounter any problem with its microphone. The battery of the product is better than I expect. I am using it almost every day since one week. I received the product with full charge and I used it higher than 6 hours for first time. The case has a Type C, so I charged the case for almost 2.5 hours. I can use earbuds nearly 7 hours without putting in the case for charge. In addition, I charged the earbuds for five times with a full charge case. The case of the earbuds is small, so I carry it in my pocket easily. The case has lights that represent level of the battery."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Quality Earbuds,Great quality earbuds for the price. Sound was noise cancellation was great. Definitely worth buying another set.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Awesome,Sound really good and clear
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-26,Not good sound quality,"Wouldn’t recommend these, my phone speaker is louder than this I still can hear tv in the background with my volume all the way up. I don’t know where all these good reviews came from, saying is a good sound."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Some times the tooth that is blue is the way to go!,"The sound quality of this Bluetooth headset is pretty good, they feel great in my ear and they last a extremely long time compared to my last set of earbuds!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Good sound with wireless charging case,Wireless charging is a useful addon to this pair of buds. Good sound quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Great Earbuds and better customer service,These earbuds are comfortable and had been working great. I then had an issue where one was not working at all. After sending a super easy request for service I received an email with some instructions to try and fix it and it works. Amazing prompt customer service speaks volumes to me and is greatly appreciated. Great product and customer service
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Great quality.,"Love this earbuds, it's good quality and worth it. My old earbuds was broken and I've always wanted to buy a good one to replace it. This product is just what I want. I'm satisfied."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-26,Do not buy,Nothing works right had several sent to me worked differently and all had problems
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Great earbuds without breaking the bank!,"Order these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. When able a opportunity arises to use them, she has them in her ear quickly."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,I will be getting another pair,These are a great substitute for the rediculously expensive ones. It fits in my ears perfectly. The sound is great. My son even loves them. They come charged and ready to use. The case is perfect for them so you don’t lose them and I keep them in my purse. Great value for the price
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-27,Starter Wireless Headphones,"I bought these headphones back in mid-January 2020. They were used moderately, about 4-5 hours during weekdays. Pretty happy with them for a while. They fit nicely to my ear, lightweight, and had a great noise cancellation. I have big ears, so they were low profile, and the ability to control fast forward/rewind from the buds is useful. I did have some ear irritation after prolonged use, but that might just be me. NOW. End of April, they work at best 20 mins before they start this warbling/static and are unusable. It seems like the casing was done well, but the inner tech less so. This was my first set of wireless headphones and I had to prove to myself that I was responsible enough for them. Move forward, I'd rather get something better made by a better company. Some friends have had airpods for over a year without an issue. So, dish out the money upfront, it'll be worth it in the long run. (Generously saying End of April. It was more End of February. A week into March it started, and then Covid hit and I generally stopped using them.) In summary:
Cheap wireless headphones that are great for short time use. Great for kids or teens if they want them, and aren't responsible for a better brand. But if you're an adult and want headphones to last you at least 6 months, look elsewhere."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-27,"Sent Back, really weren't nosie cancelling or comfortable.","got these to replace my older Blue Tooth ear pieces, i was surprised that they were not comfortable and did not stay in the ears....so i returned them"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Worth it to buy!,Good quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Best product I've found for small ears,"These are a great pair of true wireless earbuds that work great for both Apple and Android devices. The case charges using USB C, so it charges up pretty quick and holds about four charges per ear, which is great. Additionally, the case doubles up as a portable battery, so you can charge your phone while charging your earbuds or using them. Additionally, these are quite comfortable and come with extra ear tips to accommodate different ear types and the one-touch controls are quite convenient to easily regulate the device and perform commands."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-27,"works great, but left earbud won't work","I really enjoyed these headphones, but sadly the left one stopped working after 3 weeks. I was very disappointed and missed the deadline to get a refund. They worked great and I was very pleased when I got them, but only the right earbuds will connect and play."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-27,Nice price good sound quality,"I returned the device because it didn't fit properly in the ear, there were no smaller ear pieces included"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,This is a great wireless headset,"I had a good earphone before, but unfortunately he lost it.But I like sports, so I need a headset that can listen to music when I exercise, and a headset that can answer the phone when I drive.This headset met all my needs, and the sound quality was excellent, giving me the same feeling as the previous one."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Great product !!,"These sound great and look great, and being water proof is is a plus, they paired with my phone quickly, just one click, i'm impressed."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,No noise,The headset is very comfortable to wear. It is mainly used for making calls. It sounds very clear and there is no noise . This time I am very satisfied with the shopping.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Best in class!!!,Really amazing product. Noise cancellation is perfect and sound quality is amazing. Highly recommended.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,They're very comfortable with an exceptioinal battery life,"I like to listen to music when I run, and boy have I been running through my wireless earbuds (pun intended). These ones however have been faring quite well! The main issue that I usually run into (pun intended again) is battery life. Most earbuds die too early, or after a while they don't hold the charge as well. But these ones are very affordable, so if I need to replace them it's not that big of a deal. Aside from that they are very comfortable to wear. With all the sweating and constant motion when running sometimes my earbuds slip out or just feel very uncomfortable when I'm wearing them. These ones however haven't given me any issues. I sometimes forget they're actually in my ears haha. I wear them all the time now as a matter of fact, not just working out. The sound quality is very good and the noise cancelling is very good too! I really enjoy wearing them at the office where I sometimes need to drown out the sound coming from the other employees. All in all, they get the job done and sound really good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Good sound quality,"The quality of the headphones is very good,the sound quality is very good,the endurance is very strong , and it is easy to carry around."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Impressive sound,These earbuds are amazing I was very impressed with the sound quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,high quality,"This is a great product. It's easy to hear a call. The sound quality of music, video and calls is very clear. I really like the different choices of headphones provided by these headphones. It really makes you find the perfect choice."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-28,Great product but lacks comfort and looks odd in ears,Everything about these was pretty good for the price. But i couldnt get past how they actually looked inside my ear and the discomfort of them within the first hour. 2 major flaws that arent worth buying over in my opinion
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Great fit and easy connect,"I really like these and just ordered a second pair because my wife stole my first pair. My only gripe is that the second time I ordered the price had gone up to $49 from $36 the week before. The fit great, you forget they are in until someone is tapping your shoulder because you cant hear them"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,"Noise cancellation, clear sound, good water resistance.","Bluetooth headset with a luxurious, eye-catching design. Suitable for many phone devices, ipad, computer. Vivid sound, noise cancellation. In addition, there are a variety of earpads for smoother wearing."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-28,Great! Buy them.,Stop looking at other buds. These are the ones. Click add to cart. Do it.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Great sound quality and noise cancellation,These wireless earbuds are extremely function for their price. The sound quality is amazing and doesn't have static even if you walk a far distance from your device. It also has great noise cancellation and allows me to listen to my music without being interrupted by other loud noises.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Hat mich gefreut 👌👌,"It is an amazing product. I am using it during my Gym training. & I astonished that it is very comfortable. It's light weight and main thing not fall out from your ears. Also, Sound quality is awesome. The most highlighted feature is it's sensor response You can easily access it through sensor button on earbuds. It looks very cool & stylish. I am fully satisfied with this product."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Highly recommended,There is nothing I can complain about Earfun earbuds. Outstanding quality. Keep up the good work!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Love them,Love them!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Technology at its finest!!,"This pair of tiny earbuds are simply amazing. Yes, I have finally found Bluetooth earbuds that do not have any wires and are not heavy on my head like headphones can be. It is unbelievable how long one charge lasts. The quality of sound that comes out of these small things blows my mind. I know that there's a lot of choices as far as earbuds go but I think this company has finally figured out how to perfect this is an essential piece of equipment. Thanks so much!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Comfortable and best value for price,"There are many earbuds out there both above and below value. The box it comes in is a little bit bigger than other earbuds boxes I have received but is much nicer as well. It is tightly packed in foam so you know it wont get damaged. The ear pieces are neatly arranged in a plastic case so you do not have to try and match individual sizes. The ear pieces are a little bigger and heavier then other earbuds but it comes with a nicer volume and bass. They fit comfortably and never once did I feel like it was going to fall out while on my runs. I have used this for a week straight and so far never had to charge it. Battery life seems very long. These earbuds look very slick, case has a nice simple design, and no problems right out of the box. This feels like an above value item at a lower price."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-29,Worth it,"I bought this for my friend. Auto power on is a good feature in it. . He likes it . He owns an iPhone 11 max he told me it has nice cancelation ,good bass. Earbuds activate siri too. It can be charged through wireless charger too. Comes with 3 size of eartips with it. Has a good notice cancelation. One charge can give backup for more than a whole day . My friend just love this product."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-29,Not canceling noise,I'm getting a lot of complaints from phone callers that they hear wind on phone calls so that means it's not canceling noise. Its great for listening to music but not for phone calls I do a lot of talking so this product isn't good for me. I like the fit the battery life but the noise cancelling isn't good at all I'm sorry
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-08-07,Solid Buds,Great clean sound- really pronounced bass. Easing paring and just a great pair of buds for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-07,Happy and satisfied,Love them good quality sound and long-lasting no need to charge till you get home
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-08,Not too big. Sounds good. USB-C,"Just what I was looking for. Surprisingly, it was hard looking for a pair of USB-C and WHITE true wireless earbuds, but after looking around on Amazon I finally stumbled upon this brand. Sounds greats, feels great and the case isnt as big as some other brands. Awesome"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-19,Nice,"The package is really nice. I personally would love to receive this a a gift. The charging box is the lightest (weight) I ever seen, it shows on the outside how the battery is (4 white light dots). It comes with 3 sizes to adjust on the ear (small, medium and large). The controls are simple. Easy to use. Sound quality is good. In the video is possible to have a better idea on its size."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-08-21,Great sound!,Easy to pair with my phone and charge last a long time. Very satisfied!
EarFun,Free,5,0,2019-08-25,Great sound! Great price!,"Just got these in today, and I’m very impressed. The sound is amazing. The volume is good for me and fit is very comfortable with the right tips on them. The call quality was good, the mic was a little low but came in clear. I would definitely check these out"
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-09-03,Sound quality is outstanding. Bad battery and case won't charge in case.,"The sound quality is great I have no complains there, however they have a problem charging you can leave them over night charging and the battery will at 40 or dead. They should be charging but they don't charge in the case, if you leave them over night they should be charged not drained if their in the case. This is my second pair and I've had the same issues."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-08,Good sound with good bass! Medium-sized case,"Some other reviews say that these don't have much bass. That's not my experience at all! I'm a basshead, and these definitely scratch that itch for me. The case on these is pretty good too. The magnets are strong and the lights are responsive. I don't love that you can only use tips that aren't very deep (since they preclude the earbud from touching the charging contacts if the eartips are too big), since I like to use different eartips. The stock ones are pretty good but a bit shallow for me. I was able to find some slightly taller (deeper) ones that both fit in the case and fit the earbud, but my preferred tips pushed the earbud too far out of the case. I own another pair of earbuds in this price range (MPOW T5), which are excellent, but I'd say these are on par. The sound is very similar. The fit of the other ones is slightly better for me (it's deeper), but I think that'll vary between people. The case on this one is definitely better (much sleeker). The only weird/bad thing I've noticed is that when these are in mono mode (right side only), only the left channel plays (yes, in the right earbud). That's probably not an issue that a lot of people will have a problem with ..."
EarFun,Free,4,0,2019-09-08,Great earbuds,The Bluetooth connection isn't stable on mine causing music to cut out every once in a while. The sound is great on my oluv edition. The battery life is great and lasts for a long time.
EarFun,Free,4,0,2019-09-08,Truly wireless stereo earbuds with Bluetooth 5 connectivity at a bargain price,"For ultimate freedom to listen to tunes or engage in incoming phone calls, the latest must-have accessory is “true wireless” earbuds. As the name suggests, there are no external wires holding the buds to each other, or to the sending device, or to the wearer. This set from EarFun is a good example of the current state of the art for affordable true wireless technology. The Bluetooth 5 standard is finally available on low-priced wireless products and is present here. Its range (from the earbuds to the sending device) is slightly better than similar products running Bluetooth 4.2. Using the EarFun earbuds, I can go one room away from my iPhone and still get a strong Bluetooth connection, but not two. Supposedly B5 can manage more data and transfer it more quickly. Music and voice are not sufficiently data-intensive to benefit from this improvement – that will have to wait for a video product. But the process of pairing and remembering paired devices, which could be frustrating on Bluetooth 4.2 and 4.0 devices, was quick and easy with these earbuds. That’s impressive, seeing as each needs to receive a wireless signal. The earbuds themselves are nicely formed devices, rounded and shaped to fit snugly inside the ear. Rather than buttons, the user presses on the outer membrane of the eartips to make adjustments. Fit is paramount, because having one fall out and get lost during your morning jog can ruin your whole day. To minimize the possibility of losing them, three sizes of eartips are provided. My medium-sized ears were happy with the medium sized eartips. Are they really waterproof? I was too chicken to drop them in the sink – the prospect of doing something like that is verboten to anyone who uses mobile technology. A good approach for avoiding loss: When not in your ears, EarFun’s earbuds should be in their charging case. The case contains a battery that charges the buds when they are inserted. (Be sure you match the buds with their respective pockets.) The case is small enough to reside in your pocket, and always putting your earbuds in the case will reduce the likelihood of misplacing them. You should get around three full charges of the earbuds from the case. At home, plug the case via its included micro USB cable into your USB charging station. The EarFun people seem to have thought of everything when they came up with this true wireless earbud package. The buds’ volume could go a little higher. It’s okay for a quiet room, but a bit underpowered for a bike ride. The engineers at Bose won’t be kept awake nights trying to match the audio quality, but it is acceptable for this price range. Voice quality, sending and receiving, is decent. And it’s easy to use for catching incoming calls. The packaging is first-rate and the documentation is a cut above the norm at this price point. All in all, a good value."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-09,Comfort and sound quality on point,"I love listening to music, watching videos, or just listening to podcasts to pass time. I do have a collection of headphones and earbuds, so from that, I can easily say which ones are bad and good. I bought this earbuds for one main reason, it's white. All of my headphones and earbuds are black, so this would be a great addition in my daily rotation. Here are some of my thoughts:
First thing that I noticed is how the earbuds fits very nicely to my ears (not all ears are same). It is very comfortable and fit is perfect that it drowns out all the ambient noise. In my opinion, $50 is the sweet spot for ""you get what you pay for"". These earbuds have amazing sound quality. I also own earbuds above the $100 range, and yet these earbuds have almost the same sound quality as the expensive ones. The highs are just right, the mids and the bass are a little bit emphasized which gives these earbuds a unique sound signature. In layman's terms, the sound is awesome. For the battery life, I've been using this in the gym for 2 hours, and battery level is still at 90%, so if this could last up to 5 hours, that's more than enough for me. I usually don't use earbuds for more than 3 hours anyways. The case promises additional 24 hours of battery, well, that's more than enough for my 2 weeks worth of gym time. Overall, I was surprised how good these earbuds are. It looks really nice in white color. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this anyone who is on a limited budget. Great buy."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-14,Good product and price definitely recommend,These are really good for the price. I actually didn’t expect them to sound this well. They can get pretty loud. I have not had any issues with them falling out when I put them in either. I did have a little trouble getting both of them to work initially. I contacted the seller and they told me to unpair them then hold both earbuds down for 8 secs then shut them off put them back in the charging dock then take them out and they worked perfect. My initial problem was not being able to get the left to pair up. When i followed the insurrections given they finally paired up and sound great. I do love that they can be wirelessly charged too.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-09-16,Good earbuds,"Good sound quality with good bass. Buttons are a bit hard to press. Case is small, which is great to carry around in your pocket. The earbuds are a bit bigger than others."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-18,Best sound from wireless earbuds that I've heard!,"These headphones are excellent! They're a little bigger than normal wireless earbuds but that allows them more room for drivers. Sound - The sound quality of these buds is exceptional. Rich low ends, kicking mids and clear highs all come through on these. Battery - The battery life is awesome as well. I've been using them several hours a day consistently for about a week and I haven't had to charge the case at all - in fact, the indicator light for the case still shows a full charge. I haven't reached the limit on how long the buds last on a charge but I'll update if I hit it. Connection / Setup - Connection couldn't have been easier. Pop them out, search for BT devices on your phone and connect. The connection has always been very solid as I've been using them - haven't experienced any dropouts. Fit / Comfort - As I mentioned, these are a bit bigger than other wireless earbuds. That works perfectly for me since I've got pretty big ears. Not sure how it would work with someone with smaller ears. I wear them for several hours at a time without any discomfort. They seal out ambient noise very well too - again, probably at least partially due to the bigger size."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-21,Amazing!,A quality product for an adorable price. I very much recommend this product.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-09-28,They are huge and stick out a bunch.,These might sound good and have USB c and wireless charging but they don't fit my ears the way I want. They feel huge when I wear them. I rather have something smaller.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-09-29,Rock Out,These headphones are awesome. They provide good sound quality as well. Three noise cancelling feature is pretty good as well. Should is crisp and clean. I would recommend these for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-03,Good for the money!,They cut out if there are a lot of other wireless headphones around. For example the gym. But fantastic otherwise
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-05,Great quality and sound,These little buds are awesome and stay put
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-06,Malos,Se dañan a los dias
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-09,Good budget earbuds,These earbuds sound great for the price and have good range. Great customer service. Only downfall is that the microphone picks up alot of ambient noise.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-20,so happy i bought these and not airpods!,"i’ve been using these for about a week and they’re perfect! i love the wireless charging case. i like how the earbuds come with different size rubber pieces that go in your ear. they pair seamlessly. i did have an issue when i first used these because i didn’t realize the right earbud was the control one. i reset them and they work fine now. they connect to my iphone easy and i haven’t had to charge them at all yet. i don’t use them fairly often (~1hr a day) but i’m happy that there is no cord and they’re sleek and slim. i will update if i have any issues. the ONLY thing i don’t like is the kid feels kind of flimsy. there is a magnet that holds the lid closed, but it’s a tiny bit loose and wiggly. i hope that this won’t be an issue and don’t foresee it being one but it’s just something i had to note."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-21,"Very Pleasing to my Eyes, Good Design and Sounds Fair",I am using this for my daily commute and it does an OK job blocking out the noise. The sound quality is great and the case being a wireless charger works well for me. This would have been a perfect 5 stars if these were precision touch controls.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-10-22,Solid runner up comparing these with more expensive buds but I found a pair that were better!,Compared to a pair of Mozart branded TWS off amazon i got last year and the M&D MW07 these have comparable sound and bass but way better battery life along with IPX7. Love that they are waterproof and work in the shower flawlessly. However recently got a pair of Cepekyy TWS-H01 to compare because there was a 40% coupon and they have touch controls WITH volume control and they are significantly smaller so they are much more comfortable. The Cepekyy won me over with stronger bass and comfort so I will be returning these although they are pretty solid for the price!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-22,Small and Compact,The headphones are lightweight and the carrying case in light an compact to other pairs that I own. Charges fast
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-23,Super easy to setup and use,"I wanted earbuds that were wireless and easy to use. These are so easy to use, pairs up via Bluetooth quickly, no cables. Just put in your ears - very comfortable - and go."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-28,A+ Customer Support,Manufacturer has made things right. Happy customer.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-10-29,Great sound/great price!,"These are great for the price! Great sound and easy charging. I was doubtful, but figured I’d try them out since I didn’t want to spend over $100 on an Apple paid. I’m satisfied with my purchase."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-10-31,For knockoff it’s ok,"It’s of course knockoff , sound quality is not the best"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-02,Nice high quality BT earbuds,"Pleased with the packaging, design, and sound quality of the bt earpods. Easy to pair and comes with 3 sets of earpads to accommodate different sizes of the ear canal for more effective noise cancellations. Sound quality is good if not better than the competitors but the difference comes down the design and shape of the units themselves."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,Great Commuting Headphones,"With the rise in popularity of other name brand wireless headphones I decided to jump on the bandwagon. It's so handy that they charge in their case and it seems that they hold their battery life for a super long time before needing to recharge. The only thing, which isn't to the fault of the product is that it's sort of easy to loose an earbud and not have any way to track it down. Other than that they have a great sound and the way they fit in your ears keeps outside noise out even on busy subways."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-06,Fantastic!,"Everything about these are great! Good sound quality and base, good battery life, and every bit as good as airpods for way cheaper"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-07,Could not speak more highly,"These earbuds are awesome! They cancel noise, have great sound quality and look great on. I love that they are chordless and very well made. I definitely would recommend these to a friend."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-11-08,Broke within 2 weeks,It was 2 weeks after I got them the right one went went out then a week after that the left one went out these things are not worth $50
EarFun,Free,4,1,2019-11-10,Good quality headphones,Ok Bluetooth 5.0 headphones for the price. This was the cheapest I found of this style that had wireless charging. Sound quality is ok for the price. The silicone buds are not very comfortable after extended use.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-11-12,bad connection,These were terrible. Lost connection constantly.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-12,DEADLY HEADPHONES! GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE THOUGH!!!,"Update: the customer service for EarFun is amazing and contacted me directly with their concerns. They apologized profusely and gave me the opportunity to try out their over ear head phones which have A++ sound quality and noise isolation. These headphones are deadly. I’ve always been hesitant to try Bluetooth headphones without wires but the reviews were great so I bought them. But just as I thought, at my first visit to the gym, they fell out twice during HIIT. Which I thought okayyyy, but then after a few minutes on the treadmill my right headphone popped out and flew down. So I paused my run, jumped down, grabbed it, and jumped back up only to HIT MY HEAD ON THE ARMREST of my treadmill. Honestly saw little stars and thought I was gonna be concussed!!! I had to check my head to make sure it was just sweat and not blood. Returned them immediately. If you got a Different ear shape than EarFun assumes, don’t get these deadly contraptions! !"
EarFun,Free,2,0,2019-11-13,"Earbud Charging issues in case, too loose constantly tries to connect to Bluetooth on phone","I bought the EarFun Free from the Indiegogo campaign. I really want to love these, but I've had issues with the charging and storing of the buds. I use the large silicon tips that came with them. The buds are too loose in the case. While in the case they don't stay connected to charge and are contently connecting to my phone. I get so frustrated that I have to turn off the blue tooth on my phone. I have to work the earbuds in the case until the charging starts and pray that they stay charging when I set the case down. Now for the sound, fit in my ears, and phone calls, I love them for these earbuds. I have not tested the water proof ability."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-15,Good value.,I have used the headphones while running and in the shower. The headphones stayed in my ears without having to be readjusted. Truly waterproof. A few times the sound has modulated causing a momentary difference in volume between ears. The noise cancelling works very well so be aware of your surroundings when outdoors. For the price I am happy with my purchase.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-17,Comfortable and great sound quality,I loved the design and vibrant sound quality. Charging case was amazing too. I use these daily at work as the co working space has a lot of noise. This effectively isolates sound and provides hours of great listening! Comfortable weight and shape for hours of use.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-11-24,Battery does not last after 3 months!,Works great in the beginning but battery did not last !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-11-30,Earbuds with beautiful white design,"I bought white earbuds, the quality is awesome. Best part is it fits in my ear exactly what i was looking for. Paired it with my iphone and it was way quick. Voice quality and beats are smooting for ears. Must buy if you wana get in this budget."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-09,Great Quality Sound,"I was a little hesitant about purchasing Eafun earbuds, after receiving them I notice how great the package was. It was really easy to sync with my device. Sound is amazing, clear, very sharp sound and the noise cancellation is top notch. The wireless charging is a great option. I'll be taking them on my upcoming flight next week. I was very impress with how comfortable they feel around your ear. I know what some of my friends are getting for Xmas this year. Great Product."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-10,Pretty darn good product,Bargain priced great sound. Noise cancellation is so good that it puts me in another world and I can’t hear my family yell at me so I’m very satisfied.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-11,"Good quality, sturdy, sounds good","works very well, pairs very well. in and out of the case it pairs immediately. Battery lasts long. Not a noise cancelling earphone but I can barely hear anything from outside due to its snug fit. Pairing is easy, I was a little confused initially but its not at all finicky. Tip: Right is master, so while taking out the earphones take out right first and then left. So right pairs immediately by the time you set up both in ears. I would rather buy 3-4 of these and use them for workout stressfree compared to Apple and Bose. Also, while running you wont hear the noise of steps."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2019-12-11,Good for the price with some caveates,Good for the price but really wish the left bud worked separate from the right. Sound quality is great but have had issues with the bud not sitting properly in the case despite the case being closed. Because it isn't sitting properly it sometimes connects to my phone when the case is shut which interferes with other Bluetooth devices I may already be connected too. That being said I think it's worth the price for good sounding truly wireless earbuds. Using it for phone calls is ok - not horrible - not amazing but decent for what I paid.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-13,Very good earbud.,"Very good earbud. I like it very much as it fits my ear very well. The battery last for a long time, probably more than 48 hours. The most fanscinating thing is there is a button to control the song for pausing or restarting. Really a good earbud."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-13,Cheap and worth it,Very awesome set of wireless earbuds for the price. At a third of the price of last gen airpods these things honestly rock. The sound quality is pretty mediocre. But I am able to use these 7+ hours a day at least 3 days a week and only find my self charging the case every weekend or so.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Awesome TWS!,This is a really great wireless earbud! Sounds great and never loses connection!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,The best!,I own a set of AirPods as well and these are so much more comfortable and sound extremely well. I have recommended these to everyone I know.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,Audio,"A pleasant surprise for the price, works well listening to audio books and avoiding unwanted conversations."
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-14,Buen sonido pero con fallos,La protección contra el agua no sirve como lo presumen.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-14,A perfect choice,The bass of the earphones is amazing and undoubtedly its an add on to your style. The battery backup is pretty good and they are really comfortable in use. I will highly recommend the product
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-15,Awesome price for an awesome earbuds,I like the design and the fit.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-16,Gorgeous,"My niece is all into white.. white everything. Minimalist white is the new hot thing apparently. I have been looking for non apple bluetooth capable headphones in all white. This fit the bill. I have no idea if they work, how easily they pair to phones, how the sound is or how the battery life is. What I can say is that these headphones are packaged like a quality set and make a gorgeous gift. This presentation is top notch, the headset looks beautiful and the set packs up in a very pocket friendly sized battery charging case. My niece is always on the go so I am very impressed that these are also waterproof. After Christmas, I can update this review once she gives me feedback."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-17,Amazing sound quality and battery life.,"These are great true wireless earbuds with amazing sound quality and battery life for the price, and it also includes USB C and even wireless charging case."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-19,Good headphones.,They are really waterproof I dropped one them in the water and it still works.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-20,Si,It’s actually impressive. In battery life. But as for everything else. Price speaks for itself but surprisingly the sounds is great and same with base
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-21,Very satisfied!,"This is my first experience with true wireless ear buds. So far, the Ear Fun true wireless ear buds meet my expectations. The sound quality is very good and I like the long battery life. Be aware, the volume is controlled by your phone or other Bluetooth device. There is no volume control on the Ear Fun. The problem I have, and that would be with all ear buds is my large ear canals. The silicone tips don't work for me. I found other large memory foam ear tips that fit better. The ear buds are heavier than the other style listening devices that fit in the ear since they house the battery, etc. so the fit has to be snug and secure, otherwise they'll fall out."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-22,Easy to use... work great... sound great!!,Connect right away
EarFun,Free,2,1,2019-12-26,Charger stopped working on day one!,The earbuds themselves are fairly great. However the charger case didn't even last a day before it stopped working (no lights now and smells slightly of fried electronics). Hoping it's a fluke/replacement has been ordered but is delayed due to no stock. Would be great to just be able to get a replacement case.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-26,Awesome!,Awesome product! It stays charged for a long time! Great quality.
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-27,Returned!,I returned these because the connection to my phone wasn't good and the music was skipping. Also the eatbud themselves are kinda big. I had terrible flash backs to portable CD player and oversized headphones that didn't really work
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-28,Would not buy again,They're not very loud
EarFun,Free,5,1,2019-12-29,A little bit of a chunky boy,"The Good: Sound quality is not bad, no sharp s's, no background hissing noise. Pretty good noise cancelation with the sealing from the ear buds. Easy to charge without a wireless charger. The Bad: Bass isn't particularly heavy. The Ugly: A little bit of a chunky boy"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2019-12-30,Disappointing...,"When I got this product both earbuds worked, but days later one of the earbuds stopped working. The sound quality was poor too..it’s sounds like I’m using earphones from the 90s when I had a Walkman. I was disappointed that this product didn’t work for me, because the price point is amazing. I ended up returning these earbuds :("
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-01,Good value,Good product for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-01,"Perfect, except ...",Love these earbuds but only gave 4 stars because there’s no way to adjust volume without your phone. I like to increase volume depending on my workout. Small inconvenience though for a great set that fit very comfortably and securely.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-01,Pairing was a nightmare,"The sound quality and fit of these earbuds was very good for the quality, but getting the lady to pair to the right (master) was practically impossible. I was able to get it to work once and then could never get them to pair again after repeated attempts, carefully following the minimal instructions. Way too much trouble."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-01,"Good, efficient pair of earbuds","Liked the instant connection, once removed from the case. Good battery life."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-02,Size matters,"The sound quality is good and the battery life is long. However, the design is a bit big and bulky for regular size ears. The earpod easily falls out of my ear as it's too bulky and heavy to stay in."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-04,Very very great quality sound for the price,Love the design and quality of sound. Ordered another for my friend.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-05,Ns,Na
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-06,Solid construction materials.,"The construction of this earphones is solid. It feels like high quality. Even the instruction booklet is made of high quality paper. My wife says I look cool with it on my ears. Remember 20 years ago, most things were build to last forever (like more decade). This product makes me feel that way. I love it."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-06,"I’m kidding, they’re great apparently.","Gave these to my girlfriend for her birthday. They must have sounded really bad, because she broke up with me 2 days later."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-01-07,Brand new,"I received the delivery and I was very surprised because of the new degree of it. it looks new(full box) and while I was using it, it was easy to connect to my phone and the battery life is amazing long. And the model of it looks so so nice. Believe in me, when you look at the box of those headphones, you'll love it right away."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Worth every penny,"For the amount being payed, these are easily one of the best wireless earbuds out there. You can easily pay over $100 to even $200 on earbuds and most of them in the market do not offer an IPX rating of 7(waterproof), nor bluetooth 5.0 which is the highest bluetooth rating out there as of today. The sound quality when making phone calls is amazing. These earphones are really good at canceling noise, and sound amazing. Worth every penny, you get a lot more than expected. These are better than most overpriced wireless earbuds in the market."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Must have!!!,Great set of wireless pods.... especially for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-07,Great Value,Great value. Work perfectly.
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-08,"Does what it does, makes you look like you have hearing aida",My dislike is pure aesthetics with them in my ear.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,Charges wirelessly and that's rad,These are light water resistant earbuds that sound good in a workout. I use the smaller buds which are conveniently included with the kit. The wireless charging was a bonus since i hate carrying so many cables.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,good quality and comfort,i wanted a white pair of earbuds that were very comfortable and after giving these a try for a few hours i liked that it didnt irritate my ears and people could hear me great when i call
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-08,The Best Quality and Fit,"I got these Earfun Buds for my birthday. I play poker and have been looking for a good quality product that doesn't have wires. I have tried the apple earpods and returned them, the jaybird earbuds and returned them because they were not comfortable and the sound was not that great. Also, only 4 hours of listening. I get 6 hours of listening and a fully charged case for more hours if needed. I have eaten food with them in and they stay in. I love these Earfun Buds. Thanks hubby for a great birthday gift that is comfortable and good quality."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-09,Good sound quality,Came charged and ready to go. Good quality sound and long battery life
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-12,"Working great,",The earbuds connected quickly and produce outstanding sound. Haven't tried the waterproof feature but they stay in very well. Time will tell but I'm very pleased with this set.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-13,👍,👍
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Amazing Ear,"Best Sound Quality, Battery life is amazing."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-13,Glad these stay synched together!!,Had Toshiba ear buds before these abs was very disappointed by how I could never keep them synched together. These always seem to be synched together and have an excellent battery life. I was surprised to see it needed a usb type c to charge but luckily I had been buying charging cords with all 3 types of charger ends for some time. They’re no Bose but really good for the price.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-16,Above Average Sound But Connectivity Issues,"Heavy bass but not very crisp. Overall sound is better than most true wireless earbuds I've tried. However, main issue of annoyance is the intermittent connection problems! During a 30 minute span, there were probably 20-30 instances where half of a second would lose connection... meaning about 15 cumulative seconds during that span. It may not sound like a lot but when you're working out, it's distracting."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-16,Great ear buds,"The battery lasts a long time, I can't hear anything else outside the buds, and they have really great sound! My two complaints would have to be, I wish they were smaller, I'm using the smallest buds, and they are still too big. My 2nd complaint is the aesthetics, they are so boring to look at. I wish they would put a little work on the appearance of these buds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-18,Lo recomiendo!,Me gustaría que para una próxima edición los auriculares 🎧 sean más pequeños y con más opciones disponibles.
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-01-19,***UPDATED***Disappointed- haven't owned them a month yet :(,"I am very disappointed. My husband bought these Dec 22nd for my Xmas gift, and just this past Friday the charging case stopped working after I charged it. I love the quality of the earphones, but if the charging station doesn't last, I can't be 100% satisfied. I wish there was an option to purchase another charging station if and when this happens. ***UPDATE*** I heard from the seller, and their solution to me is to send me a used pair of headphones....I didn't even have BRAND NEW buds for a month, but they want to send me USED ones?!?! No thanks. I asked for my husband's money back...."
EarFun,Free,5,0,2020-01-19,Love these wireless ear buds!,"I really love having wireless earbuds. They're very secure and don't fall out of my ears. They connect very fast and the sound quality is great. Batter life is great, would definitely recommend."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-19,Very nice budget earbuds,Worth every penny
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-19,Value for money,They sounds good and easy to operate.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-01-19,"On the big side, thus a good fit is needed","Battery life is great, but it’s rather bulky, thus you need to adjust the fit well."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-20,Excellent sound quality,Sound quality was excellent- regardless of price. Excellent value
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-21,"Good sound, good noise cancellation -- great quality for reasonable price!","This is my first set of wireless earbuds, so I don't have any experience to compare with other brands; but I love these earbuds! The Earfun earbuds have great sound and they come with 3 sizes of ear tips so you can get a good seal for noise cancellation. The completely wirefree design is great and the compact size makes it easy to carry with you. The case is capable of recharging the earbuds several times before having to recharge the case. The case can be charged with a USB C cable and also supports wireless charging. The battery life seems good, although I haven't yet used them for a long extended period of time, so I can't say exactly how long they will last on a full charge. I just drop them back into the case whenever I'm not using them, so they always stay charged up. I use them to listen to audiobooks and the sound quality is great. I would think music would also sound good, but I have no experience with that yet. They are more than adequate for my needs and much less expensive than the big name brands! They are very good quality for a very reasonable price!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-24,Great customer service.,The left one speaker went out after only about 10 uses. The company noticed my poor review online and emailed me soon after and shipped me a new replacement within two days. Awesome customer service. Replacement is working just fine.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-25,Great Earbuds for the money!,Comfortable and great sound!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-26,Ok,They work well it’s just the left ear bud won’t connect
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-01-26,"Great sound, terrible comfort","Overall, these are a decent set of true-wireless headphones, especially considering the price. I found the sound quality to be very clear and strong, and when you combine that with the noise cancellation, it was a great experience. Making and receiving calls also worked better than other experiences I’ve had with headphones in the past. However, the one issue I had with them is how uncomfortable to wear they became after just a short period of time. The earbuds themselves were fine, but the bulkiness of the outer shell made my ears sore after 30 minutes. It hurt to take them out, it hurt to keep them in, it hurt to use the controls on the side. It’s enough of an issue that I’m going to spend a little bit more money on more expensive headphones so that I can be comfortable while enjoying music."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-26,Amazing,Amazing! !
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-27,Great Deal on Great Product!,"These are well worth it! I figured I’d buy a middle of the road wireless earbud and stumbled on these. They are great! Very comfortable, easy to use, nice bass."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-28,Great item,"This is such a great product at a very reasonable price. I have been considering other for a while, glad I decided for this one. Only thing is that they feel bulky once in your ear but all others are the same"
EarFun,Free,4,0,2020-01-29,Worked great for 4 months,"Editing my review:
These are great. I did have a problem with them not disconnecting when put back in the case, so I contacted support. They had me do some cleaning and pressing them into the case for a bit which seems to have fixed the issue - could have just been dirt or something in the connection. The good:
-These are great on airplanes and block out all outside noise
-Sound quality is great - hearing and mic
-Battery life
-Fit nice and stay in
The bad (not deal breakers for me):
-No APTX codec - causes audio lag when watching something - if you have VLC on your device there is an audio delay feature that will help
-They block out ALL noise - I kind of like the buds which have some holes to allow for background noise in so I don't have to take them out to talk to someone, just pause whatever you are playing
Overall very happy with these but will look for the other things when I buy my next pair in the future"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-29,Good product for the price,Good product for the price.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-01-30,Inexpensive but definitely not cheap!,"So I saw these as a sponsor for a YouTube video and thought ""sure, these are gonna be one of those things that work but not well cause they're like half the price of normal wireless buds"" kinda thing. Holy Sh** was I wrong! I've only been listening to these for an hour and I already knew I had to leave a review which means a lot cause of all the things I've ordered I may have left a total of 3 reviews no matter how I liked or disliked the product. The sound is PERFECT! I listen to a lot of electronic mixes (mostly Benzi's Girl Trapz and Two Friends Big Booty Mixes) and they make them sound amazing. They were super simple to set up and the guide even made sure to point out that if you're using an Android phone you may have to up the quality on the buds themselves (which it details how to do in the guide) to have the best experience. The sound is incredible and the bass is stellar and yes that's the best word for it lol. I'll update my review in a week or so when I figure out battery life and everything but so far they are amazing and I would 100% recommend as of right now. My only ""complaint"" is minor: to pause, answer the phone, adjust volume, etc. the buttons are actual buttons, not touch sensitive like similar wireless headphones (Airpods). It isn't a real issue but was confusing at first. That's the only thing I would say they could improve for the next gen so far. Overall a great product and worth the little bit of money they cost! P.S. I'm too lazy to take pics but they came packaged just fine and come with the charging case, a (short) USB-C charging cable for the case, came FULLY CHARGED, a user guide, different sized ear things (idk what they're called but the silicone part that you out in your ear), and some other minor pieces of paper."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-01,Outstanding product,I take these with me to the gym very often. They stay in and the sound quality is amazing. I left these in my coat jacket for a few days and battery was still above 85%
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-03,LOVE these,These are really great. I use them at the gym and they are secure and I love not having to mess with the wires. We
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-04,Headphones work great but my left one went out after the first week so I returned.,The headphones actually have great quality. I’m disappointed because my left your phone went out about a week into using the headphones. I rated it based on how satisfied I would’ve been had my earphones worked. The only drawback is that they are a little larger than the top-of-the-line earphones which seem to be lighter and smaller and more slim fit to the ear.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-07,"Great sound, poor microphone, loud internal noises","5 stars in the categories mentioned (battery life, noise cancellation, sound cancellation). However, these do not do well in calls—the microphone is too far away and the other party complains that my voice is muffled. Also, in all the research I did of wireless headphones, no reviews mentioned how loud internal noises would be. For example, I can’t eat something crunchy (pretzels, chips) and properly hear. When I run, I can hear my breath and heartbeat as well as my music. I don’t love this side effect."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-08,Paired immediately with both Pixel phone and iPad,"Both earbuds paired with each other upon removal from case. Very simple pairing process with phone and ipad. My car does not have Bluetooth so have not used a lot yet as they are for use when I'm in the car and receive a phone call. Based on limited use in the house, they are just what I need. Haven't checked noise cancellation while using in my car. Thus only 3 stars until experience with this feature occurs. Will re-evaluate as they get more use."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-08,Good battery life and good price,The battery life is very good on these earbuds. They fit well and the case is handy. I would buy again.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-11,Great Value for the price!,"After reading other reviews, I decided for around $40, to buy and try Earfun ear buds. I have been using Apple AirPods and was very surprised with the sound quality, the comfort and noise cancelling all for around $40. I would definitely recommend these ear buds. Pairing with my iPhone easy."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-12,Great headphones,"I'm a big fan of these particularly for sound quality. It is noticeably a step above other similarly priced ear buds. The battery life and noise cancellation are excellent. If I could change on thing it would be to make them a few decibels louder, but I'm one of those that likes to ruin my hearing with blaring loud music."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-12,Volume imbalance and lower volume,"After about 3 months of usage I noticed the volume in the right head phone dropped off compared to the right side creating an imbalance. Then the left headphone volume dropped off similar to the right headphone. Now the total volume output has greatly decreased where the phone volume needs to be turned up to the max level to have less than ""regular levels"". I did a reset the EarFun Free on multiple occasions with no success. I've contacted EarFun Free for a warranty claim with no response. Updated. I contacted EarFun customer service. Response was prompt and they offered me advice to help correct the issues described above. After the troubleshooting didn’t work EarFun fulfilled the 18 month warranty and sent replacement earbuds."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-13,Great sound and they stay in your ear.,"The best headphones for the money we have ever had. Great sound quality, and noise cancellation. I never can find ones that stay in during a workout, and these are amazing."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-13,Good for the money,They fall out when you sweat
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-14,Worth the price and then some!!!,Beyond surprised of the sound quality!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-15,Great earbuds,Good sound and battery life. They are bulky though and the noise cancellation is just passive.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-15,long lasting and durable!,"it's a great affordable set of earbuds with a long-lasting battery (probably the longest lasting I have)
Also, the buds don't fall out during exercise, which is what I was looking for"
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-02-15,Wrong product for us.,"Unfortunately, the earbuds are to large for my wife. Also the charging station takes a different cord which we do not have. I will be returning the earbuds and biting the bullet to purchase the iPhone earbuds."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-15,Very good product for the price.,"These earbuds are very good! They are an excellent selection for wireless Earbud under $50. They have good overall bass and stay in your ear during workouts and running. The noise isolation works well as you can twist them into your ear canal and frequently need to take them out to hear others talking to you. The bass is very good and crisp Mids. The only thing I would complain of is the volume as with podcast I need to turn up the volume to max to hear properly. It has wireless charging and great magnetic system to hold ear buds in the case even upside down with force with shaking the case. They come with a tremendous battery life. You can listen to one ear but at a time and sync immediately when you take them out of the case. Pros :
-Very long battery life and several chargers with case
-Great bass
-Great overall sound
-inexpensive price point
- Great noise isolation
-Wireless charging capabilities
- USB C
Cons:
-could benefit from increased volume capability especially for podcasts and spoken word audiobooks
- slightly bulky case we can paired to other models"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-18,Great product,What a great quality product and unbeatable price. Highly recommended. Thank you for the quick shipping.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-20,Good product,"Overall it was a good pair of earbud, however I returned it because the touch bottom was really annoying me at the time of calling or listening to music! It was very sensitive to touch and with a very small move or touch either used to end the call or stop the music play!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-22,Great Value,Great Value. Very good but not great sound quality. Better for podcasts and working out than music. Good sound isolation. Excellent battery life. Very easy bluetooth connection. Connects every time to my iphone without fail. Would absolutely buy again.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-23,Great quality for a good price.,My boyfriend LOVES these headphones! The noise cancellation actually works and the sound quality is awesome! Great purchase!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-23,Go with one of the equally good $30 options,I spent a few hours researching which TWB to try and decided on these. I was pretty unimpressed with 1. the volume and 2. the sound quality (particularly the lack of any bass). I returned them for the XClear buds which I'm far happier with for $20 less.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-24,Great wireless earbuds at their price point,"I have been looking to purchase wireless earphones and headphones because of an infant in the house but did not want to spend a lot on Airpods or Galaxy buds. I bought these after reading a very positive review on CNET. These earphones are surprisingly very impressive in connecting to various devices, sound quality and battery life. Has multiple charging features (USB and wireless), is waterproof (although I have not flooded them in water) and sits comfortably in ears. Battery life is amazing as I have only charged it once for less than 30 minutes for a maybe 10 hours of playback time already. The charging case is also very compact and convenient. I have only used them for 6 days now and do not know how they would perform in the long run but I am very satisfied with what I got for 1/3rd the price of other big brand expensive options."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-25,Who needs air pods priced when you can have these?,"Love the price! And they keep a charge for “days” - they’ve never run out of a charge on me! I really appreciate the different sized plastic ear pieces - allows for a more snug & comfortable fit. The only negative is if I talk to someone while I’m wearing them, the movement of my jaw seems to knock them loose & they fall out. Great value!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-25,Highly recommend,Battery last very long before has to be recharged
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-26,"Good sound, but big on the ear","Nice and comfortable qi case, great battery life, good indicator battery lights, and a simple but also stylish design overall for both the case and the earbuds. Earbuds are able to produce good midrange frequencies, and also decent high and low frequencies; however, I just don't feel the warmth of the low frequencies or the richness and fun of the high frequencies. It seems to stop just short of both, or maybe, the sound is just too technical, and therefore, lacking in passion. The size is too big for me, therefore, minus one star."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-26,Actually fits my small ears! Great sound,"Update #2: I use these just about every day for teaching and my zoom meetings. I am still very happy with them. Update: LOVE that these disconnect from your device when put away in case and automatically pair when taken out. So easy. After years of dealing with tangled and twisted earbud cords during my workouts, I am thrilled that those days are over! These EarFun Free earbuds are an all around great purchase. First off, I was impressed as soon as I opened my amazon box. The packaging had a clean, simple presentation. Everything was neatly boxed together and easy to open. The earbuds came charged, which was great. I was really impressed by how easy they are to charge in the case, and how nicely they snap into place so you know they are charging. The quality of the earbuds and case fits this pricepoint very well in my opinion. Next, I could not believe how well these fit my ears. Nothing fits my ears! I have tiny ears and everything always falls out, especially the headphones that always come with my phone. I was not optimistic these would fit, but they fit perfectly. They are snug, yet very comfortable. I have three noisy children, and it was a great opportunity to check out the noise canceling: Yep It's good! Pairing to my phone and watch was a breeze, although I do want to point out I can only pair to one device at a time. I haven't had any issues with them not pairing correctly. I'm a mom and grade school teacher. I don't know anything about specifics with sound and bass. I just want my music to sound good and it does. It sounds great with these headphones. No ""tinny"" sound like you sometimes get with cheapy headphones. The sound quality exceeds my expectation at this price point. It took a little time of looking at my instructions to figure out how to adjust volume, pause music, and activate voice assistant, but everything works well. I love that I can adjust the volume without having to have my phone on me. Just click the left earbud 2x to turn volume down, and right earbud 2x to turn it up. Click 1x to pause/play, and click for 2 seconds to activate voice assistant. 5 seconds powers down the earbuds (or you can put them in the case to power down--another neat feature). Charging: I will update my review if I notice them not lasting the full 6 hours. Personally, that is plenty of time for me. The 1.5 charging time isn't too bad either. Range: The range is better than my expensive smartwatch! Specs say 15 m, and I was able to go upstairs and into a closet before I started to lose sound quality. This isn't super important to me, but an added bonus. I am not a person who will ever spend $$$ on headphones or earbuds, but I do get tired of connectivity issues, broken wires and sound issues with cheaper brands. I think these are a very high quality set of earbuds at a good price point. I would buy again (but hopefully I won't need to for quite some time! )."

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-28,BEST IN ITS PRICE RANGE! - Everything the Average Person Would Want,"I'm going to start with I have recommended these to many of my friends and they all loved it. I enjoyed them so much I bought both colors. The sound on these are balanced. I'll preface with that I'm a bass head. The bass isn't super punchy but its the perfect amount to complement the mids and the highs. The sound-stage is a bit narrow but as a daily driver they are quite nice. They are extremely robust and can take a beating. They are water-resistant to the point if submerged in water they will be fine. As a bonus touch they float! The battery life is pretty good, about 5-6 hours when in constant use but through my tests, one bud will tend to lose charge a bit faster than the other. A minor issue but it is one that should be mentioned. It mic quality is better than"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-02-29,Yes,Good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-02-29,Works well,"Works well, easy pairing (once you read the instructions). The buds are quite big but the plus is they seem to create a nice seal so while these aren’t actually noise-cancelling, they offer a little something. Case seems... not as hefty as some other plastic cases however the snap lid is quite thin and I can see it giving out quickly. Will update with durability and battery life once I’ve used these for a while."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-02-29,Decent sound quality for cost,Decent sound quality for the price. Ear buds are huge compared to others.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-01,So far so good,"So far so good, cuts out here and there(2-3 times a day) not too bad for a pair of 50 dollar buds. Fits nicely."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-02,Great battery life and value!,"I bought these as a replacement for my $125 Galaxy Buds that stopped working after two months. I fell in love with the wireless charging feature of the Galaxy Buds and instantly wanted these! They have a better battery life and have so far been great. The sound quality is maybe slightly less tha the Galaxy Buds, but for the $50 price point, these are a fantastic value!"

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-08,Great pair of headphones,"I've probably bought about 8 different pairs of wireless earbuds now. All but one have been 5-star. It's hard to see the differences, but the more you try the more you know what you're looking for. Now I'm looking for sub $50, great sound, compact and quick to charge. These have all of my requirements, plus they are WHITE! It's my first white pair ever...Well it was, my wife fell in love with them for work and snagged them. These things kick with sound and keep things dancing throughout the day."
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-03-09,911 ...Save your Time and Money,They SUCK ! I tried to work with them as only audio because every time I try to use it hands free people can not hear me or they think I am in a tunnel. The only way to get them to work is to hold one ear bud I’m your hand and talk. That is not hands free in my state. I lost the book . I wish that I had returned them in time. Do not bother pay more and get better!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-09,Stopped charging after 2 months,"UPDATE: After less than 2 months the right ear bud would not charge.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Solid Built Earbuds,"Overall these earbuds are good for daily commutes and office use. Although they are a bit large in size in terms of true wireless earphones, thanks to its curved surface they can fit in my ear securely. Its DAC provides barely noticible floor noise, and the sound quality is crystal clear. I personally prefer to use a smaller sealing caps while in office to provide a better comfort and also allow myself to hear someone else's voice. The charging case sustains quite well and I don't have to charge it often, and the wireless charging helps a lot as I can just drop it on my phone charger for a while and then it is ready to go."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-11,Good quality wireless charging earbuds,It’s a perfect product who’s looking for cheap wireless earbuds but still have a quality. It have a good quality material and connectivity. Battery lasts good but the most important thing is wireless charge option. I have an wireless charger stand and it was perfect fit for it. When i doesnt use the case i left there and it always had a full charge. I really like the music quality also. By the way they had also usb c charging port so you can charge it from there but i definately suggest the wireless option.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-13,Great quality,I love these headphones. The battery life is great and they fit well. The sound is great and they are easy to use.

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-16,High Quality Sound and Extreme Noise Cancellation,"I was looking for cordless ear buds that were more affordable than air pods without sacrificing quality. These are definitely it. They pair easily with your cell phone through bluetooth and deliver incredible sound. I use these for cleaning around the house, doing yard work or trying to block out my husband if we are having a fight . You literally have to remove the earbuds from your ears in order to hear anything. They are designed to stay in your ears easily and also snap into the case to charge or carry. Pretty incredible."
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-03-17,Great earbuds if the mic was louder,"Really loved these earbuds for my tiny ears. They never fell out and blocked out all sound - almost too well! Unfortunately because there is no extended microphone, anytime someone called they could barely hear me. Since I need a pair of earbuds that work for phone calls and music, I had to return these."

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-21,Really nice headphone!,"I bought this one for my boyfriend as the Valentine gift. He loves it so much and use it a lot. He likes to watch movie at night but I use to go to bed early, using this headphone and prevent to disturb my sleep. The White color looks really shape and modern design. It is pretty easy to connect to the TV via the Bluetooth. I tested the distance and it was a bit far away so I could walk in to the kitchen without any problem. It has a water proof feature but I have not tested it yet. The sounds quality is pretty good and warm. It does come with different size of parties which is really nice. I use the original one that comes with it, pretty comfortable. The battery will be the most amazing feature for me. It does last really really long time after 1 charger. Not sure how many hours but I can use like almost 2 weeks without charging it. The last but not least that I picked this one cause of the wireless charging. It is awesome since we have a bed lamp with a wireless charging pad so he can charge without any cables."

EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-23,Excellent Music Sound Quality and Exceptional Battery Life But Call Sound Quality Could be Better,"Overall Verdict: I really like these earbuds because they look stylish, have great music sound quality and exceptional all-day battery life, and the case supports wireless charging. However, I am a bit disappointed that they are not great for calling. So, if your use case is just listening to music or watching videos then they are excellent, however, if you need to make a lot of calls, the experience would be too frustrating. Value for Money: Good: Considering the music sound quality and battery life, they are very reasonably priced. Styling: Good. I have the white ones and they look pretty stylish. Build Quality Look and Feel: Very Good. Both the buds and the case are made from a matt plastic which feels pretty high quality to the touch. Features: Very Good. Bluetooth 5.0 which works perfectly, double-master setup: the earbuds can be used independently if desired, IPX7 Waterproof rating, case that charges wirelesslessly (pretty unique in this price range). Latency: Excellent. No noticeable lag while watching youtube or Netflix on my phone or Macbook Pro. Comfort and Fit: Good. They are pretty comfortable and fit in well. Controls are click type so you would not activate them by mistake easily but they are also not hard to use like some other ones I have tried which press into your ear when you try to use them. Size and Portability: Acceptable. They are definitely on the larger side, but I guess that is justified by the exceptional battery life. I think the case is unnecessarily large and definitely not made for pocketing if you prefer to wear fitted clothes. Call Sound Quality: Needs Imrovement: I can hear the other side very well, however, the other side consistently told me that my voice cuts in an out and is muffled. Music Sound Quality: Excellent: Balanced sounds with strong bass which makes them suitable for any genre of music and listening to podcasts. Battery Life: Exceptional: true all day battery life. I was able to get 8 hours of continuous use without a recharge using them at 60% volume level for a combination of music, podcasts and a few short calls. Connection Stability: Excellent. No disconnections experienced with either Macbook pro or iPhone X over several days of use. Seem to have reasonable range too."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-03-24,"feel like earplugs in your ears, but they do what they're supposed to, and very well","They are white and fit inside your ear. You can make calls, adjust volume, pause/play, and skip between songs all by just pressing on the ear bud while in your ear. These come with the pair of ear buds, a charging cable, a charging case which doubles as a carrying case, and 3 sizes of ear tips that go on the end of the ear bud Small Medium and Large. These will play for up to 6hrs and if the case is charged, will last 30+ hrs. They simulate ear plugs in the sense that they are noise-blocking. They are also waterproof. They come with an instruction manual on how to connect to Bluetooth or reset a connection. WHen you put them in, it's basically like having ear plugs in--it really cancels out all noise. I don't care for that feeling or blockage because I listen to my music softly and want to be able to hear what's going on around me, but that's just my personal preference, nothing wrong with the actual headphones."

EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-30,Great Earbuds!,"Love the quality, color, and ease of use."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-03-31,would happily buy more as gifts!,"i actually like that its not completely noise cancelling. it allows me to hear ambient conversations. these earbuds are not touch! but they are sealed buttons so its kind of best of both worlds. its not supersensitive like touch for clumsy people like me, but you wont have to hear a loud click in your ears when using the button. overall, the sound quality is good. i like the style more than the other budget headphones. i’d recommend for the value"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Good quality with comfortable fit,I really like the design. They provide great quality and fit comfortably. I prefer the white model because they look nice and unique.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,A Great Product for a Great Price,"These earbuds have been perfect! They fit comfortably in my ear (with multiple fittings to choose from), sound great, and very rarely have run low on battery during my work day. The great thing is that if they do run low, I can just pop them back into the carrying case to quickly recharge, even when that's not plugged in. The Bluetooth range is also more than sufficient. My only ""complaint"" is that they are aesthetically bulky. They look almost like having cotton balls in your ears. If looking ""stylish"" is your thing, then pay more to get Apple AirPods. Otherwise, these are quite pragmatic. I did have one technical problem, in which the buds stopped connecting to other devices, but customer service was excellent, and the problem is now resolved!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-01,Clear sound,Clear sound and nice design!
EarFun,Free,3,1,2020-04-01,A bit disappointed,"For the price, I mean I’ve got better for less. They are convenient and battery life is good. But they are bulky and the sound quality isn’t very good. Not a fan."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-02,Very Pleased!,So far so good! Beyond please with this product especially with the price very reasonable! I would definitely recommend this to a friend!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-03,Good quality!,Well packed in box and came with a case to keep them. Lightweight and feels like good quality
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-03,Amazing waterproof earbuds,"This ""Earfun"" is very convenient. It fits to my ear because it provided more sizes of ear tips. It also has perfect size compare to different brand. Now I can use headphone during working and driving which is amazing. In addition, you can adjust volume and connect with any device very fast and easily. Definitely will buy another one for my sister because her car doesn't have Bluetooth mode. I love it so far."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-05,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,I love how these fit! They are great! Excellent sound quality. Pairing with my devices was super easy. They’re my first pair of earbuds and I couldn’t be happier. I love them!
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,Best Bluetooth ea,These are super comfortable and sound really good I was able to use them all day off a single charge. I move around alot for my job and the only time they came out of my ears is when i pulled them out! They're very secure with the included wings.Bluetooth pairing was very quick and simple . I like these better then apple earbuds.If anybody is in the market for good Bluetooth earbuds I would say these are the best value for your bucks.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-06,The best is the Qi Wireless Charging feature. It can also use USB C,"Dont have to worry about those wires any more as this can charge wirelessly on a Qi pad. It also has a USB C port which is quite useful since most of the devices now a days use USB c type. Color is good. Very nice finish to the body and material is quite impressive. The Ergonomic design of the ear buds helps them stay in the ears without much falling off. They are sweatproof and noise cancelling. Both featrues function smoothly. Giving a premium design, they seem to be engineered to output ear blasting sound. Great sound quality. Crisp voice and audio. Astonishing deep bass. The charging case is quite smaller and fits in the palm. The case can charge well on the Qi pad or using USB C cable. The charge lasts longer as well and run time of ear buds is good as well. Overall, one of the best ear buds with unique features like USB C and Qi charging."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,Best in the business,this is the only ear buds which has : wireless charging and usb-c and 500mah battery . i havent seen anything else have all the features i wished for . taking phone calls is not its forte but everything simply fantastic.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-07,My BT earbud search is finally over! Earfun Buds are 5 star and more!,"Finally my search for great sounding BT earbuds are over, I bought the white set and will definitely add the black pair to my families collection of earbuds. These aren't little in ear buds but I have ears that fit my 5'3, less than 120 lb frame and they work. I HAVE SO MANY BT HEADSETS mostly because I use them to talk hands free and I also used to sell cellular phones and these type of products that could be used with cellular phones so I am somewhat of an expert... These pair easier than most, they charge in the box like the infamous airpods, nowadays they almost all do, it just is a matter of whether they have a hook that goes over the ear or if they just sit inside your ears and honestly the ones that go over my ear give me more problems because of my hair I think. I used to have my hair down to the middle of my back now it's just about 3-4 inches beyond my shoulders so I find it still interferes just slightly with the over the ear part. These EarFun Buds have the best sound I have heard since buying a over $200.00 pair that proved to have a short life and have a very poor warranty. Electronics can be a crap shoot and factor in the fact they go in your ear I highly suggest a lower price points unless your doing an over the ear by Beats or something like that. But now I can honestly say I will look no further as I can't be wearing a puffy pair of DJ BT or wired headphones, these have great music sound and for me, the fact that I can have a conversation on them without dropping the call or having the person on the other end telling me to take my earbuds out because they can't hear me has made me a firm believer that you can find a good pair of BT earbuds made for both music and Cellular conversations! I love how easily they pair each time I go to use them, the noise cancelation takes a little getting used to while not in use because if your not talking or listening to music it feels q little like your under water, but that's the point, to seal out unwanted interference and the battery life on these little guys (bigger than some in the ear) is 5 star and then some. I hope this helps many people who are tired of buying earbuds over and over again because of poor sound quality, poor Cellular BT connections or performance and if it helped you please hit helpful because I have been relying on Reviews since I started shopping online so many many years ago but never really cared to review anything unless it was a case where I was asked over and over in an email baby the seller. Now I have taken it on just to help others because now is a time of online shopping more than ever with Social distancing and I want to thank everyone that helps get us our products fast and effectively. Hit helpful pleas eif this review helped you make any kind of decisions at all. Stay safe and feel confident this product definitely delivers what it promises and then some! I will attach photos when I come back to update after more use, I decided I would do an update if I review a product before a month goes by!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-08,Great AirPods Alternative,I wanted a good airpod replacement they u could use when I’m working outside. These were way better than I thought they would be. Quick pairing. Fast charging. WIRELESS CHARGING (love that). Good sound. Better fit than the AirPods could ever hope to give. I love them and am going to buy my daughter a pair…she keeps trying to take mine.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-11,Notice cancellation,"I bought these for my wife because she had a pervious pair (different brand) that stopped working. Decided to try these ones out and the noise cancellation is way better than her old ones! They are comfortable, but don't have a rubber price surrounding it so not quite as comfortable as maybe other ones. But the sound quality and noise cancellation is great so it makes up for that."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-12,Favorite,My favorite earbuds. Charges pretty fast and the charge lasts a long time. Clear sound quality. Great noise cancellation this makes it where i can be quarantined in silence well except.for my music. This holds charge longer then most earbuds
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-13,"Good battery life, clear sound",Good price for the product. They fit differently than the other earphones but I love them. Sounds clear and great for working with your hands. Good battery life
EarFun,Free,2,1,2020-04-14,"Won’t stay in, while constantly working/moving.",People can’t hear you very well.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-14,The voice of the devil,"Great quality, great mediant!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-15,The music was clear,"Wearing long also does not hurt, standby time is very long, can use for a long time, I am a day to night, this standby time can satisfy me.The call was also loud.After listening to the music, I feel the sound quality is ok, the appearance is exquisite, small, the voice is big, the clarity is high, the time is long, all aspects are good."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-17,"Great product, just don't like how it sticks out my ear a bit","So many things I love about this product. I love the case they live in: I love that it charges them while in the case. I love that the buds turn on as soon as I take them out of case. That wifi connects immediately (except it's annoying when I want wifi on a different product!). I like that I can just use one bud at a time and leave the other to charge (no idea if this is an issue with other products, but would be annoying to me if I couldn't use one while the other charges). This is great for podcasts when you don't need full sound/both buds. The range is very good. I am not an audiofile but the sound is good to me. Noise cancellation is good too, I think. I think the price is good, though I didn't research a lot before I bought them. I don't feel like I got a ""steal"" or like I paid a lot, so I think the price is possibly right, or not far off it. My only issue is that the profile is large - they sit well in my ear and rarely feel like they will pop out of my ear, but they look too big. I bought the white and it looks like I have marshmallows stuck in my ear! Next time I would buy the black."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-18,Good value,"The only potential issue I have found with these is the overall size. They're snug in my ear, and are too large for my wife (who is petite, but I don't know her ear hole measurement!). Otherwise, the sound is good and it has nice features for an inexpensive ear bud."
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-19,Well worth it!,"Been using them for an hour now. Amazing quality, just wish the volume was higher. I normally listen to media with very low volume. Easy connect, and extremely comfortable. Get them!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-19,Very cute little headphones,"The white angel earphone is the same as the product introduction. Its Bluetooth connection is very stable and the sound quality is particularly good. It is suitable for long-term wear, without discomfort after pulling out the ear. , The sound quality during the call is excellent, the overall headset looks very high-end, it is very convenient to carry around, it is worth recommending purchase"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-20,Value for money earbuds,"Quality is superb for the price you pay. I like the wireless charging feature since I already have a charging stand for my phone which has a slot for this case. The white color for sure looks like apple airpods. Sound didn't dissappoint, infact it was surprisingly good for this price. I would have preferred a touch button control instead of the 'press' button currently, but it's not a deal breaker for me."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-21,Design is perfect,Simple amazing😍 my husband love to much this product.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-21,excellent review,Great product!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-22,Good value,People say I sound very clear. Music sounds good. Good value in my opinion.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-22,Very good product,"Compact in appearance, beautiful in shape and fashionable in color, compact in charge box, easy to carry, long standby time"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Excellent performance at an excellent price.,"There earbuds surprised me, I just can’t believe how AMAZING the sound quality is for this low price. Make sure you use the right tips, because I almost wanted to return the earbuds when I first tried them on with the pre-installed tips. Once I figured out how to get a good fit, it’s a pure pleasure to run with them."
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-23,Wireless Earbuds,"The battery life is pretty sufficient (about 6 hours). They charge pretty fast with the Type C cable included. They are also waterproof, which is great. You can control the volume on the earbud itself. The product also includes an 18-month warranty!"
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,Great price,Really good earbuds at a great price. Stays in ears.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-25,So far so good,So far so good! With everyone being home and doing school work from home we needed another pair of quality buds to help the kids stay on task. These appear to have a good battery quality and great sound control. My 10 year old can still focus while others are creating some noise a room away.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-25,Battery life...booooooooo!!!,They are getting the low stars bcuz the battery life in them is no good. May get three hours and that's that.
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-26,Superb earbuds!,Packaging is really good . It looks similar to Jabra and the earbuds are really sleek and have a slim design. Quality is really good
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-26,Good buy,I am so glad I researched and found these earbuds. Easy to connect and sound great. They fit well and do not hurt my ears.
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-27,Easy to pair with any phone,Just got the earbuds today! Looks really good after open the box. The sound is really clear! Design looks really cool! I strongly suggest who need the earbuds to get one like this!
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-27,on overall is good Bluetooth but for my ear they are to big,I dislike that is to big for my ear
EarFun,Free,1,1,2020-04-28,Poor sound quality,Sound quality was bad and left ear had buzzing and right had way to much bass requested replacement to see if it was a bad pair or not will update if new ones work better
EarFun,Free,5,1,2020-04-28,Highly recommend!,"I have used these a handful of times so far and LOVE them!! The case was fully charged when I received them almost a week ago and is still at full charge. The Bluetooth pairing was seamless. As soon as I insert one it says it is powered on and connects instantly. They fit well and are comfortable for extended wear ( I watch Hulu, Netflix on my phone so I wear them for a good 2-3+ hrs at a time). The sound is fantastic! I have not used them for music but can't imagine it being less than as well. I would highly recommend these! !"
EarFun,Free,4,1,2020-04-29,"Exquisite, firm and durable","I've been using it for a week, so if you're looking for quality headphones that can both listen to music and make phone calls, this is a great option! I've tried a lot of bluetooth headsets, but this is my first fully wireless set. Color: white is my favorite color, so I chose it. Sound: I've been listening to rock music and some heavy hip-hop music with good clarity. The midpoint was well rebuilt. Microphone: people say I sound clear, but they admit I sound like I'm far away from the phone. Overall, I think these methods work well in some cases. If you are in sales or need to use the mobile phone for a long time, I will stick to the bluetooth headset. Sports/waterproofing: I haven't (extensively) tested this, but the buds seem to be in good shape while running. Based on reading other reviews, the headphones seem to be quite durable. Charging/power supply: I seem to get the 5-6 hour running time advertised, and the charger is fast. They have now been used in several runs over 20 miles. I didn't expect these to replace my usual running headphones. They were so light, they wouldn't move at all. The pairing process is simple, so you can navigate the controls. The compact charging case is very good, and it has an indicator light to let you know how full it is."
