V-Moda,M-200,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-04,Complete package,"This is a very complete package. I was floored by how musical and accurate the reproduction across genres and styles is. With beautiful sharp bass detail and elaborate highs that allow for a very realistic human voice representation. I felt a pretty wide stage and openness for a closed back set. They are relatively easy to drive and supply quick and impressive consistency at low and high volume. The physical design construction and presentation in the case are pretty inspiring. I loved the thin metal hanger forks and the clicky hinge – that click is a little satisfying thing every time you take them out of the case. The bolts in the backs and in the band add to the aesthetic. The carrying case is well made and surprisingly compact. No complaints in the comfort department – no ear pain, no headache, bald friendly headband, light! The passive isolation is fine but not noteworthy and the sound leakage is very minimal. The magnetic cushions are easy to remove and replace – although I don’t have any replacements at this point. You get two easily distinguishable cables in the box – a balanced one with a mic and controls (orange) and the single balanced (black). I recorded some voice with the orange cable mic and it is easily good enough for phone calls (did not try in a noisy environment). When taking them off I had a tendency to pull the cables on the back sides by mistake – teach your hand to avoid that. The cables survived. I found cable port on the headset to be surrounded by what seems to be cheaper plastic, this is the plastic around the cup “Shields” – it doesn’t feel as high end and designed as the rest of the materials. Unfortunately this is my first V-MODA so can’t compare to other offerings from the same brand. Hope this helps you with a purchase decision.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YXBPGG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
V-Moda,M-200,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-08,"V-Moda wired headphones with a flat EQ, an even sturdier build, and added comfort","I am a fan of V-Moda’s headphones. In addition to the M-200 that I am reviewing now, I have a V-Moda Crossfade 2 Codex Edition, which are one of my “fun-sounding” headphones that are especially great for dance, EDM, and pop music. The M-200 interested me because they have a totally different sound signature, tuned for sound engineers and audiophiles who prefer a flat frequency response, which is more in line with the other headphones I use frequently (the Hifiman Sundara and the Oppo PM-3). Overall, the M-200 sounds great, is comfortable, and is built like a tank. Because I love headphones, I go into a lot of depths in these areas in my review. My review also contains numerous comparisons to the V-Moda Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex Edition, which may be a better headphone for you if you want wireless connectivity or a more V-shaped sound signature. #### Design
V-Moda is a design-focused headphone maker—just look at the hexagonal earcups and the customizable shields they sell for them. While their products are are indubitably fashion-forward, they actually sound really good, too. V-Moda (as of 2016) is owned by Roland, a leading manufacturer of music instruments and equipment. (I know Roland from its keyboards, which are widely used professionally.) I trust that V-Moda is being supervised by, and collaborating with, people who understand music and sophisticated audio processing—people who have music on their minds, rather than just looks. The M-200 looks very much like the V-Moda Crossfade series, but is designed to be more durable and more comfortable, because their intended audience may be wearing them all day long. #### Materials and build quality
V-Moda headphones are widely respected for their relative indestructibility. All their headphones are made of metal and synthetic leather, with a little bit of synthetic fabric inside the earcups. The M-200 is no different. The M-200 is very solidly built, and appear likely to last for years and years. (This is not a given for headphones in this price range. I have thrown away broken headphones that cost about the same amount of money as the M-200 because part of their plastic headbands broke.) There is no plastic in sight. Instead, everything is either metal or PU leather. The parts that are most likely to get damaged, the cable and the earpads, are easy to remove and to replace. The earpads are attached via magnets, which offer a secure hold and make replacing the earpads really, really easy. The overall build quality of the M-200 is higher than that of the Crossfade series. Compared to the Crossfade 2, the M-200 has thicker wires and more rigid, reinforced connections from the headband to the earcups. The only thing I could see ever being a problem with these headphones, in terms of durability, is the PU leather breaking down after a number of years. I say this because of my experience with the Bose QuietComfort 25; its synthetic leather started to flake (basically, to disintegrate) after seven or eight years. If that happens to the M-200, you can easily buy and swap out the earpads, but the wrapping around the band is not so easy to replace. If something like that happens to you long after the warranty expires, or if you destroy the M-200 through some kind of gross negligence, or you just want to upgrade, the “V-Moda Immortal Life Program” has your back. You can send your V-Moda headphones back, even if you “run over it with a tank” (their words), for a coupon code towards a comparable product from their website. I actually tested this when I upgraded from the Crossfade 2 to the Crossfade 2 Codex Edition. The process was easy, fast, and painless. #### Comfort
Comfort deserves special attention because these are marketed as studio headphones. If you are working in a studio and want to use these, you will be wearing them for hours on end. I think they are comfortable enough to for that. While they share the same design language as all the other V-Moda headphones, they have slight differences that make them the most comfortable V-Moda variant. Overall, these headphones are comfortable. I have worn them all day at work, with some breaks for lunch and stuff, without feeling any pain or fatigue. They are not too heavy. Their weight is well balanced. They don’t exert too much squeezing pressure on my head. The M-200 headband is slightly wider than that of the V-Moda Crossfade 2. It distributes the headphones’ weight over a larger surface area at the top of the head, which makes it more comfortable. Clamping force is moderate on the M-200, about in line with that on the Crossfade 2. I wear glasses, have a large head (7 3/4 hat size), and am particularly prone to irritation from headphone pressure, and have not had any issues with the tightness of the squeeze on my head. Some clamping force is good, because it helps with passive isolation. The M-200’s ear cushions are made of memory foam covered by synthetic leather. They are slightly larger than the ones that come with the Crossfade 2, which mean that they cover my ears completely, rather than resting on the outside edge of them. That means that the M-200 is either much more comfortable, or somewhat more comfortable, than the Crossfade 2 for me. (The degree of increased comfort is somewhat dependent on my mood.) They get a little warm, but never too hot. I am using them inside my house in the winter, so I’m not in a hot room while testing them. The earcups swivel only one one axis (up/down), rather than two (left/right and up/down). In theory, this limits comfort a little compared to many other headphones. In practice, the headphone flexes a little bit, and I have not noticed discomfort arising because they don’t pivot on two axes. #### How easy are they to drive? These headphones have a resistance of 30 ohms. That means that they are very easy to drive. In fact, my iPhone and iPad drive them just fine. If you want to use a DAC and headphone amp, you definitely can. I tested them mostly with my Schitt Magni 3 Heresy/Modi stack, and they sounded great. I also tested them with my 2017 iPad Pro’s headphone jack, and that sounded great, too. You don't need an amp; it didn't bring anything extra out of them. I just like using my DAC/amp stack to ensure consistent and clean input to all my headphones. #### Sound
The M-200 may look a lot like the Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex Edition I also have, but they sound completely different. I would politely direct you to the V-Moda Crossfade series if you like everything else about these headphones but aren’t sure about the sound signature I am describing. The M-200 is more tuned toward professional sound engineers and toward audiophiles than they are toward general consumer preferences. By this I mean that their EQ curve is, essentially, flat (this is from a subjective standpoint; I don’t have the knowledge or equipment to objectively measure their frequency response curve). Most consumer headphones have a V-shaped frequency response curve, which means they boost bass and treble and put less emphasis on midrange. The Crossfade series has a more V-shared EQ, which sounds exciting, but dulls the midrange. The M-200, in comparison, makes the midrange stand out. It may not be what you are used to. You can hear _everything_ in the frequencies where most of the music is. Detail and separation are superb. You can hear elements of recordings that you either overlooked or couldn't hear before. This reveals flaws in the recording, which is exactly what you want if you are a music production professional, but may not be what you want as a casual listener. Well—produced music sounds great; poorly produced music sounds lousy. You will hear how the track was recorded and produced. If bass is prominent in the mix, it will hit you and sound great. If bass is recessed in the mix, it will sound relatively quiet (it’s there, but it does not overpower the mids and the highs). This is the point of studio headphones. It is part of the fun with audiophile headphones. It may not align with your listening preferences, however. If you are a basshead, these are not the headphones for you. Basslines sound fantastic on the M-200, especially when they are prominent in the mix (“Another One Bites the Dust,” “Brown Eyed Girl”), but, if they are not as prominent in the mix (the excellent bassline in Led Zeppelin’s “Ramble On” is crisply and politely delivered, but doesn’t sound as prominent I remember; my memory of the song is shaped by the V-shaped EQ on my old stereo). I listened to hundreds of songs over the course of a week. Some albums I listened to that sounded great were the following:
- “Cut & Stitch” by Petrol Girls (punk)
- “Diatom Ribbons” by Kris Davis (jazz)
- “Two Hands” by Big Thief (indie rock)
- “Sea Change” by Beck (acoustic rock)
Pop and dance music sound great to me through these headphones, but my listening preferences are more in tune with fast, tight bass with some slam, rather than heavy, loud, mushy bass. A few songs do not sound so good to me through these headphones. One example is “Ashes of American Flags” by Wilco, which has a consistent treble noise all through it that is too much for me to bear using these headphones. Some of that is due to my own hearing issues. Some of that is probably due to their mixing and mastering. Some of it may be due to the relative brightness of these headphones. I’m not entirely sure. Overall, though, I think these headphones sound excellent, and give me what I want as an audiophile music listener. #### Passive isolation vs active noise cancellation (ANC)
V-Moda’s marketing promises great passive isolation from these headphones. It is true that they cover your ears and make outside noise harder to hear, but these do not block out sound like the ear protection ear muffs, and passive isolation is not really a substitute for ANC for very loud environments like airplane cabins. I would not recommend these for frequent plane rides or bus rides necessarily; they are geared toward a different segment of the headphone market. #### Active noise canceling
These are not noise canceling headphones. I don’t think you should want that in this type of headphone, though. Active noise cancellation radically alters the sound. These headphones are about reproducing the sound as it was recorded, as accurately as possible. #### Wireless connectivity
These are wired headphones—full stop. Get the Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex Edition if you want Bluetooth. #### Choosing between the M-200 and the Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex Edition
The M-200 is probably the best headphone V-Moda makes. It sounds so different than the Crossfade 2, though, that I think that headphone may appeal to some people more than this one. The Crossfades 2 series are excellent consumer-focused headphones. The M-200 are more like tools for studio engineers and audiophiles to pick through recordings to find what’s wrong with them and to enjoy what is great about them. The Crossfade 2 has a different sound signature that is V-shaped (not too bass-heavy, but far more than the M-200), punchy, and a lot of fun. The M-200 has a flat EQ and can highlight details, including flaws, in a recording. That type of sound may either be exciting to you (if you are an audiophile), a necessary feature for you (if you are a recording engineer), or annoying to you (if you insist on loud, booming bass, or want a more laid back sound signature). Lastly, if you want wireless connectivity, the M-200 won’t do for you. You should go with the Crossfade 2 Codex Edition.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YXBPGG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I have many pairs of in-ear earphones. I've had several pairs of over-the-ear heaphones. These are like none I have experienced before. When I put them on, I feel like I've been given a hearing upgrade. I don't get the chance to sit and really listen to music much anymore on my several thousand dollar stereo system. I've gotten used to listening to crappy little headphones. I use my over-the-ear headphones when I'm meditating.

V-Moda,M-200,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2020-01-14,"Studio quality sound, but poor comfort","I really hope v-moda comes out with the XL or over-the-ear cushions for this headset. Comfort is my only complaint with these and the only reason I went 4 stars instead of 5. They are not large enough to be over-the-ear for an adult and after a few hours they become a bit uncomfortable and I have to keep adjusting them. To test the audio quality, I first hooked the unbalanced 1/8"" cord into a Playstation 4 controller. I will say I was hearing highs and lows from the game sound effects and music that I've never heard before; ultra-high clarity. The low end and bass was noticeably better. When I switched it over to my PC with a decent, integrated, Realtek audio chip, the sound was ok. It wasn't any better than a set of Alienware or high-end gaming headphones. I also went into the audio device settings and set it up to 24-bit, 192,000 Hz (studio quality) format. Then I tried my go-to YouTube test of, ""The Who - Who Are You (Promo Video)"" cranked up to a decent listening level. Once again, it was good quality sound, but not even as good as the output from the Playstation 4. That could just be mediocre on-board audio and I'm sure these headphones excel in a studio environment. Checking the main drivers on these, they are decent size; 50mm as advertised. The ear cushions pop off so you can replace them or swap them out with a different type. I checked the v-moda website, but as today they currently do not offer the XL (more cushioned) or over-the-ear cushions for the M-200. I certainly hope they do in the future because that would solve the comfort issue. They ship with a really nice, hardshell / clamshell style carry case. It also includes a balanced, male-to-male 1/8"" cord and 1/8"" to 1/4"" plug adapter. You could certainly adapt these to a balanced 3-XLR connection for studio use. The frame of the headphones is really solid; all metal design that collapses down and folds in to fit the case. No faults there. They ship with a really nice, hardshell / clamshell style carry case.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YXBPGG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
V-Moda,M-200,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-19,Audiophile treat,"I take my music listening very serious. I do not work in the music industry, but know these headphones, the reputation, and awards. This for me, is the pinnacle of audio equipment. You can immediately see, and feel the quality to include the packaging. The headphones come packaged, and folded compactly in a very nice hard case. Unfolding the headphones reveals a high tech, and superbly tuned piece of audio art. They are beautifully designed, and are not near as heavy as I expected them to be. The ear cups are metal construction, and are very solidly built. They are made not only to sound great, but also feel great. They are very comfortable. The ear pads are so soft, and they literally seal the sound in, and keep outside interference out. The earpads are magnetically attached, making them easy to replace. The headband is also very softly padded for comfort. The headband is fully adjustable for optimized fit. The ear cups are hinged to provide the best positioning to your head and ears. Now for the best. The sound. These headphones reproduce such a clean, rich and full sound. Stereo separation is so spacious and wide. I do not have a balanced audio system, so I use the standard included 3.5 mm cable with the included 1/4 in jack adapter. You can connect the cable in either ear cup. If you do have a balanced audio system, there is a balanced audio cable also included. The feel and sound reproduction is something that you can immerse yourself into. These headphones seal you off from the world, and transport you into a sound experience. I have had many headphones over the years, but none of them closely matches these. The sound is pure and clean, no interference, no hum, and when there is nothing playing, there is dead silence. Lossless digital music opens up and even vinyl sounds great. If you take your music serious, these are a great addition to any audiophile collection. Their performance is something to experience, and I feel that they are great value. They get and deserve every one of the 5 stars I give them.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YXBPGG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
V-Moda,M-200,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-27,EXCELLENT Headphones,"It's hard to benchmark something in this price category because it's literally the most expensive piece of audio hardware I own. Is it worth the price? Maybe. But if you just care about good sound and a great listening experience it's not my #1 recommendation. It is however, the best MONITOR headphones I have heard so far, and whether or not that's what you want is subjective. For starters I'll just come out and say that if you want a truly outstanding listening experience for music, save some money and get yourself the over-ear ""Creative Sound BlasterX H5 Professional Analog Gaming Headset"". Just rip out the microphone and listen to your music. It won't be flat but it will be sublime as long as your audio source has enough power to push it. Now if you want something smaller that's monitor...well these definitely fit the bill...if you got the bills to spend. The comfort is insane. Truly the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn in this form factor (not huge over-ear cans, not earbuds, just small foldable on-ear headphones). After extended use, not discomfort. Excellent. The audio cable (there are two included, for if you have the equipment supporting the other standard), plugs in easy enough, but I don't like that folding the headphones with the cable plugged in will likely warp the cable over time due to pressure from the headphones against it (design flaw). Regardless, they fold up real nice. There's a nice hard case included, but putting the headphones in it is a bit of pain, and if you disconnect the headphones to wrap them up which seems to be the intention, this is more a ritual than I like for putting on a pair of headphones. I'm looking for a cloth bag to keep them in as I don't want to get them dirty but folding up and zipping up in a hard case is just too inconvenient. As far as sound goes after about 30 minutes they break in nicely and sound is very smooth and free of distortion except in one test (possibly due to sound source). Vocals are perfect. Stereo stage is good but not overly spacious. Bass is present and tight but not boosted. Pop music and orchestral sound excellent generally. HOWEVER! While sound quality is excellent generally, acoustic characteristics are not optimized for pleasurable listening. When you listen to Tron Legacy soundtrack the French Horn is not gonna make your spirit soar and the bass is not gonna rattle your bones. The resonance on extremely demanding tracks won't submerse and surround you as with headphones optimized for listening. And using my benchmark track ""No Time for Caution"" from Interstellar, the fast, frantic Pipe Organ Sounded muddy at full volume. I'm hoping this was just a limitation of my audio source and hope to use a headphone amp soon to see if I can get better performance, but if you are not using a headphone amp it's worth noting. If you want your audio spectrum flat and your notes clear and sharp this set of headphones is excellent. They are very balanced, and very clear, with zero distortion except in my one test. If you want headphones for listening to music on the cheap... get the Creative Sound BlasterX H5 Professional Analog Gaming Headset. If you want small form-factor super-comfortable set of monitors...get these if you can afford them. Be aware. Some headphones like Sennheiser and Klipsch tend to be on the cold side. Others may be warm or ""bright"" (like Edifier). These are right in the middle in my testing so be aware of your preference before ordering.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YXBPGG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
V-Moda,M-200,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-02-10,In a compact hardshell carrying case,"This is a set of over-the-ear headphones for music. The headphones have a metal headband encased in faux leather and padded on the contact side. The muffs are on mounted on steel bands that pull out of the headband with ratcheting action. The muffs are padded with faux leather in the contact areas. There is a small volume control knob on the bottom of the right earpiece. The headphones ship with 2 audio cables, one with an inline microphone and controls. Also, a small hardshell zippered case. These headphones do not have active noise cancelling, nor can they be used wirelessly. The V-moda logo appears printed across the top of the headband and on the hinge of the carrying case. I love the sound that these headphones produce when I am listening to music. The sound is rich throughout the range, from bass to treble. The headphones work well for listening to classical music on a turntable or pop music on an iPod. They are comfortable and light weight. I don’t know how long the faux leather will last on the earpads. On my premium Sony’s, the faux leather lasted about 10 years, so I expect it would be the same for these. These headphones give a decent amount of noise isolation, but not nearly as much as with my Seinhauser GSP 600s. I love the way these headphones fit into such a tiny carrying case. That would make them great for travel, but without active noise cancelling or superior passive noise isolation, they’re probably not the best choice for air travel. Super for simply listening to music in a quiet location, though.

I started out with the built in motherboard sound card and wasn't very impressed with the sound quality until I remembered I had an old SB X-Fi Titanium I bought in 2010. After hooking everything up, the sound quality is astounding. Before the sound card change, it was difficult to notice the difference between my cheap gaming headset and these; now there's no question. I can finally justify downloading 100MB+ songs. I've got a bunch of old .dts files and some other 5.1 music that sound incredible on these. Also just regular hd streaming video and music sounds much better. The detachable cord is really great, being able to switch which side the cable is plugged in is very convenient. I'm pretty rough on my equipment and these seem like they will stand the test of time. The ear cushions could be a bit bigger, after a few hours my ear lobes start to hurt a bit, but that may be a sound quality verse comfort level thing. edit: I'v since had a slanted third party review these connected to a mac book pro headset port vs the PC expensive sound card, and the PC won over a 20+ year MAC fanboy.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YXBPGG7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

All I can judge them on is in my limited capacity as a music fan and as a sometimes videographer. To me the sound quality is quite good. I am not a fan of the too deep bass and I don't hear too much bass, so I'm happy. I like to listen too older music from the 20s and 30s and depending on the material some of it sounds excellent even with the occasional click and static. Video games sound great on them as well. Playing movie dialog of my own recording and exterior and interior sound has made it easier to notice negative background noises that I might not have picked up on as quickly.
