Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-10-30,Airpods Pro deliver😎,"This airpods pro do exactly what apple said they will do they have noise cancelling, transperancy and water resistant they also come with different size buds to fit your ear it will also tell you if your putting them correctly i like them very much i am please i know to many people $273.11 thats including tax is alot of money but all the components and new design apple put in it makes it worth it.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-10-30,List of Features/Changes compared to Airpods (v2),"Like iphone 11 Pro, Macbook Pro, Airpad Pro; the ""Pro"" denotes a higher end product. Compared to the Airpods (version 2) highest end model (with wireless charging case*); the Airpods Pro is $50 more MSRP. Compared to the non wireless case version it's $90 more
*Airpods Pro does have wireless charging case by default. Only one version. Let's go through the differences
1. Physical Appearance:
Shorter Stem, but larger bud or head
There's a large black airflow grill
A mic inside and outside the Airpods
Case is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable
2. In-ear, instead of on-ear
If your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place. Those with normal or larger cavum it'll fit well. Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canal
These ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open one
Seeing that it's an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling on
Seeing that it's in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall out
There's a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There's several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it'll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for you
If you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out
3. Squeeze instead of tap
Instead of tapping on the earbuds, you are pinching or squeezing the stem. 1x to play, pause, and answer calls
2x to skip forward tracks
3x to skip back tracks
Press and hold to switch between active noise cancel and transparency mode
Still able to say ""Hey Siri"" to do voice commands/adjust volume anytime
No physical volume controls on buds
4. Battery life
Battery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimates
Pro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode. You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you're not going to unless you're really desperate for battery
Pro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hours
Case both old 24 hours battery life
Pro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk
5. Water/sweat resistant
Now you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on. As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it's in-ear
May survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though
6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency mode
Airpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency mode
Active nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I'd say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren't focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what's going on, but in general it does it's job. Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playing
Transparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you're able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets. Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk
7. Sound Quality
Better than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It's not $250 audiophile quality sound. Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to those
You can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice
--Conclusion:
Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation. There are other headphones that do it better sound in this price range, but may not be as convenient with pairing to Apple devices.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

To be honest the airpods pro dont sound THAT much better than either of the two. All three products have such a similar sound signature that it just comes down to what you will be using them for. None of them stand out as “being better”. If you want improvement from airpods get Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, etc.
Get the airpods 2 if you dont care about noise cancelling, for example you will be using them in the office at work or at a library. Get the airpods pro if you will be using them in noisy environments such as the bus, walking, coffee shops, airplanes , etc because the noise cancelling is really good for earbuds. Get the powerbeats pro if you want workout earbuds. *Update*
On a last note, I ended up having to return the airpods pro due to a pressure feeling they would create on my head. Wore them for 2 weeks straight about 5 hours at a time, and everytime I would feel as if something was off, I would get a headache, and just plain felt sick. Apple supposedly put vents to relieve pressure but they’re useless as I never had this problem with my Sony xm3 which have much stronger ANC.

The all-new, lightweight, in-ear design boasts a customizable fit while providing complete sonic performance. Use Active Noise Cancellation to keep you focused on enjoying your content, or switch to Transparency Mode to stay aware of what's going on in the environment around you. To ensure a rewarding listening experience, the AirPods Pro utilize Adaptive EQ to automatically sculpt the tonal output to suit your unique ear shape. Their custom high-excursion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers deliver clear, detailed sound with bass down to 20 Hz, all while keeping distortion low and upholding extended battery life. The flexible silicone eartips come in three sizes and advanced algorithms allow the AirPods Pro to analyze the fit and let you know if the current eartip size is giving the ideal seal. Following a single-tap setup, these AirPods automatically turn on and maintain their connection to your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac computer; forget having to manually engage or disengage power. Enjoy music, answer calls, or communicate with Siri on your mobile device without having to pull out your iPhone. These AirPods automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency. Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge—or 4.5 hours of listening time in Active Noise Cancellation mode, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a wireless charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time. Just 5 minutes in the case gives you approximately one hour of listening time. Charge the case via a Lightning connector or take advantage of its compatibility with Qi mats (available separately) for true wireless charging.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Maybe I'm the outlier but they still don't feel secure in my ears and they just don't sound that good. The noise cancellation and transparency mode are great and I hope to see those features in all future versions.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-05,Pretty much perfect,"When I thought the old Airpods were already very good, Apple came out with something that's even significantly better. Pros:
- Fits: very well. The old Airpods fit my ear well, these new ones fit even better. My ears do not get hurt after hours of wearing. And these do not even come close to falling out when I run. - Noise cancellation and transparency mode: both work amazingly. - Waterproof. However these are only splash proof. Meaning rain/spills/sweat are ok, but no swimming yet. - Sound quality: very decent. But probably not too insane to satisfy audiophiles. - Build quality: superior, as expected from Apple. Especially when consider small details like the silicon eartips. They snap extremely well into the Airpods and are very, very hard to remove. - Sync: very well with iPhone and Mac, as expected from Apple. Have not tested with Android, Windows. - Size: very conveniently small. You can easily wear them lying down in bed. Traveling case is also pretty small (just a tad bigger than old Airpods' case)
- Design: this is very subjective. But I think the Airpods are the best looking earbuds in the market right now. Big reason why I choose them over other headphones. Cons:
- Battery life: they're ok, I wish they last longer. Quote from Apple, battery lasts up to 4 hours 30 minutes of music time. In reality it lasts a bit more than 4 hours. But sometimes I wear them continuously way longer than that.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-05,My favorite new Apple Product. Great bang for your buck!,"If you can believe it, there was a time in our history when people were skeptical of Apple’s AirPods, myself included. We poked fun at the wireless buds protruding from early adopters’ skulls, their ears housing white plastic hoping to be reunited with the rest of their 3.5mm headphone cable. Shortly after we saw knockoff after knockoff and countless attempts by other companies to match the quality Apple provided. Some came close, but nothing matched the superior engineering and design that Apple puts into their products. The airpods pro offer wireless Qi charging so I think it’s fair to compare their price point to the previous version 2 airpods ($199). For $50 more you get a lot more bang for your buck. Perhaps the most desired addition is the new Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which uses both outer and inner microphones to deaden sound around you. It works beautifully, and makes you realize how damn loud the world is on a regular basis. They are also IPX4 sweat resistant, which gives you piece of mind when working out or wearing them in a light rain. The in-ear design of the AirPods Pro means you’ll get much better sound quality compared to normal AirPods. Bass is deeper, voices are clearer, and there’s less of a tinny quality when you crank it up. Apple’s even got a fix for the “noise isolation” issue that affects in-ear headphones, which prevents you from hearing the world around you while listening to music with a snugly fit pair of earphones. Dubbed “Transparency mode,” the AirPods Pro use its ANC software and a pressure-equalizing vent to mix environmental noise with your audio. When it comes to Transparency mode, the AirPods Pro blow all of their competition out of the water. Where headphones attempting the same trick would give volume to silence or magnify sounds — making a running faucet sound like a hyper-localized downpour, for instance — the AirPods Pro makes everything sound, well, just as it should. Silence is (nearly) silent and conversations feel normal, without suffering from any delay or echo. While wearing them, I don’t feel the need to raise my voice a few annoying decibels in order to hear myself speak. One of the coolest new features is Audio Sharing, which lets you pipe audio from your iOS device to two different AirPods at once, essentially reviving the art of headphone-splitting, albeit in a less romantic manner. Bring the two AirPods close to the same iPhone, open their cases, and tap to pair and share. Instead of tapping your AirPods to pause a song or take a phone call, you’ll pinch the AirPods Pro on their protruding stem. This is powered by what the company is calling it a Force Sensor, essentially a pressure-sensitive button on the stem of each earbud. Holding either stem cycles through noise canceling options, and a trip to your iPhone’s Bluetooth settings lets you customize different tapping actions. Average listening time is about on par with regular AirPods, topping out at about five hours before you’ll need to charge. With the case, you can expect a full 24 hours of use. You can turn both Transparency mode and ANC off to get an extra 30 minutes of battery life. Of course, each upgrade of Apple’s AirPods has only gotten pricier, and the AirPods Pro are no different. At $249, they’re just as costly as noise-canceling earbuds from Bose or Sony. It’s also yet another “Pro” device from Apple lacking a USB-C port, opting instead to use the Apple-exclusive Lightning connector like the AirPods before it. But the AirPods Pro offer so much bang for your buck it’s hard to fault the wireless earbuds for much at all.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-06,Excellent all around earbuds,"Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700's, which I've been using daily for a couple of months so I'll compare to them. I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there's nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work. I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It's all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click ""connect"" in the bluetooth menu. Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn't seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don't use so I didn't test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no ""connected to xxx"" like the Bose does -- nothing else. For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won't be disappointed. Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It's hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they're fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I'm not sure why they weren't 100% if left in there overnight. There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can't control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it's okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface. There's no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it's been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There's a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it's hard to tell which mode you're in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice. Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don't have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I'll talk about in a minute. But there is also an ""off"" mode available only (that I've found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I'm guessing similar to previous AirPods. For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it's just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive. For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don't hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while. Would definitely recommend.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Neither is worth the difference between the cost of the AirPods Pro and the “plain” AirPods. The noise cancellation feature is practically non-existent. Try as I might, I could tell very little difference between noise cancellation mode and transparency mode. Outside noises came through loud and clear in both modes. It almost seems as if noise cancellation is achieved by stuffing the silicon tips of the AirPods Pro as deeply and tightly in the ear canals as you possibly can. Some folks ask if they can mow the lawn while wearing these. Well, of course you can, but don’t expect to hear much unless you crank the volume up to damaging levels. I thought the AirPod Pro was sweatproof. I was mistaken. They are sweat resistant. In the hot and humid South where I live and run, this product will have a short lifespan. I’m not going to gamble away $235 in hopes simple sweat resistance provides adequate moisture protection. You would think Apple would develop and release a sports version of AirPods. The sound quality seems about the same as the “plain” AirPods, so I see no reason in keeping the Pro model. Sorry, Apple.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-06,"The gold standard for now, but not perfect","Update: There are 4 things that I found helpful to new owners of these AirPods Pro. 1. Allow them to break in. They need about a day for them to sound their best. 2. Always start with the largest tips and work your way down. Use the largest tips that would fit you comfortably. 3. Tips can be difficult to remove. First, invert the silicone flaps, then pull firmly. 4. To remove the buds from their case, put your fingers behind them close to the hinge and then roll them forward towards you. How good are these new Airpods Pro? They’re good enough to be what other in-ears strive to be. First of all, like most headphones, these require some break-in. It took a few hours of using them before they started to open up so be sure to use it for a day before giving your final assessment. Now, I will try to answer a few key questions on people’s minds about whether or not to buy them. First, the big question on people’s minds, how do they compare to the regular AirPods? Well, they’re better. Not only in how they function in terms of noise-canceling but sonically. It’s not night and day in sound quality but the sound is more rounded and neutral. The bass is tight and accurate. They’re using what they call Adaptive EQ that automatically tunes to your ears which is probably why they sound better. The most common complaint people had for the old AirPods was that they didn’t fit. Well, these Pro should solve that issue. The old AirPods rely on how your ears are shaped in determining fit. The Pro only needs the hole of your ear canal to fit properly. They have 3 silicone tapered tips to fit all sizes of ear canals. I find the fit easy to accommodate with the 3 sizes and another great thing about Apple’s silicone fit tips is that they’re designed to be super compliant without a hard center. The squishy tips will easily conform to any shaped and sized ear canals. Unlike some other in-ear headphones, you won’t need to stick these way inside your ears either. I recommend that people start with the largest tips to try and then work your way down. You want the largest tips that can fit you as that allows the most comfortable fit without the need to jam it too deep inside your ear canals. One other worthy feature, the ear tip fit test works great. When I switched to the smallest ear tips, the fit test told me that they’re not making a good seal no matter how I adjusted them. They also seem to be nicely balanced to sit comfortably and securely inside your ears so that after some time you don’t feel them. I tried shaking my head to shake them loose to no avail, I got dizzy… zero movements on the Pro. The Pro has 3 settings for noise control: Noise Cancellation, Off, and Transparency. The Off setting is like any other in-ear headphones in that it offers some natural passive noise reduction just by the fact that you have something stuck in your ear covering your ear canal. The big difference here with the Pro is that Apple designed pressure equalizing vents on the silicone tips to reduce the underwater feel of traditional in-ear headphones. It does work, but not completely. It’s not going to feel like you’re wearing your old AirPods. I say it reduces that sensation by about 60-70%. The Noise Cancellation is really great. First of all, it completely eliminates low ambient noise. As I walk in the noisy New York City streets I can still hear stray sounds like loud trucks, jackhammering, and people shouting. But that sound is reduced by about 90%. I guess it’s good to still hear that as you don’t want to be completely oblivious of your surroundings. Plus, I’ve used noise-canceling headphones where they had such strong canceling waves that you can physically feel it as pressure on your eardrums. I don’t really notice this to be the case on these AirPods Pro as they’re not turned way up. The Transparency mode works as intended. It actually sounds like you’re wearing a hearing aid as the sound is piped in from the outside. Now, how do the 3 modes affect your music? The Adaptive EQ seems to work really well since sonically, there’s no difference between any of the 3 modes. That is, they sound the same except for whether or not you have Noise Cancelling (No outside sound in) or Transparency (Outside sound piped in) on or Off (passive noise canceling). It’s important to note that with the Noise Cancelling turned off, that mode had the most pronounced underwater (or fingers in your ears) effect of the 3 modes. Now, what about phone calls? Well, as far as I can tell, the people on the other side seems fine with it. What I hear from my end sounds a bit thin and flat. Hopefully, this will change with future firmware updates but as it stands now it’s not as great sounding as I’d hoped. I find that using Transparency mode for phone calls feels the most natural between hearing my own voice and that of the other caller. Taking a call with the Noise Cancelling on still sounds like having your fingers in your ears and hearing yourself speak. Finally, there are still some annoyances with these AirPods Pro. First, I find it difficult to remove them from the case. They’re slippery and because so little of it peeks above the case, I have to try many tries before I’m able to remove them. They could have placed a lip on the top surface of the AirPods for this purpose or even reduced the magnetism of the inside magnet so it’s not so strongly stuck inside the case. Second, Apple did a great job with trying to design an easy to replace silicone tips but the execution is a bit off. I found that I had trouble removing one of the tips as I didn’t want to use so much force as to tear the silicone cup. I finally saw the little vents which are little slits on the side of the tip that you can use your fingernails to pry it open. Also, I find that changing between the 3 modes lets out 3 distinct tones that are a bit too loud. Again, hopefully, that can be remedied with future firmware updates. Lastly, I think not having volume controls on the headphones is not convenient. Sure, you can always just use the phone or watch to adjust but what about using a turning gesture on the bottom of the AirPods, like you’re turning a volume knob? Perhaps they can add that to future versions?",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-08,First Impressions,"I am a bit of a headphone snob - not quite full audiophile, but somewhere between picky and high maintenance. I like quality headphones, but I don't often pay top dollar for them - thank goodness for Costco Specials and Black Friday. To help with contextualizing this review, let me provide the headphones that have been my go-to in the past (ordered by favorites). 1) Bose Sound Sport True Wireless ($200) - All around awesome earbuds, biggest pitfall is in style and battery life. 2) Sony Over-Ear WH-900N ($125)- Impressive battery life, sound quality, and noise cancelling. Best over ears for your buck. 3) Bose QC15s ($300, back in the day) - An oldie but goodie. 4) Apple AirPods 2 ($140) - Possibly the less competent cousin of the AirPods Pros? 5) Plantronics Backbeat GO 410 ($105) - Good sound quality, decent noise cancelling, annoying band. 6) Several JLab products ($20 - $75) - You have a 1 in 3 chance of buying something that actually works well with this brand. I stick primarily with familiar name brands - I don't venture off the beaten trail often. I am sure if you do enough research, you can find some truly exquisite headphones that only musicians know about. I am not that invested in my search for quality headphones, however. I want something that sounds great, looks decent, relatively durable, easy to use, and has excellent battery life. So far, Apple AirPods Pro fit the bill - beating the Bose True Wireless only because of style and battery life. Let me walk through some of the key features of these earbuds (you've probably heard some of this before). 1) Sound Quality - These sound pretty good. As far as I can tell, they share the same capacity for midranges as the Bose True Wireless. But, whereas the Bose tend to get muddy with high highs and low lows, I haven't noticed that with the Apple AirPods Pros. You also have the Adaptive EQ which, supposedly, listens to the inside of your ear as the sound raddles around, perfectly tailoring the sound (as you have balanced it) to your ear. Up until this point, I have only heard of one other pair of headphones boasting of this - Nuraphones (worth checking out if you have $400 burning a hole in your pocket). Biggest take away with sound quality - the Apple AirPod Pros are able to deliver sound as you have balanced them. Most people don't know how to utilize basic EQ functions in most music app or phone settings and so they write off a good pair of headphones because they haven't balanced them to their taste. I like my stuff a little bass-heavy, with high mids and low highs, which produces a warmer sound and the Airpod Pros deliver well on that. 2) Noise Cancelling/Transparent Mode. For earbuds, I think the noise cancelling offered is stellar - not perfect, but they're truly wireless earbuds. As with most headphones boasting of noise cancellation, the noise cancellation works really well for low to mid range repetitive sounds which makes them excellent for traveling. I used these headphones at a mall, in a car, and at the gym. They did well at minimizing or altogether removing those annoying sounds that tend to muddy up music (e.g. fans running, people talking from a distance, etc.) But! They do not cancel out, what I would describe as, random higher pitch sounds like clapping, children squealing, something clanking. Now, to me, I don't see that as a loss because usually those are sounds you want to grab your attention. Plus, to mitigate those sounds you typically want to focus on sound isolation aspects of headphones which have majority to do with how they fit. If there is a lot of sound leakage, then go up an ear tip size or readjust the earbud. The transparency mode is really cool - basically it enables the earbuds to delicately broadcast surrounding noise with your music. Essentially, this prevents you from being totally clueless of what's happening around you. I have found it to be a good balance too of ambient sound and my music - I get the best of both. 3) Battery life - There doesn't need to be a lot said about the battery performance of these earbuds. Truthfully, rarely will I ever go more than two hours without placing the earbuds back in their case to charge. Anything past that is great to me. The case boasts of 24 total hours of charging for the earbuds which is excellent. The quick charge is a nice touch, especially if you're heading to the gym and forgot to charge them the night before. 4) Comfort - Hands down, the most comfortable earbuds that I have worn have been my Bose True Wireless and they still are the best. I can wear those in any setting for hours on end and not grow tired of them. The Apple AirPod Pros are a significant step up in comfort from their predecessor. I can't ignore, however, that they are still essentially the same hard plastic with added rubber bulb ear-tips. This comes down entirely to preference, however. I like the cone-like shape of the Bose ear-tips. In the past, when I haven't liked a particular ear-tip style, I just find something musicians use by purchasing Shure foam tips with the same core diameter. Unfortunately, Apple wanted to be special and they decided to use a unique snap-on type fitting. Essentially, you're stuck with the ear-tips Apple provides. Now, I am not at all saying that the Apple AirPod Pros are uncomfortable - they just aren't my favorite. I've worn them several hours today alone and my ears are only slightly tired. Plus, they are secure enough to be worn at the gym. You have to keep in mind also that anytime you choose one thing, you loose out on something else. I could harp on the fact that the AirPod Pros don't have the same ear-tips as the Bose True Wireless, BUT the charging case is significantly smaller and more portable to carry than the large and awkward shaped Bose charging case. Charging cases are heavily dependent on the overall shape of the earbud, mostly the ear-tip or added comfort features. Just look at the Beats Wireless Pros, that case is a beast. All in all, I give the AirPod Pros a 7.5/10. As a whole, I am very satisfied with my purchase of these Apple AirPod Pros. I will admit, my first pair came in the mail with a dysfunctional right earbud. Aside from the fact that it was a major let down to an already delayed wait, it was an easy deal. I've always have good customer service at Apple stores and they happily replaced the earbuds for me. A few final words to an already long review... If you found this helpful, click the ""helpful"" button. These headphones are pack full of all kinds of cool features and are a nice blending of some of my favorite headphones. I still encourage diligent product research. The way I see it, Apple has two major audio competitors - Bose and Sony, both of whom make excellent headphones. Bose, you'll pay more. Sony, however, provides an excellent product for the price. I just bought my girlfriend a pair of $60 Sony earbuds that, as far as I could tell, sounded like something you'd pay $140 for. But, if you've got the money and you want the Apple AirPod Pros, then get them because they are pretty awesome.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I returned this third generation and went back and bought two used first generation airpods while they are still available. I figure there might never be another airpod that matches it.

Usually I am the type of person to Go out of my way to leave GOOD reviews. But after this years Apple problems, I feel it necessary to go out and let people know what they’re getting into. These are probably the worst headphones I’ve ever used in regards to any bass at all. My original AirPods have a much more rich and full bass spectrum. An utter and complete disappointment in regards to the full range of audio quality. I even did the “share audio”
Feature and kept swapping back and forth between the AirPod 1’s and the Pro’s. The originals not only have a much more fabulous bass response, they also have an altogether higher volume output. Some may argue that with noise cancellation that there’s no need for higher volumes... I won’t even touch that one right now. To be completely fair the noise cancellation works perfectly as does the ambient-noise passthrough feature. Choice. But I want an amazing AUDIO experience. I want my music to more than just “crystal clear.” I want it to be FULL and IMMERSIVE. These fall short terribly of a full high-quality audio experience. I gave 3 stars for battery life because if these are ANYTHING like my 11 Pro, I expect the battery to last less than my older generations of Apple tech, as that seems to be the trend of my luck with them. As someone who listens to a lot of electronic and bass heavy music, I’d like these to perform BETTER than the cheaper older models. I don’t think that’s too much to ask. I mean these are supposed to be a step up, correct? AirPods “Pro”... no “Professional” would use these for ANY type of audio engineering.

If you have issues with normal AirPods falling out of your ears these might be a little bit better. Even with that the right one specifically still get a little loose in my ears while running with all three different ear tips. If you want really good running specific earphones I would recommend the Powerbeats pro. With those headphones you loose the noise canceling but they universally stay better in the ears than the AirPods pro. ****Update:
My left ear bud has started to glitch a lot. There is now static, high pitched noises when laying down, and a weird popping sound when listening to music and watching videos every 5 seconds or so.

Although the new air pods pro cost more and sounds great with some extra features, I don't think it's for me. If I use it for less than two hours or so there won't be any problems as it preforms very well. The main problem is that if I wear them for over 2+ hours they start to hurt both my ear which is weird because the older models ""wired/wireless"" I have no problem with while they are in my ear all day long. ""I have tried changing the rubber from large to small still doesn't help."" It seems like the new design are a little thicker than the older generations.

Fit is snug and with extra tips, most of the people can get accurate fit. Make sure to run sound seal test from Bluetooth setting of AirPods. Each earpiece is about 1.25 inch, little shorter than earlier versions but they still stuck out of your ear and look little weird. Out of box, it comes with Airpods with wireless charging case, extra tips and USB-C to lightning cable. Note that it does not come with charging brick which is a bummer.

Well that's OK, that's why Walmart is in business - go clip some coupons and move along. OK now that those dullards are out of the way, lets talk about these headphones. I've had them for just over a week now and so far I'm loving them. I wouldn't by any means say they have the best quality I've ever heard - that wouldn't be close to true, but they do sound very good. The sound is very clean - very very clean - it just lacks that low end punch that I prefer. But if you use something like Amazon's HD music service and listen to some higher bitrate stuff, these really shine in just how clean and clear they are. Again, I don't like clean and clear as much as I like my head to hurt from the booming thumping bass, but these still sound very good - if not excellent. Noise cancellation... I've used a bunch of over the ear noise cancelling headphones - and flat out he Bose QB25 I have are better than the Airpods Pro. However the Airpods Pro are better than what I tried from Sony and Samsung. I've never used in-ear noise cancelling before, as far as I know there's only one other headphone that does this, an obscure Sony model. But having this feature is great for things like mowing the yard - it raises the lawn mower down in your life mix by a few notches, which is great. Overall, considering they're in-ear headphones, having this is a killer feature. Also the transparency mode is great, you can put it into this mode while out walking the dog or whatever, and you can still then hear your surroundings. This is very useful in my opinion. Battery life is fantastic. Since you're not going to be dumb enough to not have the case - you're basically not going to run out of battery life unless you try. The only read downside to me is the fit. They're a lot better than the awful hard plastic of the non-pro peasants version of these headphones - but the silicone covers aren't for me. They leave my ears sweaty after a couples of hours and I find myself needing to constantly adjust them because they're just not comfortable if I'm wearing them for over an hour. I can't wait until someone gets some foam tips to market, that will completely fix the issue as I had the same issues with silicone tips on every other in-ear headphone I've ever owned. Overall these are just an excellent package. I love all the features, the little stuff like Siri reading your incoming messages, the quick pairing with my iPad and MacBook - it's all very seamless and futuristic.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-11,Best Earbuds Ever!,"I have really struggled trying to find earbuds I actually like. I have a pair of wired ones that are really comfortable and sound decent--but the wire is a pain. I have another set of semi-wireless ones that are also comfy, but the sound is only okay, and they don't stay in my ears. I've tried super-expensive custom ones. And several other options. None of them hold a candle to these Airpods! The sound is fantastic, especially with the noise cancellation on. But I especially love that you can also put them on Transparency mode. I didn't understand from the description what the difference was between having noise cancellation off and Transparency mode, but when fiddling with them, I figured it out. Transparency mode allows you to hear outside sound MUCH better than just having the noise cancellation off! It's more like listening to a stereo or the speakers on your computer. A couple of other things I really love. The range is fantastic! With the other wireless earbuds I've tried, I have to stay in the same room as my device, but with these, I can walk throughout my house and still have sound! Amazing! Also, the little vents in them keep you from hearing your voice echoing weirdly in your head, as it does with other earbuds. Especially nice not to have to hear myself swallowing when I'm drinking a cup of coffee as I listen. I have super-sensitive ears, and the hard plastic part of these earbuds is a little uncomfortable for me. (I've never been able to tolerate other Apple earbuds because of this.) However, the silicone part is great, and it's possible I will get more used to them so that I'll be completely comfortable. I suspect others would not have this problem. (I returned the expensive custom ones I ordered because my ears didn't like the hard plastic even though it was customized for their shape, so this really is likely just a quirk of mine and not a problem with the Airpods.) Overall, I'm super-pleased with them and so happy I decided to take a chance on them despite my wariness of Apple earbuds.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Personally I was never a big fan of the bigger stem that the previous airpods had. Now with the Pros I really like the more premium/slim look they have going for them. When it comes to sound these won't blow you away, but once you turn on ANC they're a different headphone. It feels like the bass is more punchy and overall everything sounds cleaner. A much bigger improvement over the previous generations. There's also a transparency mode. I love it. I can have these on at work and still hear the work phone/ coworkers if need be. The battery life in general for most buds still needs work, but the charging case does wonders. I'll typically get about 4ish hours of sound and then put them in the charging case. I leave work at 4:30 and decided to put them in to charge at 4:13. When I left they went from 0-73% so I was really impressed by the fast charging.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-12,Best BT Earbuds on the Market!,"I've owned the original AirPods, AirPods 2, and now AirPods Pro. I read or heard the comment it's $50 more for the AirPods Pro over the wireless charging AirPods 2. Well, it's more like $85 difference now with the price drop. I'm not sure if it's temporary or not. Still are the AirPods Pro worth it? I would say yes. If you had trouble getting the previous models to fit or stay in your ears then it's a big ""YES!"". The Active Noise Cancellation works great. At first I thought it didn't work. I turned on Transparency and I can say with certainty it works incredibly well for earbuds. Is it perfect? No, there is some light sound leakage that I hear. If you have the volume past 60% or so, it's not really that noticeable. When walking. I have one earbud set to Transparency. Something not mentioned is how it ""feels"", when you have ANC on then off. It's a bit eerily or disorientating at first. You have to get use to it. It sort of feels like when I tried 3D glasses and took them off. You had to readjust for things to be ""normal."" Sound quality is better and it should be because it creates a seal, when you have them in properly. The controls are simple. Squeeze the stem on the earbuds to pause/play. Squeeze twice to skip. Squeeze and hold to turn on Transparency mode. Or if you're lazy then ask Siri. You can find the right fit with the ear tips optimization by tapping the Information icon in BlueTooth. It would have been nice to use foam tips but that won't happen for now. You're stuck with the Apple silicone tips due to the design. Things not mentioned in any or most reviews I read or watched online. A subtle change most users won't think about is that the speaker grille is not recessed like the previous models. Why does that make a difference? If you've used the previous generation of AirPods, things like ear wax, dust, debris get trapped in those areas making it pretty disgusting. Even Dr Pimple Popper might be offended by how gross it is. Not a problem anymore. Also, I recommend AppleCare but a smart tip is to buy it close to the 60 days after the purchase. That's the amount of time you have to get AppleCare. The shelf life of the earbuds is about 2 years or so. My first gen died about 18 months later, so definitely worth getting AppleCare since it's only $29.

The sound quality is great, coming from the bass heavier Bose Soundsport. These definitely sound great when you're on the go and in a noisy environment. The noise cancellation is good, but not Bose QuietComfort 35 (Over ear headphones) great. You do have to take this fact as a grain of salt, because once you see how tiny the AirPods Pro are, you'll be surprised at how these tiny sets of earphones can deliver such a good noise cancellation in a tiny form factor. In addition to the noise cancellation and sound quality, the battery life is great considering at just how tiny these are. I wish other competitors would offer better battery life in a tinier form factor. The size of the pods are just stupendously small, I would consider that as a pro and a con. In relation to its size, the battery life is still great, I'm able to go three days without having to charge these with varying light to heavy usage and charging them is quick even though they don't support USB Type-C power delivery. The only caveat to this product I would say is definitely the ways to charge it. Although it does come with a wireless charging case, I much prefer to charge them using a cable. Unfortunately these carry the proprietary lightning connector so you'd have to carry a USB Type-C cable and a lightning to USB Type-C cable too. As a person that used to only carry USB Type C cables, now I have to carry two types of cables for my iPhone and iPad Pro.

I pulled the trigger and awaited their delivery. Out of the box, they charged fairly quickly. They come enclosed in their charging case, which is about the size of a thing of dental floss. My main fear with this size charging case is that it would be fairly easy to lose. But I am not going to worry about that for now. As for pairing these with your devices - it is super easy. I literally took one bud out of the case near my phone, and my phone instantly recognized them. I was able to additionally pair with my ipad and apple watch with ease. For those, I simply just had to go to Setting, then Bluetooth, and press the button on the back of the charging case to pair, and they showed up in my list. Finally, it was time to put them in the ears and give them a whirl. And I was not disappointed! The sound was amazing, and the noise cancelling was very impressive for such a small device. You are able to toggle back and forth with the noise cancellation, by long pressing the button on the airpod (pressing once quickly simply pauses your audio). I work in a loud kitchen part time, and I can really tell the difference when I toggle back and forth between the two. It is truly amazing! These also are fairly comfortable for in ear phones.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2019-11-13,First time airpod owner and I'm impressed,"As a first time airpod user, I can definitely say these are worth your consideration. For reference, these have been used on a Samsung Galaxy s10 plus, so everything I've experienced is from a android phone. These airpods work like a charm and have no issues working in daily use. In my time using them, I've noticed the following:
Battery life: pretty darn good. I never use them until completely drained, instead until notified the battery is getting low. This normally happens between 5 - 5.5 hours of use. Fit: They will fit fine in your ear, very comfortable, and wont fall out on accident. Sound: I would rate the sound 7.5/10. I think when buying these, you are purchasing these for convenience and portability. The airpod pro sound maybe a step or two above the standard headphones that come with your phone. They are however excellent for phone calls. Build quality: The construction of the airpod pro is also good. I just wish apple would have made them of a matte color, as this glossy finish will scratch easy and is slippery to hold. Also, I wish apple would have made for more universal eartips. They seem proprietary, as in universal eartips wont work on these and as of this review, I cannot find alternatives elsewhere. Connectivity: Connecting to the s10 plus is simple and easy. You can walk a good distance from your phone, even with obstacles in the way, and the connection will stay secure. Only thing is that for android users, you cannot see the battery life without using third party apps, as that is a ios feature only. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): I would rate this a 8/10. When you activate it, the ANC is pretty darn good. It blocks out most noise you can hear, and anything it doesnt, is significantly muted, almost to the point of not hearing it. I have no complaints with it. I'd say overall, a good buy and worth looking into. The price is a tad high, so make sure this is what you want.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

the original airpods are using the same apple headphones tips, this meant that they are a matter of luck for you, if the design fits your ears (like my brother) then you are in luck. if they dont fit (like mine) then you are out of that luck. I thought to try if thinking that may be the wire is the reason, but not, stability in the ears and sound leakage were not good. hence my first return
then i went for the beats pro, and the beats pro had better sound quality, better stability in the ear, but their design was not good for me too, the shape of the headphones inside your ear cause me immediate pain after 10-15 minutes of use, and the over the ear hook caused me pain as well. Again, all of this is based on how my ears were shaped and hoe inflexible the headphones were. and i returned the beats pros too
Queue apple announcement of Airpods pro, and all the hype, I decided to try them, thinking that the shape of the in ear part looks different enough, and the reviews seemed positive. I'm happy to say that i am able to use the headphones without pain for more than 15 minutes, which is progress for me
there is few annoyances though
they are less prune to fall from my ear, but they do fall, which is not ideal
every time i put the headphones in the box, and i put them back in my ears, they default to noise canceling, which is not the desired mode of operation for me, I'm not sure how to change that yet. also, there is the issue of the way you put them in the box, one week later, I'm still not able to get accustomed to it.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2019-11-14,Active Noise Cancellation Not For Me,"I was very excited to try the new Airpods Pro, but unfortunately they are not for me. The main issue was the active noise cancellation (ANC). These were the first pair of ANC headphones I've owned, and it seems that I am in the minority of people who experience a strong negative reaction to ANC. Within moments of turning it on, I experienced head pressure, mild headache, and mild nausea. If you have never used ANC headphones before, be aware that the experience may not be as comfortable or magical as other say. Here is a breakdown of my thoughts on these Airpods:
The Good:
Fit: The fit was very comfortable and secure. I haven't tried the regular Airpods, but these fit great and seem very secure. Size: Both the Airpods and the charging case are compact and very portable. I have a pair of Bose Soundsport Free headphones and the charging case is at least 3 times larger than these. The mediocre:
Sound: Based on reviews, I expected these to sound better. In fact, I thought they sounded worse with ANC on than off. Overall, I think my 2-year-old Bose Soundsports sound better, which is maybe not surprising but a bit disappointing given the price for these. The bad:
ANC: Your mileage may vary, but I found using ANC a profoundly uncomfortable experience. I also felt like it did not cancel much more noise than having it off. Both of these factors negate one of the main selling points for these Airpods. Color: The Airpods and the case are dirt magnets. Even using them for less than a day, they were already picking up lots of dirt. I can't see keeping these clean in the long run. Overall: If ANC worked better for me, I could overlook the other shortcomings of these earbuds. As it is, I'll be sticking with my Bose Soundsports and sending these back.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Unfortunately (and ironically), the noise cancelling algorithm on these actually make the distractions worse. The AirPods Pro removes the white noise that had been masking conversations and abrupt sounds. With them in, it's actually harder to concentrate. I truly hope the magicians at Apple can improve the noise cancellation program via firmware update. It is not in the same league as Bose and Sony at this point. It is also not as customizable. As far as sound quality goes, I had been scared by other reviewers into thinking these were absolute garbage. I'm happy to say that's not the case. They are generally balanced and pleasant to listen to. The bass is present but not over-accentuated. The mids and highs are also present but not irritating. It's close to being good. There are better options out there, obviously. My favorite pair of wireless ears is the Bose SoundSport Wireless, which is, by the way, cheaper and more appropriate for working out. Apple's sound should have a bit more low frequency extension and more customizability. By the way, having a good tight fit in crucial to achieving proper low-end response on any in-ear headphone. So if the bass sounds weak to you, try a bigger tip and make sure to push it in snugly! As far as the mic, it's OK. It sounds about like you'd expect. Everything else works pretty flawlessly. The charging case is easy and intuitive. Putting them in your ears (one or both) is easy and intuitive. Pairing them was a breeze. They look pretty good too, if that's important to you. It's a 50/50 toss up now if I return them or not. I already have better sound in the Bose SoundSport Wireless, and these are not adding the noise cancelling functionality I was hoping for. UPDATE: It may be placebo effect, but I think the most recent firmware update really has helped the noise cancelling feature on these perform better. They are still not on par with Sony's technology, but it seems better. You just have to add a little noise from the Coffetivity app or the White Noise app to further drown out the office noise.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Unlike my Sony WH-1000XM2s, the transparency mode on these sound like I'm hearing outside sounds like the way they should sound, while the Sony's make it clear it's reproduced sound. Cons:
1. Easy to get dirty and scratch

Oddly, these keep falling out of my ears and I've tried the medium and large tips. The actual airpod itself is much bulkier, so I guess it just doesn't sit in my ear correctly. But that's not the only issue I have with these. I also bought them because they claim better microphone sound in the wind. Unfortunately, I done a few tests while biking slowly and I don't think there is much improvements. Oddly, I've also had people complain that they wouldn't hear me or was dropping out. It wasn't my signal because when switching to phone and back they could hear me just fine. I also really miss being able to tap the airpod to answer calls or hangup. Now you have to click on the short little stem, which I've had trouble doing. I tried for days to get this used to this, but no luck. What's worse, when I would finally find the right spot to click, it would cause the airpod to fall out. Yes, there is some sound improvement and the noise cancellation is nice (although I hate the strange hallow sound it creates when talking). But if you can't keep the airpod in your ear and you can no longer tap to answer/hangup, then I'm afraid the cost/benefit isn't there.

I was able to ""demo"" a pair at the The Apple Store. Which was nice, because it might take a couple of try's to get the best fit. They come with 3 different sizes of silicone gaskets to help maximize comfort and performance. After you get them situated, the AirPods will run a ""sound-check"" to confirm you have the best fit. More than anything, you'll appreciate the sound quality. The high-tech stuff is icing on the cake.

Granted, I do have some hearing loss so perhaps I'm missing out on some of the subtle sound differences. Although the left ear showed a good fit immediately, I had some problems fitting my right ear according to Apple's fit check. Eventually got it. Overall, very comfortable. Love the addition of the ANR as it makes sound pop and is great in an office environment to tone down background noise even if I'm not listening to music. Outgoing voice quality is very good over the phone based on feedback from others as well as listening to my voice recording. However, I find that the ear adapters seem to push the Airpods Pro out of the ear after 15 minutes or so (old Airpods didn't do this). This not only allows more outside noise in, but also sets them up to fall out during workouts or heavy head movement. Left ear fell out right at the end of a spinning class today as I got off the bike for example. I've decided to keep them for now and hope that other ear adapters become available soon.

And I wouldn’t have purchased them if I didn’t have a $100 amazon gift card I was saving for a special occasion. But I really couldn’t be happier with the product so far. I spent a week reading every review online and watching reviews on YouTube. I was struggling with the price but I was also desperate for a quality ear bud. I spent months trying various brands and then returning them. Either didn’t fit comfortably or poor quality. I wear these at work and at the gym. Never longer then 3-4 hours without a break but no discomfort to report and they stay firmly in my ear. One thing that could bother people is the bass level is average. I have zero problem with it. I don’t expect ear shaking bass on ear buds and frankly no one should. Sound quality for music and podcast is crystal clear and perfect for what I need. Battery life is solid and charge quickly when needed. If these were $100 cheaper I would be screaming from my rooftop to purchase them. Right now I tell everyone they’re great but over priced. Really depends on how comfortable you feel spending the coin on a ear buds. I am a little paranoid carrying them around. I feel like I’m transporting a gold bar and need to protect them with my life. Other positives I like are the ability to use only one and leave the other charging. Noise cancellation and transparency have been nice. Not earth shattering but again for ear buds you shouldn’t expect them to be but you will be pleasantly surprised. Also the syncing is fast which is hard to come by in some brands.

All 3 included tips do not work. I was gonna get a custom foam tip when they start making them because I felt it was worth it but..
2. 3 days ago I was caught up in the rain. I had my winter jacket on which is also waterproof. I know the airpods are water resistant but I was in no way going to test it out a week after I just received them, so I put a beanie on over my head covering the pods and then my jacket hoodie on over the beanie. Went throughout my commute no issues, but when I come home and take off my airpods I feel that they are a bit damp. Not wet by any means so I wipe them off and put them in the charger. Next time I take it out it no longer keeps a stable connection with my phone, the left earbud has an annoying hissing noise during transparency mode, and there's a ear splitting noise every so often that just makes it impossible to keep it in my ears.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-11-20,Outstanding (but very buggy)!,"I'm about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it's time to drop some comments. For context I'm coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones. I've also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro. == Noise Cancellation==
Noise cancellation in true wireless format are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones. I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel. Note for those of you who don't get the ""true wireless"" marketing term (I didn't and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don't have a wire between the two ear buds. Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn't entirely fair. The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I'd say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation. Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s. Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over. My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once. When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I've had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues. I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them. == Sound Quality ==
We buy ear buds to listen to stuff. I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie! Also serving the occasional phone call. I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories. The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent! Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close. My Anker headphones don't even compete. I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods. Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range. Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I've adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now. Mid and high range are superb! I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify's settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets. I decided the ""Flat"" setting is better with my Airpods. I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump. Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too. == Form Factor ==
Excellent! Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc.
These buds are really light and it's easy to forget they're in you ears! So tiny they're a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case. Apple provides three sizes of earpiece. They are made of soft comfortable material. I found I needed the large size. Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off. I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable. Be advised that there is a ""check fit"" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size. Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings. == Battery Life ==
I don't have these in all day but I'd say the specs Apple provides are pretty close. Maybe a little low. I've gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience. == Connectivity ==
CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing! Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near. That's not the amazing part. The amazing part is the range! My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal. I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site. I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track. I must've made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little. I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I'm impressed! == Surprise Feature ==
I wasn't particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor. Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here. While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn't really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature. It's really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again. Pretty slick! Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk. == Other Buggy Stuff ==
Apart from the things I've listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I've had a lot of other weird behavior. Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and had one bud fail to connect. Sometimes if I put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won't let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone). This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product. Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases. In general I feel like Apple's quality continues to degrade with every release. I get bugs are part of software (it's what I do for a living) but you don't release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product. Especially at this price point! My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly. Yea they're simpler functionality, but still. == Bottom Line ==
In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased! The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me. I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product. My only other wish is these were in the $150 range. That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don't work flawlessly. But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you're going to over pay on the expectation you're going to get a flawless top quality product. Didn't quite pan out this go.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-11-22,Best everyday headphones,"These are so much better than the origin and last generation AirPods! Here are reasons I love these for my everyday use:
1. The size of the stem is a lot shorter than the original AirPods design
2. The Active Noise Cancellation is a welcomed addition, with easy long press to enable/disable
3. No longer do you have to tap the earphone, you can just squeeze the either stem, which is better and less envasive
4. The sound quality is much much improved. There is actually bass now! Its not rocking base, but there's at least some semblance of it now. 5. Comes with different sized silicon ear things. These stay in your ears a lot easier than the last generation design. 6. The charging case is redesigned, wider and shorter. 7. The battery life is amazing! The only downside is there is no ""quick"" switching between iPhone and MacBook. Not only that, there is a known issue with the MacBook pro where if you use the AirPods microphone, it switches the sound codec to SCO, which is horrible for music! The workaround, until there is a fix from Apple (if ever), is to set your laptop's sound output to your AirPods and the input to the Mac's internal mic. Overall, as an entire package, I'm really happy with these and find that I'm using it more than any other headphone.

I am retuning them because the ear fit test stopped working first on the right one and then on both. There is an audible buzz in my right earbud when I talk to Siri or on the phone and the noise cancelleation was sporadic (probably due to ear fit). Apple replaced right earbud to no avail... If I weren't a long-time Apple geek I wouldn't have kept them as long as I did. Powerbeats pro that I bought at same time are FANTASTIC, but have no active noise cancellation. Very disappointed customer and disenchanted with Apple Support for first time. I’ve had these for 3 or 4 days & have used them about 35 hours. My appreciation for them has grown steadily. I had some trouble with the fit early on (they would pass the seal test,but were not stable in my ears. I was ‘underwhelmed’ by the noise cancellation UNTIL I got the correct fit w/largest silicone tips. Then with the correct fit; the world just vanished when I turned on noise cancelling. I’m able to listen to music at 50% volume instead of the 80%+ w/AirPods (originals). The sound is improved in bass end & overall balance & staging are exceptional. The seamless pairing & operation with my iPhone X & Apple Watch make for a perfect integrated system.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2019-11-23,Disappointing,"I've been an unlikely fan or the Airpods since the first version was released as Apple earphones have never fit my ears but something about the weight and lack of cable was perfect combination and I've never had a problem with keeping them in my ears. Version 2 was even better with improved battery life, range and the addition of ""hey Siri"" functionality. I was understandably excited when the Pros were announce and picked a set up day one. I tried for three weeks to like them, but eventually returned them. 1) They don't fit my ears. I tried with all three different tips but everytime the moment I started jogging *pop* out they went. Never had this issue with the non-pro models. Weight could also be a factor here as they weigh twice as much as the earlier models. 2) Sound Quality is good, but not 100 dollars more good. I'm sorry but they just aren't. Compare these to the similarly priced true wireless sets from Bose or Sony and the SQ is night and day. 3) Noise cancelling is ok at best. They are better than nothing but again compared to the Bose and Sony models leave much to be desired. 4) The controls are a huge step backwards from the Tap controls of the non-pro's. Squeeze-and-hold is beyond dumb for a tiny plastic nub hanging from your ear. Invariably I found myself pulling the stupid things out of my ear while trying to pause or skip a track. Looking at the casing there is no reason why Apple couldn't have retained the tap controls of the previous model. This was a design choice, a bad design choice. Long story short these Pro's fall far short of the mark. Everything I've mentioned above could be corrected in the next model, which I am hoping will happen, but for now I won't be recommending them to anyone.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The ear tips are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be for extended wearing and also hold them in place. With older AirPods design they would fit but when moving around and even just talking (moving your jaw) they would wriggle from their set position. Also, I didn't care for the loud sound pressure transferred to your eardrum when tapping to issue commands either of the older generation units. These new Pro model buds have a pressure sensor on each bud stem you press/pinch to activate features. They make little single click/tick sound when pressed. One press for Play/Pause/Answer/Hangup, Two-presses for next track, Three-presses for previous track. So far the best feature is noise cancellation which is fantastic. Calgon, take me a away. The peacefulness is bliss. The only nag I have so far is with the shorter stem they can be a little fumbly putting them into and getting them out of the charging case. I haven't had them long enough to test call-quality (both audio and microphone quality) but will update if anything comes up. I did make sure the firmware updated to latest version as I've heard others speak of microphone call quality with original/shipping firmware version, so I am interested to see if this new version resolves it. All in all I can highly recommend them and will come back and either bump rating to 5 stars or keep it at 4.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-11-26,AirPods vs AirPod Pro Review: My experiences,"If you’re thinking about these and currently own the original style of AirPods, please check out my review below! Are these a replacement to the original AirPods? Not necessarily. I own these and two original style AirPods. I am an Apple fan girl and own one of everything they’ve got. But even then, I’m on the fence about the Pro’s. First off...
Comfort and Fit
If you’ve ever tried out the PowerBeats by Dre, they fit just like them minus that extra ear anchor. It takes some getting used to but thanks to transparency mode, I don’t think I could really wear another pair of IEMs / earbuds again. They 100% will not make you feel like your ears are clogged and not can you hear your own voice as one would with earbuds. However, I’m hung up on the fit. I was one of the lucky few who the original AirPods fit just right. However, these just hurt after 20-30 minutes. I tried all the different sizes of ear tips but none work. Ultimately, I wish Apple included foam versions of their ear tips. So be warned that these might hurt! Assuming they don’t hurt, then...
Sound Quality
The sound quality is great. It’s nice and clear, balanced and at times not packing the bass I was possibly expecting. The HomePod has a very, very strong bass signature and I thought these would be similar. But, nope! When third party foam air tips come out, I’m pretty sure that will help the bass out. (Bass needs a good seal when it comes to earbuds.) Are these better than the original AirPods? Maybe. Because of that seal from the ear tips, the sound quality is drastically improved. With third party ear tips, the original AirPods sound pretty similar to these. I do appreciate the dynamic EQ which helps the sound a lot. But, be warned that they will sound like garbage if you have an EQ set in Apple Music on your iPhone. Make sure to set it to off or Late Night, otherwise they’ll sound a lot worse! Ultimately, you won’t be disappointed and they sound great, better than the originals because of that sound seal, but not mind blowing! Battery Life
They’re pretty in par with the original AirPods with battery life even with Transparency and noise cancellation on. You can go all day with these just like the originals! Speed
This is what I love about them the most! This is the reason why I prefer these over the original AirPods. The Pro’s are so much snappier with Handoff, switching from device to device, pausing and restarting, etc. They also more accurately get picked up by your iPhone and Apple Watch. I really wish they would upgrade the hardware in the original design just like these. (We’ll see!) also, the Pro’s more intelligently go on standby when out of your ear, resume faster when they go in your ear, etc. They just do everything faster! I also appreciate the fact that you pinch the stem instead of tapping them. Whoever thought of tapping didn’t realize how uncomfortable that “gesture” would be in practical usage. Overall
I love them but they’re like the cousins of the original AirPods. They’re not a replacement but a different flavor. These are great for working out and stay in my ears during running. The new features and speed in combination with the improved sound delivery makes them an easy upgrade — so long as you find them comfortable, that is!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These are hands down the best wireless ear buds on the market. Sound quality is extremely good for this category of headphones. The fit is great as well, which I enjoy since the original AirPods did not fit my ears. They have not fallen out even while running. They connect seamlessly to any Apple device thanks to the H1 chip, and they still work with android and windows devices. The ANC works great. I use it in loud cafeterias and cafes and the ambient noise is greatly minimized. It even lowers the noise of my roommates snoring to a manageable level. The transparency mode is a lifesaver when you’re crossing the street or running down the road. They feel light and airy, unlike other headphones. My only issue with them is that I don’t think they’re worth $250, considering that all wireless earbuds only last about 2 years due to their battery. However, if you really want the best wireless earbuds on the market, these are them. The Sony ANC earbuds are also worth a look if you don’t care about seamless pairing with Apple devices.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

You may ask yourself “why would he make these crazy sacrifices”? That is because I hate in ear headphones and everything I hated about them Apple fixed. As I stated previously I can not fit AirPods unless I mimic a corpse and sit perfect still but the AirPods Pro fit me PERFECTLY. I absolutely HATE the feeling of something being deep in my ear canal and poking against my eardrums and this is a feeling that most if not every in ear headphone offers. They all offer this EXCEPT the AirPods Pro, somehow and someway Apple made in ear headphones that don’t go in your ear, well at least they don’t feel as if they do because they are super comfortable and don’t offer that ridiculously uncomfortable feeling of something being deep in your ear and knocking on the door of your eardrum. Don’t ask me how they did, but they did it. The next reason why I despise in ear headphones and refused to wear them is because when you put them in and created that seal it’s almost like you can hear your brain working, it creates an almost underwater like feeling, but again somehow, Apple was able to mitigate if not completely eliminate that feeling. The 2 main reasons I can not wear in ear headphones are gone, but that’s not it, there’s more. The sound quality and profile is incredible, these sound WAY better than the OG AirPods and the noise cancellation which I could personally care less about, makes the world disappear right before my ears.

The case fits on your person, in your coin pocket, where Bose/Sony take up an incredible amount of packing space in your bag. They also require external charging...
Speaking of charging in a pinch, you can extend their battery life by using one ear pod at a time, L or R, while charging the other. Also, you can pop them back in the case for 5 mins, and get about an hour extra listening time!! Apple has made it easy to switch the ANC/OFF/Transparency mode easily, in control center, from your Apple Watch or on the stem of the earpod itself. Transparency mode is a wonderful addition. You can have (but maybe shouldn’t) a conversation w/o removing your AirPods. But most importantly you can listen to your surroundings (newborn mom here, always on the listen), or during a bike commute, where you need to everything going on around you.

The noise cancellation and transparency mode are great. The sound quality is very good. Despite this, I most commonly carry my old airpods instead of these. The reasons are: (a) the case is smaller on the old airpods (it is more pocket friendly) and (b) the new piece fits well in the ear canal, but doesnt fit as well with my ear (the unique shape of the old airpods kept them in my ear even though they arent in your ear canal)
If I really need great sound and noise cancellation, I will carry my Sony over the ear headphones. I keep my old airpods on my key chain for convienence. The new ones are just a bit big for that. If I am travelling or working somewhere public or noisy I will use my Sonys. Therefore, my airpod pros will likely sit in the drawer. Update: If you chew gum, it will pop them out of your ear.

Bass and mid-range is vastly improved from the AirPods. The fit tool works very well - I trusted it and switched back to the the medium plug from small in my right ear (could not run or walk using my AirPods, right ear is problematic with most brands of earbuds) and it worked perfectly during my run. These are made for the gym, so nice to block out all the background noise. Switching between cancellation and transparency modes gives you an idea of how much noise they block out.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2019-12-05,Essentially non-working product,"I wanted to like these, I really did. I have the original AirPods and I absolutely love them. But they were lacking in a few ways, primarily in no noise cancelation and they (supposedly) are not sweat resistant. I use them for conference calls at work and when I work out (to listen to music) so those features (or lack thereof) are pretty important to me. When I first heard about the AirPods Pro they seemed like the bridge that closed these gaps and I was willing to pay extra money to get them (even more than usual since the 3rd party I purchased from thru Amazon was selling them at marked up price of $299). Sadly, they effectively do not work. The sound quality is good enough and the noise cancelation is noticeable when compared to the original AirPods; nothing that really wowed me but an improvement. The deal breaker for me is that they will not stay put, no matter which size I use or how I position them. I put them in for a conference call and as I talk they begin to push out eventually popping out of my ear completely. I put them in to wear around the house while listening to music and without any movement in my face at all, they still eventually popped right out. I haven't tried them while working out because the last thing I need is for one to pop out while I'm running and fall under foot to get crushed. I didn't want to rule out that my ears are the defective ones, so I let 3 other people try them: popped them in their ears (tried each size), talked for about 3 minutes, POP! out came the AirPods each and every time. Ear buds that don't stay place during extremely common use are, essentially, a defective product in my opinion. A few other flaws to mention, that weren't necessarily dealbreakers on their own: 1. There are currently no Apple approved protective cases so you have to go with pretty cheap cases on Amazon; considering how pricey the AirPods are this might be a problem for some people so wanted to mention it. 2. They are extremely difficult to get out of the case because of the size/ shape of them; I had to turn the case upside down and tap them out. 3. They are not at all comfortable. I would not need to wear them for extended periods of time so this would've been okay if they actually stayed put the way ear buds need to. I'm a devoted Apple fan, perhaps to a fault; I was so excited for this product and really hate to rate them so badly. But they just don't cut it as the product they claim to be; certainly not at the price you pay for them. I'll keep my fingers crossed the future iterations of the AirPods pro work.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-12-05,Eh. not worth $270,"The noise cancellation isn't the greatest. Of course, our expectations for the noise cancellation won't be similar to Sony's wh-1000xm3 be we should expect it to be pretty decent right? It's not. People have had concerns about the if listeners would hear a car or train coming up behind them but listeners have nothing to fear. In a relatively quiet room, the noise cancellation sounds great. Any fans, AC noise, etc is canceled out. However, once you start going about your day, outside noises can still be heard while having the volume 2/3 of the way up. Now that is assuming that the pros are able to stay in your ear. I tend to smile a lot throughout my day and sadly when I do, the airpods slip out. I tried both the medium and the small buds to see if my problem would be fixed. It wasn't. Compared to the gen 2 airpods, the pros have great additions. The noise cancellation and the replacement of the buttons used in previous generations are great. However, the pros do lack when it comes to fit, noise cancellation, and price. Additionally, they are not the prettiest. The short neck looks awkward and out of place. I recommend that you try before you buy. Go to an Apple store and ask one of the representatives if you can try on the pros before you buy them. Also, ask them to clean them beforehand. Perform a variety of head movements (depending on how confident you are in public you can try headbanging, head shaking, running in place, etc etc) to make sure that they fit properly.

If you're an apple/iOS user, Airpods are a no-brainer. I didn't love the originals, the battery life wasn't great. They'd be cooked on a 2 hour conference call before the call was over. 90 mins in you have to pull one pre-emptively and place it in the case to catch a charge then swap. I figured these would be the same, but they are considerably better. For comparing the original release w/o wireless charging case, if the second gens have a better battery life then this may not apply. But with the Pro's I can easily stay on a 3+ hour call (sounds fun doesn't it?) w/o having to charge them. The noise-canceling is nowhere near as good as Bose over the ear, maybe not even as good as the Amazon Echo buds. but it's adequate. I haven't taken them on a plane yet but they easily cancel out basic background noises. Anyone that tells you they don't hear people sitting next to them or loud traffic is smoking crack. None really cover-up that type of noise. I will buy these again when I lose one. That is the biggest downside. They are slippery but so are the originals. That's all I have to say.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-08,Best signal to noise ratio I have ever heard.,"For background, I am a recreational music producer and have typically used studio monitor setups ranging in price from $400 to over $1000. I have also owned a variety of Bose products including the QC15 noise cancelling headphones and multiple generations of SoundSport earbuds. I listen to at least 2 hrs of music a day. The listening experience on these earbuds vastly exceeds the Bose products I have owned and also rivals my professional grade KRK studio monitors. I will break down my review into a few categories:
SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO
The signal to noise ratio of these earbuds is truly exceptional. I have never heard any headphone or studio monitor with anywhere near as good of a signal to noise ratio. I am hearing details in music that didn't even come through clearly on my KRK studio monitors. NOISE CANCELLING
The noise cancelling is very good. Better than my Bose QC15s (headphones!) which were the industry standard years ago (granted, I haven't tried recent leaders like the Surface or Bose QC35s because I don't own them). For earbuds, I am impressed at how well they can block out sound. FIT and SEAL
I have average size ears so I chose the standard ""medium"" ear tips. My right earphone stays planted, but my left earphone slowly slips out over time. I believe this is due to the shape of my ear. They're not the most comfortable earbuds I have used because they have to press against your ear to make a good seal. After about an hour of listening I'm ready to take them out of my ears for a bit. FREQUENCY RESPONSE
The AirPods Pro have a pretty good frequency response. Mids are very clear and highs are sharp but are not piercing which is not easy to do. Bass is surprisingly a little heavy.. And I have a 1500W subwoofer in my car and a 8"" KRK sub connected to my studio monitors. So I'm a bit surprised at how much bass Apple decided to put in these. It's not at the point that it's distracting but I would say it's a little more low end than would be present in monitor grade equipment. For reference I listen to Hip Hop and Electronic music that tends to place a lot in the low end. TRANSPARENCY MODE
The transparency mode uses the microphones to amplify ambient sounds if you want to be more connected with the world around you such as when in an office where you might be approached. It definitely works. It sounds a bit artificial and not quite like real life but it surely helps hear what is happening around you. I would say this is not the setting to use for the best listening experience. Noise cancelling mode really helps engulf you in the music and is my preferred listening mode. CONVENIENCE:
Pairing to Apple devices is a breeze. I have a Mac, iPad, and iPhone and it is very quick to switch between them when I need. I have not tested connectivity on other devices, but it should work just fine as a normal bluetooth device for other equipment. OTHER
For some reason I thought these came with an app that would allow EQ modifications but they do not. Luckily the standard tuning is pretty balanced but like I said the low end is a bit inflated. Overall, these earbuds exceeded my expectation for the price point and are worth every penny. I am very happy with these!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

This is popular in North America, and wearing it has become a fashion. I think it is the best electronic product after iPhone and Echo in the past 10 years. iPhone 4 Steve Jobs 2010
Echo Jeff Bezos 2014
Airpods Pro Tim Cook 2019
1. It is suitable for sports enthusiasts. Airpods Pro has a new anti-sweat function, so you don't have to worry about sweat damaging the headphones during exercise. Noise reduction function can isolate external sounds, so you can enjoy music at the same time
2. Battery life. I tested the battery box for about 16 hours, and the headset has less than 5 hours. The noise reduction function may consume more power. 3. It's not suitable for sleeping. When you wake up, you may find headphones everywhere. In addition, when the power is off, the beep is very annoying. It is recommended that friends who want to sleep use sleep earplugs. 4, I found that the low-frequency sound quality will be more impactful and fuller than Airpods 2, but the overall sound quality is not much different from Airpods2
Old review:
I give this product 4 stars. I got this product before Black Friday and have been using it for 10 days. Here is my experience using headphones
Appearance: 3 stars
1.The surface feel is the same as the previous two generations, and it is easy to scratch. It is recommended to buy a third-party protective case or a charging case with a protective case. 2.Portability personally feels better than the previous two generations, because the appearance is flatter and the earstems are shorter
3. There are three sizes of earbuds. The default is medium size. The little ears are still a bit painful after wearing them for a long time. Changing the trumpet is much better. The silicone sleeve is not easy to remove and replace. In addition, the silicone of the earphones is a bit smelly. 4. Uneven gaps are found in the charging case. I don't think there should be any problems with the workmanship of the product at this price, so the appearance is only 3 stars. Comfort: 4 stars
1. In-ear AirPods Pro is not as comfortable as non-in-ear AirPods. 2. At present, it has been about 40 hours with earphones. It is said that there are stomata to regulate air pressure, so there will be no pressure in the ear for a long time. Ear pressure balance is better than Bose
3. AirPods Pro will have better air tightness to the ears. Sony WH1000XM3 will have some air leakage, but Sony WH1000XM3 is a headphone. Among in-ear active noise cancelling headphones, AirPods Pro may be the smallest and integrated The highest degree and the most complete function
4, running without worrying about falling, squat without worrying about pressing the neck. Its presence is much stronger than AirPods. You ca n’t expect to wear it for a long time like AirPods before. You will forget its existence. In fact, it will always support your ears to remind you of its existence. One advantage is that compared to AirPods, AirPods Pro is stronger and harder to drop. For sports-loving users, AirPods Pro will be more suitable for you. 5 stars
1. Active noise reduction is the biggest difference between Pro and AirPods 2. AirPods Pro has three noise reduction modes, namely noise reduction on, off, and transparent mode. The official said that Apple ’s innovation in transparent mode, but I see other brands (Samsung, Sony) The headset also has a similar function. 2, AirPods Pro's noise reduction is not as good as Sony WH1000XM3 on-ear noise reduction headphones, but it is the best among real wireless headphones. As for how to achieve such an obvious noise reduction effect in such a small volume, I don't understand. The intuitive feeling is that the noise reduction effect is obvious. 3, I can feel quite quiet on the road, so it is strongly recommended to use noise reduction off or transparent mode on the road. Sound quality 4 stars
The AirPods Pro's sound quality has not been significantly improved compared to the previous generation of AirPods
Summary: This is an excellent headset. If you value the noise reduction function more, it is suitable for you. But if you are more concerned about the sound quality and have no need for noise reduction, I suggest you buy AirPods 2, because AirPods 2 is cheaper. In addition, the charging box and headphones must not be lost, the official charging box and headphones accessories are expensive",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2019-12-12,Used for cardio in the gym.,"I had the Bose Bluetooth ear buds and they were pretty big and bulky. Being so big, they had a tendency to fall out during running on a treadmill. I elected to buy these in hopes that they would stay out during my running on the treadmill. I am a bit of a sweater so ear buds have a tendency to always not want to stay in. These do not sounds quite as good as the Bose did but that was to be expected. The noise cancellation is pretty good. The battery case is way smaller than the Bose and I like that. Back to the fit, one of my Air Pod Pros does not like to stay in. I do have to constantly push it back in and refit it. That is a pain. This is probably just my ear though. Connection to any Apple device is a breeze. Like all Apple products, they just work. Would I recommend them? That is tough. I like them enough that I bought some for my wife for Christmas. I would have to say that I do recommend them and caveat that by saying I am hoping for some sort of ear clip that some aftermarket manufacturer will offer for these to ensure they stay in on my cardio workouts.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-12,"Yes, it's very very worth it.","Where do I even start. These AirPods are probably one of the most impressive pieces of design I've ever seen. They are so much better than the original AirPods. The $100 price difference is too low - I would've paid more for these features if I knew how good they were. 1. Transparency Mode. This is amazing. Lets you hear more than you can physically hear with your ears blocked. You can listen to music and still hear the coworkers next to you. You can walk across the street and hear oncoming traffic (you should still look both ways). You can go to the gym and listen to music while not being completely closed off from the rest of the gym. It literally flows the outside sound into your ear. So even with your ears completely sealed off with the earbuds, you can hear better than you would if you used the original airpods. 2. Noise cancelling. In my opinion, when Apple does something they do it right. The moment noise cancelling turns on it sounds like you're in your own world. The difference is not slight or somewhat there.. it's staggering. I can't even hear myself swallow food or chew. I can't hear myself run. I can't hear anything except my music. 3. Squeeze instead of tap. The airpod pro gestures are really great. Tapping was nice but it was gimmicky and it didn't work perfectly. I frequently needed to tap twice to get things to work. Sometimes I tapped too many times. Squeezing is more deliberate. it makes it so you know what you're doing and you can feel exactly what the headphones are responding to. It makes the gestures so much more reliable. 4. Sound quality! I compared these headphones with my pair of wired V-MODA Zn's. If you don't know of that brand, it's a medium-priced luxury audiophile pair of headphones. It's wired, so it will naturally be able to achieve better sound quality than Bluetooth. These headphones exceed the sound quality of any BEATS headphones you can find. In comparison to the AirPods, I would say that AirPods are only slightly lower in quality. That is an incredible achievement, because for me the Zn's are the pinnacle of sound for anything under $300. So I would say that the sound quality is pretty damn amazing. All in all, this is a luxury item. You don't NEED these features, but when you get these earphones you're going to have an incredible time.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Very disappointed in the noise cancellation. I’ve worn these on a plane and they only cancel out about 60% of the engine noise. I occasionally work in a large data center where there’s a consistent equipment hum of about 84 decibels, and I estimate that these are only blocking out about 75% of the noise. The noise cancellation software needs some serious updating. The sound transparency mode is pretty good so that you can hear people talking and sounds around you. There’s just a slight filtering of the sound, so it’s not completely transparent. Good enough to leave the EarPods in and still hear what’s going on around you. The BIG downside to these are that the EASILY fall out!! I’ve tried the different sized ear tips, and ran the Air Pods Pro sound/noise cancellation tests and I’m using the correct size tips. On a plane, I nodded off for a bit and woke up to a missing AirPod. I had to wait until the plane landed and everyone got off to search for the AirPod. It rolled a few rows back winding up under a seat with a bunch of garbage and dirt. On a return trip, I put them in, and within 5 minutes, one fell out again. Forget about moving around with them in, as they will definitely fall out. If you bend over, they fall out. You will find yourself constantly pushing them in to avoid losing them. I had to buy a silicone strap to keep the two attached to each other so the don’t venture off. The use of the strap is ridiculous, and shouldn’t be necessary, but I don’t feel like buying a replacement AirPod and wasting more money. The battery charge lasts at least five hours, and charges quite quickly in the included charging case. Overall, save yourself about $200 and spend $50 on a decent pair of wired ear buds, which will have the same audio quality. A very disappointing purchase! !",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2019-12-14,Overhyped and Overpriced,"I got these for my wife as a graduation gift because she was all over them when they got announced but ended up returning them after we both used them for a few weeks. As a lover of other apple products, I can’t get along with these either. Regular airpods fall out of my ears, these are so big they irritate them no matter how I twist them, and her complaint was the same, after an hour they hurt. Sound quality is good, but my $30 buds sound damn close and these certainly aren’t 8x better. Noise cancelling is legit, definitely a win with these and probably the only feature I thought was good. I also had problems pairing to my iPhone, but they work fine with my wife’s iPhone and MacBook, we both run the same software too. If I open the case next to my phone it would not recognize them unless I manually went into Bluetooth settings and paired them like my cheap earbuds. Also the lack of volume control on the buds is a huge fail on Apple’s part. Overall just not impressed, especially for the price, I know the overall package is nice and so is noise cancelling, but I can’t forgive that these cost $250 and sound only marginally better than my 2 year old off-brand $30 buds. One final issue is that their case is poorly designed. The lid doesn’t click into place firmly when open so the smallest handling error and the lid wants to shut. This happens more than you’d think considering how far the buds sit inside the case and how hard they are to pull out, often falling out as they slip from your fingers. When the lid is closed it rattles and twists back and forth like some cheap dinky piece of plastic.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The key issues I have with airpod pro is lack of a mute button and volume button. I have to control from phone and if phone in pocket then an issue. For a small pair of earphones I was impressed how well they worked to cancel noise on a plane. Did a great job blocking announcements. In some frequencies they block better than my sony XM3. However, sound quality and bass way better on the Sony XM3. Call quality listening is excellent. People heard me well. Noise cancellation turned on in the ios accessibility setting. Did not block out noise well to prevent others from hearing noise around me—Plantronics excelled there—could be in heavy street noise and no one would hear it. As for blocking noise while listening on a phone call it was great—part of this could be just the fact the speaker fits snugly in ear canal. I use one ear bud a lot for calls since I like my other ear open to hear surroundings. Then when one battery is low, swap them out and have charged one and one charging in case. This switch is seamless and automatic. Use two ear buds for when not moving and listening to music in the office since the bulky XM3 just looks awkward. Great for blockimg out noisy people in the office—dead silence! However, also means people can startle you easily since you will not hear them—use the force:). Fit is great, comes with some different size ear tips to try. Just ensure pushed in tight and will stay in as you move and give better sound. I wish these came in black. Another frustration is when I get in car my phone switches from air pod to car audio automatically.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-16,Well deserved FIVE Stars.,"The reviews are right on target...these ear pods are quite remarkable! The technology that went into creating very good sound quality, good comfort and very easy and flexible setup is amazing. Normally I haven’t been comfortable wearing and of the EarPods Apple have sent me with iPhones in the past. An hour at best and I was happy to remove them. These I can wear and have worn for three hours with no need to remove them. Sound wise they aren’t going to make me throw away my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones or even my pair of ten year old Sony Open Ear headphones. But the sound is perfect for background listening of classical orchestra and piano. I love them in the background while reading, doing desk work and even taking my daily hour long outdoor walk. I mostly use transparency mode especially when walking outdoors where safety is a factor. And indoors I don’t need noise quieting. A big advantage with these Ear Buds is the freedom of movement and long playing time. My main music source is an Apple 11 Pro iPhone and an app I found online with streaming classical music. I also have a number of downloaded music from my Amazon Prime and use this outdoors where I have no internet. All in all...five stars. My only concern is expected lifetime (two years...maybe?).

I must have dozens of various designs and brands. I also love my AirPods 1. The AirPods Pro take a lot of time to get the right fit and the fit is paramount to these working for you. They can sound powerful or weak, depending on how they fit. They can also hurt like heck in the ear after even a fit minutes if the fit is too tight. Ironically, I liked the way that the originals fit - not too tight and not too loose. I now sometimes reach for the originals when noise cancellation is not that important. Note also that there is a very 'negative pressure' sound to these, similar to the earlier Bose QuietComforts. The sound from the Pros is better when they work, no doubt. Finally, I do not like the way Apple has made the interactions with the Pros. I do not like having to press the pod stem to forward, reverse, start, etc the song. I liked the originals with the tapping of the pod.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2019-12-17,Finally an Apple Earbud worth owning,"I bought the original AirPods when they first came out, put them in for a minute was shocked with the horrible sound quality, then immediately took them out, boxed them up and returned them. The original AirPods sound like garbage and look ridiculous. I'd been waiting for them to update them with a proper ear bud design that has ear tips and noise cancelation, and finally they're here. These sound 1000X better than the original AirPod and look far less ridiculous in your ears. These are by and far the best earbuds I've ever owned. Now of course they're not perfect. For starters the sound quality isn't on par with what I'd expect from such an expensive pair of earbuds and honestly my $30 wireless Anker earbuds sound better, but the sound is perfectly good enough. The noise cancelation is a nice feature to have but isn't as good as over the ear headphones. Since they also have passive noise cancelation, you can't really tell the difference in many cases when you're listening to music. The transparency is also quite nice, but needs improvement. While you can hear as much as you could without the earbuds in, it just doesn't sound the same and isn't easy to hear voices. Where these really shine is the ease of use. They connect very fast and are very easy to swap between devices, two things that my cheaper (better sounding) earbuds aren't able to do. The design is quite nice, the case is very small, and they are very comfortable. The wireless charging case is very nice to have. The controls are also much easier to use and feel really nice to use. The original AirPods were very hard to control, and other earbuds rely on pushing a button, which can be painful in your ears. Honestly $250 is a lot to spend on ear buds, especially since you can buy other wireless earbuds on Amazon for under $50 that sound just as good or better, but it's all the little refinements on these that make them well worth the price. I just hope I don't lose one :)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-22,A COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINALS,"Compared to the original AirPods, the form factor of the case and the earbuds just look awkward, but the functionality is great. This is the kind of the ugly older brother to the originals that is more powerful. TRANSPARENT MODE
To me,the best feature is the “transparent mode” sound. This uses the microphones from the noise cancelling feature to actually pass ambient sound through to your ears while you listen to music or the phone. It seems like such a small feature, but ultimately, the ability to walk around with full environmental awareness AND music or your phone is pretty awesome. It makes the music presence more like high quality background sound All the time. NOISE CANCELLATION
I put these in when I was on a plane alongside my Bose Noise Canceling headphones. The performance was comparable or possibly even slightly better because these seal your ear. Given the match in performance, I’d rather wear these because it’s easier to sleep. SOFT BUD TIPS
The soft bud tips aren’t magic, they just work the way all other bud manufacturers have been doing for years. “Oooh, but Apple made them white and...“ nope, just soft tips. Move along. CHARGING
Compared to the originals, these function the same. If you have OCD and use your earbuds all day long, you may find they need to go into the case sooner by half an hour or something ... but I’ve seen no real difference in regular “in/out/in/out” daily use. CASE
With a millimeter difference here or there, it’s the same size as the original case, rotated 90 degrees. IPHONE INTEGRATION
Same special proprietary features as the originals, but the icon looks like a pair of confused ducks. OVERALL
I wear them every day, leave them in when I’m not using them and consider them a key part of my work life for phone calls and music. Do they constitute a full upgrade to the originals? Not totally, but somewhat. The transparent sound is the main “wow” feature, and the noise cancellation is solid. If the loose feel of the originals bothered you, the new tips solve that. If you don’t care about the cost of buying new ones so soon after getting the originals, these are a worthwhile improvement on the originals and you’ll be happy. If I lost mine, I’d pay for another pair.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-24,Amazing! My favourite wireless earphones!,"Honestly, I was a little bit spectacle about purchasing this AirPods, because I know the original ones are just like the wired Apple earphones, where you can hear the sounds from outside and I did not want to spend 100$+ for earphones that can hear outside! Smh So I did my research diligently (for weeks). Finally decided to purchase the AirPods pros for my birthday especially because I love Apple and after my LG TONE Pro HBS-770 broke down within 10 months smh, never buying again. I am a huge audiophile and especially when it comes to picture and sound; I look for the best. I tested both LG and AirPod Pro and the Pros comes in first because it does block out any noise from the outside - I would say mostly 80%. I also hear that it adapts to the sound to actively block out any noise outside especially when I shop: I can’t hear my footsteps, the people around, the car on the streets. It’s amazing! Plus I can leave them in my ear and they are so comfortable, especially when I’m on the treadmill they stick like glue! Plus it helps with the sweat resistant feature the AirPods provide! Sometimes I forget they are in my ear lol also the transparency mode works well so I don’t have to remove my earphones (but seriously I’m listening to music why are you talking to me) lol
I also love switching between Noise cancellation and transparency modes. Golden. Even when the modes for Off, the sound is still particularly good. My recommendation is that if you are or not an audiophile and you want to purchase AirPods, go for the AirPod Pros. You won’t be disappointed. 249$ it can be high, but it’s money well spent. It’s better to spend a little more or a lot more to get what you want versus spending 100$ less and you aren’t satisfied.... life is too short! Enjoy while you can :D Plus 249$, I mean... we spent 249$ on anything else :P",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-25,ANC is awesome,"The active noise cancellation is in all honesty pretty amazing. There’s very little white noise when nothing’s playing and the ability to eliminate noise; especially steady state noise, is kinda mind blowing. I found a tip that’s comfortable for me, so I often forget they are in my ear. The only time I break the ear seal is when chewing. Transparency mode is convenient and almost must in some situations. These buds don’t get insanely loud, just loud enough. I find the sound quality is actually very good, a huge improvement over the AirPods.

I feel like I can hear delicate background parts of songs I've never heard before, especially when in Noise Cancellation mode. Bass is represented really well - you can make out the pitch as opposed to just a rumble. While Noise Cancellation mode does a decent job, I feel like there are products that can do better if that's your primary reason for buying. My only reservations are about the controls on the stem of the AirPod Pros and them staying in my ears - both of which weren't a problem with the regular AirPods. Since they're fairly expensive, I'm hoping they won't fall out - I might size up on the included ear buds so that they're extra snug or look for 3rd party options.

Otherwise, you might still hear sounds on the street. However, the transparency mode worked quite well and unique for me though I still can't distinguish what's the difference between turning on the transparency mode and using a bluetooth speaker. This mode allows you to listen both the music and the surrounding voices, so you'll be able to notice what's happening around you while your music is still played. Overall, this is a good apple product, but somehow, it receives too many compliments that I thought it's going to be a wonderful headphones. Well... I'm not really saying this is bad, but rather sharing some of my thoughts here. I hope my sharing would be beneficial to some of you :)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2019-12-29,Noise Cancellation is Amazing,"Let me start off by saying that I am SO happy that Apple went ahead and made the in hear design headphones. I tried & I tried to make the original AirPod's stay in my ear, but they would continue to fall out. The original AirPod's did just not fit my ears, and I know there are a lot of people out there that can agree. WELL, let me tell you, you don't have to worry about it with these headphones. These AirPods go in ear, and they come with multiple ear tips to make sure you get the right fit. You can even go into the settings for the headphones and there's a feature that will let you know if you have proper fitment with the ear-tips. When I personally used the feature, my ears worked fine with both Small ear-tips & Medium ear-tips. Large did not work on me. The noise cancellation is amazing on these as well. I use the for just about anything. I was at a party once, and someone sent me a video on my iPhone. Luckily I had these in my pocket and I was able to put them on, tune everything out due to the noise cancellation and listen to my video. It was all so buttery smooth. I didn't have to wait for them to pair or turn on. I literally just took them out of my pocket and inserted them in my ear and I was listening away. They also try to keep the size of the original AirPod's. The case is ever so slightly bigger, but it is not noticeable at all unless you put the old AirPods and new AirPods Pro together. They still easily fit in that little pocket in my jeans. All in all, I am super happy that these are out, and I take them with me everywhere daily. I don't leave my house without them. Definitely worth the price if you want an overall great pair of wireless headphones.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The sound quality is decent but not mind blowing for the price and the noise cancelling was great as well but when loud noise are around you, I noticed the earbuds to have a weird sound reaction to that so I didn't use it that much because of it. The active noise feature was the coolest thing about the earbuds. When this is turned on, you can still listen to whatever on the earbuds but it gives complete clarity to your ear for anything around you. For those that like to have your earbuds in all the time then this is the feature for you. Now to the issues I experienced and why I'm returning. My ears have always struggled with earbuds and fit and I felt that the rubber tips would be the game changer finally. I knew Apple was providing customers will multiple tips so that I could hopefully find something that worked for me. It comes with medium size on it and at first these seemed great but they continued to slip around so I thought maybe the smaller tips would help by going into my ear further. This was no success and the large were too big. I liked having them in but they continued to move around and I feared for them falling out and breaking on the pavement.

-Apple including a USB C to Lightning cable but no brick...rendering this cable worthless to me (If you have a 2018-2019 iPad Pro or 2016 or newer MacBook great) but cmon Apple... everyone else puts a charging brick in the box. Summary
-I saw a lot of reviews on these and had high expectations. However after a few days of use I'm very disappointed. As a musician who plays 7 instrument and has a home recording studio I can tell you mic angle/direction and proximity is huge for audio quality. In Airpods Gen 1 & 2 the mic in the stem angles the mic towards your mouth resulting in excellent phone call audio. The ""Pro"" version places the mic on the side angling away from your mouth loses this. Essentially Apple has traded voice call quality for Noise Cancellation....a good marketing ploy but bad decision for many users. If you are using these primarily for music you are good but for phone calls especially outside or in noisy settings these fail. Do not buy you will regret it. Stick to Airpods Gen 1 or 2
Also this product on Amazon fixed my main issue on the previous Gen Airpods allowing me to use them at the gym.

Sweaty at the gym, loved it...no slippage from my ears, great sound quality and noise cancellation was above average. Noisy restaurant during happy hour, solid performance, barely able to hear any external sounds with cancellation on. Flight to/from Orlando, impressed how little external noise I could hear. Not sure if its due to the tech or just finally have a pair that fit well in my ear...LOVE them. My only con is that you cannot control the volume from the pod itself; that has to be done from the phone.

As a student, these come in handy a lot when I'm in a public space and need to focus to study/read as the noise cancelation on these is pretty good to where people talking in the background is muffled enough and is then just white noise, even without any music playing. This was not the case when I had the regular Airpods. I really like the noise cancelation, but must admit it's my first time with this feature in a pair of headphones, as I've only really used Apple headphones for the last 5-8 years at this point. The sound quality is good, better than the regular ones, and overall I like their look and they don't feel uncomfortable in my ears. My biggest thing when comparing them to the regular Airpods however is that I can't talk or eat in them because after a little while the right headphone seems to ever so slowly slide out. This is not really an issue as I can just take out the right headphone while doing these things, but it was never an issue with the regular Airpods, and it is a bit of a ""sacrifice"". It's not a deal breaker and overall I really enjoy the experience of using them, but it's just something to consider (especially for the price tag). If you don't care too much for noise cancellation, and just want easy to use wireless headphones for your iPhone, I think you should save the money and get you some regular Airpods.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These are a game changer. Sound is beautiful. Noise cancellation is amazing - does not block it all out 100% but if you are listening at reasonable volume, you are in your own little world. Transparency mode lets you hear people talking to you and it's kinda crazy how well it works. I've read some reviews that say they are painful and for me that has not been the case in the slightest. There are 3 sizes of ear tips that come with them and you may have to play with them all to find the best seal and comfort - not hard to do and worth the minimal effort. I agree with the annoyance of having them come with an unusable cable and no cube. (The cable is for the new iPhone 11 cube and I have the 10 cube which will charge them just fine). Kind of a slap in the face, especially for the price...

These are soooooo much better than the cheap ones I originally ordered! Pros:
- Great noise cancellation
- Impressive sound quality
- Charging cable for AirPods is the same cable as the newer iPhones
- Maintains a long battery life
Cons:
- Pairing my phone to the AirPods can be tricky at times. Have not yet been able to master how to easily switch between car phone/Bluetooth to AirPods. Or how to switch from one AirPod bud in to using both buds during the same phone conversation. In time, I’m sure I’ll figure it out! - The AirPods come with 3 sets of ear cushions of varying sizes. However even when using the smallest option of ear cushion, it’s still too large for my ear. Because of the fit, these have fallen out of my ears a few times and I’m constantly having to push them back in. I am now looking to purchase additional ear cushions that will be a better fit for me

For some reason, the average, work-a-day, degenerate, trough-eating, deplorable, resistance/trump-voting norms don't seem to get that it isn't a magic potion that eliminates all the sound that you don't like at the moment. Teasing aside, all noise cancelation works by detecting sound with a normal, repetitive aural pattern, like an airplane engine or an air conditioner, a lawn mower, etc. It doesn't cancel all outside sound, like voices or other intermittent sound that doesn't conform to a regular, predictable pattern. Given that knowledge, I think these headphones do the best that is physically possible from an IEM headphone. Of course, over-the-ear headphones will insulate more outside sound, but for portable headphones these work in a close to optimal manner.

I received them and immediately set them up on my iPhone 11. I used them for a phone call that took about an hour and removed them afterwards. Here are my thoughts --
Sound Quality -- overall the sound quality was good but did notice a bit of echo. I didn't look into this very much but might have been due to the room I was in. I felt the sound quality was good and I am sure if I tinkered with the sound it would have been better. Comfort -- this was the deal breaker for me. The AirPods Pro come with three tips (small, medium and large). I tried all three for extended periods of time and they all caused my ears to hurt afterwards. Previously, I used the wired earbuds that come with the iPhone and have used them for extended periods of time and never had issues. Ultimately, this caused me to return these back to Amazon. Everyones comfort will be different so I would still encourage others to try them. Be aware that you may find the original AirPods (non Pro) to be more comfortable than the Pro version because of the silicone for noise cancellation. Personally, I found a cheaper set ($40) bluetooth headphones found on Amazon to be much more comfortable and be comparable in quality. I was also disappointed that Apple didn't even include a wall charger for these at $249.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-01-05,A great option with drawbacks,"This review is mostly geared towards active/athletic use, but for normal day use these AirPods are more than adequate. They have great dynamic range and clarity. The provided silicone attachments should cover most ear sizes. However, if different type/sizes are required they need to be specific to AirPods, because the connection and oval shape. For active/normal use, if you have already used the previous AirPod models, these are definitely a nice upgrade. They sound as if a subwoofer was added, which is great. But there are some specific drawbacks. First, when using silicone attachments there is a vacuum seal. If you are not used to having silicone attachments, this can take some getting used to, especially when running. There is a noticeable boom noise on your eardrums when your body is in motion, because of the vacuum seal. You have to crank up the volume to compensate. This may not work for some users. Second, the noise cancellation and transparency settings do not work as well when in motion, or if you have a hat on that covers the AirPods. The computer chip tries to compensate, but distorts the audio a bit to where clarity of sound is worse when they’re enabled. Probably because the chip has to work extra hard at dealing with constant external noise changes. Turning off the settings works much better for clarity in motion. For normal everyday use, the noise cancellation and transparency settings work quite well. I work in an office that uses white noise generators, and the noise cancellation setting blocks everything out. Transparency works good, but you still have to turn down the volume if you want to have a conversation with someone at the same time. So to summarize:
Pros:
1. Sound quality is much improved from previous models. Dynamic range is much greater. 2. Battery life appears to be better, especially when talking. 3. The pause/next/prev song clicking options are a nice feature. 4. Siri enabled control is a bonus. 5. Shorter tip design. 6. Wireless charging. 7. Bluetooth connection with iPhone is virtually flawless at way more than 33ft (more like 100ft), even in a busy gym environment, and pairs in seconds. 8. AirPods automatically connect to last known device when inserting them in ears. 9. Music/Audio will pause/resume automatically when pulling out from/putting back into ear. Cons:
1. Vacuum seal of silicone attachments causes eardrum booming noise when body in motion. 2. Noise cancellation and transparency settings distort audio when body in motion. 3.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-06,Fantastic sound quality and noise cancellation,"This headphones are probably the best sounding (overall sound) wireless in-ear headphones I've ever heard. The sound is crisp with great highs, mids, and yes, even lows. I've always been a BEATS fan for the heavier base, but this sound is better overall. I'm extremely impress with the ACN (Active Noise Cancellation). It works incredibly well, and the transparency mode is fantastic when you still want to be able to hear what's going on around you. With all that said, I do think there are a few cons. Not deal breakers, but areas that I think could make this device perfect:
1. Biggest complaint, there is no power adapter with the charging cable, and the charging cable is USB-C. Meaning you cannot plug the charging cable into the same plugin blocks you have for all your other USB charging devices. Yes, you can use any lightning cable to charge the case, but why include the new charging cable without a plugin adapter? 2. I do miss volume controls on the ear buds. You can pause, forward, go back, change ACN, and activate Siri with squeezing the earbuds, but you can't change the volume unless you physically do it on your connected phone, or you tell Siri to increase the volume. 3. You can reassign the squeeze on each ear bud for ACN or Siri, but the ACN setting must be the same on both. So for example you can't have the left turn on ACN or Transparency, and the left simply turn it off. They must both be the same. Or you can set one side to activate Siri instead of simply saying ""Hey Siri."" 4. The charging case as a light on it, green for fully charged, orange for depleted. But there's no indicator on the case it self for how charged it is. You can view the percentage on your phone, but I wish there were 4 or 5 small indicator lights on the case to tell you how charged it is, 25%, 50%, 75% etc. Similar to how the laptops have the battery indicator lights on the side. 5. Memory Foam tips would be incredible. Don't get me wrong, the silicone tips are fine, and the fit is great (I use the large), but coming from BEATS, Shure, and Bose in the past, I know how good the foam tips work for fit, and passive noise cancellation. Providing foam tips would me a great product even better! (DO NOT BUY any 3rd party foam tips, these tips are a property connection that is unique. I'm not familiar with any 3rd party brands that will fit perfectly at this point.) All that said - These are fantastic and I am very happy with my purchase. There's just a few things they could do to make these great headphones even better.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,0,2020-01-07,6 Reasons Why I Hate My AirPod Pros,"I honestly can’t see why people like these so much. I have a lot of apple stuff but I’m beginning to think it’s a cult. These are a significant step back from my 3-year-old Bose SoundSports. Here are 6 reasons I hate them:
Why I *HATE* my AirPod pros
1.) There is no volume control on the AirPods
2.) There is no way to toggle between multiple devices. You have to manually go into settings on your computer or phone to switch between the two. 3.) After being forced to take the case with you everywhere , if you lose the case you are SOL. You can’t buy a replacement charging case anywhere. Like it’s not possible. You have to set up a Genius Bar appointment to get a replacement case. 4.) Pressing the control buttons on the EarPod while running is pretty uncomfortable as it it’s hard to do it without yanking around the piece that’s inside your ear canal. 5.) They call it a “wireless charging case” but this means nothing if you don’t buy additional equipment. 6.) There is no way to charge the AirPods with what is just in the box. You *have* to have other Apple products or charging equipment. The box contains a lightning to usb-c cord, but no power block. I just threw it away since I had nothing to plug the usb-c side into. I ended up just using my iPhone lightning charger to plug into the case. Overall I’m shocked that people like this setup and it gets anywhere over a 6/10 on reviews. It’s nice how it pauses when you take one out of your ear, and I think they sound decent. But overall I found them to be a very mediocre product.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Options to customize the buds that work for my ears

Negatives:
The customize buds were a little hard to take off from Pros and I wonder how long they will hold up before ripping (if I want to switch them out again)
The smell from the pro case is pretty intense. I would say a chemical smell perhaps. I didn't notice this w the 2nd generation Pods

It uses your phone’s microphone and transfers it to the ear pods. I used them as ear plugs the other day when Using my leaf blower! I started with transparency mode on listening to music. I could definitely hear the music and absolutely the blower! When I turned transparency mode off, I was in a whole new world! It cut the outside sound by more than half.!

The hype is real! These are awesome headphones and you should buy them. Oh man I love these. I work in a yard truck which is an EXTREMELY loud environment and these drown out so much sound! It’s truly impressive. With noise cancelation on by itself I barely hear anything, add music to the mix and all I hear is the music. The transparency mode is really awesome too! If I’m listening to music or a podcast and someone needs to talk to me, I simply pause and flip transparency mode on and am able to hold a conversation almost like the pods aren’t even in my ear. my only complaint is I wash apple would make an app or complication on the watch to control these a little better. Volume controls works fine on Apple Watch but switching modes (transparency/Noise Cancellation) is hit or miss; mostly miss. Still, that is a failure of the watch, not the headphones and the headphones have controls on them which seem to work fine.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2020-01-09,Do better Apple.,"UPDATE: These are literally designed to have a short lifespan. There is no way to fully discharge the batteries from both the case and the pods as the pods do not work if the case is dead, although they work without the case if you had already started using them. This is to depreciate the lifespan on the product itself. With lithium ion batteries you need to fully discharge between charges for the best battery life. Seems like Apple has designed these in a manner where you actually can’t do so. Pathetic. I really didn’t have crazy expectations for these but they’ve let me down in every way. -Doesn’t even come with a power block to charge the device, because they make you buy it separately. -Sound quality doesn’t match the price tag as it’s very heavy on the bass and mid range but treble is almost non-existent. -Water exposure rating is extremely poor, which won’t be covered by Apple care if you get these wet or too sweaty and they stop working. -Battery life should be better for the price tag as these do not last as long as advertised. -The case is poorly designed as it’s extremely easy to accidentally push the cap backwards which will break it off. -These are designed to be inoperable if they need maintenance or are malfunctioning as the housing is glued together. If you open them up, you’d never be able to put them back together again. -Since these cannot be repaired, it contributes to our global pollution problem as once you’ve reached your max recharge amount and degraded the battery, there’s nothing to do but throw them away and get new ones. Apple really needs to do better. This is just another example of how badly they’ve let these products slip. -No way to locate the device if it gets lost. -No security functions to keep strangers from making it their own if they find it or steal it. -Have to get a case for the case because it scratches insanely easily. What’s the point of designing something to look sleek when you have to put a bulky case on it?",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Low frequency (bass) quality can be difficult to implement and for its size, it is really impressive. Meaning that I don't find anything lacking really. Battery life: Excellent. No problems so far. Noise cancellation: Very good. I can still hear some sound frequencies from the outside but it effectively drowns out jet engine noise on a plane for the most part, but not all voice frequencies, is what I have observed.

We have at our house some Beats Studio (noise canceling) and Bose QC (noise canceling) which are both 'slightly' better, but so much larger. The other thing thats so amazing about AirPods (I've owned both the original and AirPods Pro) is that you can clip them on your keychain or slip them in your pocket and you have great headphones and noise canceling with you all the time.

Apple will claim you will need to deal with Amazon, so after the back and forth, Apple will make you wait for parts and treat u differently because u purchase them not through Apple. A Nightmare for me. It took me 4 visits to the Apple Store, hours on the phone, and almost $75 of Transportation. After getting off the phone w Apple, who instructed me to go to the store and just swap the device that they had it in stock, I headed to the store right away:
First visit: They ordered new AirPods (only the AirPods parts without the case), I had to go back to pick them up after a few days. Second visit: Picked them up. Apple employee told me to go home and plug it in that it would work after 30 min. I did. No luck. Waited for a few hours plugged in, still no luck. Called Apple Support who told me the problem was in the case and sent me back to the store. Third visit: Went back to the Apple store and genius found out the AirPods had different Firmware from each other. Told me it would take awhile for the AirPods to look at each other and update themselves. Also they got me a new case (luckily in stock). The agent told me I had to wait 30 minutes plugged in there that it would work with the new case. It didn’t. However, they would not go any further with me unless I waited longer plugged in which I couldn’t. They sent me home and said it would work in a few hours. Of course it didn’t. Left it plugged in overnight, no luck in the morning. Fourth visit: Back to the store in the morning. I was at this point beyond frustrated and since the very beginning, I asked them to simply swap the defective product w new AirPods since mine were less than a month old. They said they would not. At this moment, finally someone bright, one of the managers, noticed the situation and saw there was nothing they could do about it, Since all parts were already swapped and decided to do the obvious thing and give me a new product. This was the worse experience I have ever had. I can try to prove to you that up to this day, I might have given Apple somewhere in the vicinity of almost 100k thinking better.

However, I quickly learned that the main body of the Airpods Pro made them rather uncomfortable. The problem I had was that the inner structure of my ear was too small for the body, and thus it would dig into my ear. While this problem may not apply to you, it was a dealbreaker for me.

I guess sweat got into it or light rain got into but I had to sell those because they started to mess up on me..Apple doesn’t say they are sweat proof or any IP rating so I guess that’s my fault. The fit was perfect they never feel off and I loved them. Now I’ve tried a lot of different types but they would all fall off true wireless ones. I said the hell wit them and I went for air pods pro because of familiarity and IP rating. Pros:
Secure fit (didn’t fall off my ears while running). Sweat proof. Noise cancellation (didn’t hear cars next to me). Phone calls. Lightweight. Shorter stem. transparency mode. Replaceable silicone tips. Cons:
This is more my problem my left ear felt “heavier” Not a perfect fit but for some reason my right ear was perfect. Battery. Could be better. Earbud is bigger than airpods 2.

So now that I have time with them, they are simply that much better all around. They stay in place during any activity--- workouts, eating, talking, etc....and all without any bad pressure points or excessive pressure on your ear. Sound quality is very good and I often use them one at a time. With that said....
The first time I put them both in and have it set to noise cancelling....WOW. walking the dog in 20mph winds....no problem for me to hear as all background noise is negligible and the equally awesome part is with all 4 mics active.....the caller hears only your voice. Siri works well and I am still exploring what can be done with voice commands. At first I was going to keep my others....they are now up for sale. These are just that much better to use. Original post
So yes, we all know they are expensive. I have tried and had well over 30 different types of headphones, ear buds, both Bluetooth and wired... For me I like to use a single earbud for phonecalls--- just been my preference whether at the office or walking the dog. Needless to say my last single earbud decided to die and I was left with looking for a replacement. I did try a couple of others and although sound quality was good and noise cancellation was also much better than in the past, fitment was a huge issue. So for the AirPod Pro I have to say that I have already worn them well over a dozen hours since I received them a couple days ago. Fit is very good. I can talk, chew gum, eat food--- and they stay in and feel like they're going to stay in. Others I have tried will fall out the more I move my jaw. Maybe it is just me, but in this case it has to be about me. I do use them in transparent mode, which is slick--- allows you to hear what is around you and if you have both in, you can pause your music and don't have to pull one out to hear someone talk to you. Another great feature is that they allow your ears to balance properly with atmospheric pressure. All others that I have had caused pressure in my ears at some point or another. These allow them to equalize and simply is one of the many great features. So beyond that, sound reproduction is good. Make that really good for such a small device. Add in the fact you can use Siri without a button is also a huge plus. Talking to people and noise cancellation is so far--- excellent. Pairing was as simple as having my phone in one hand, the AirPods in their case in the other and opening the top of the case...done in 10-seconds. Overall I will use them quite a bit, but I still have my wired Bose and a set of wireless Beats that I still rely on. The biggest issues with the Bose and Beats is they are geared towards playing music, etc...not talking unless you're in a quite room. Maybe they will all go on the wayside once I use these more....but so far, I am happy.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

As a carpet cleaner these were exactly what I was looking for: the noise cancelling drastically reduces the sound of the machines I work with while allowing me to listen to music or podcasts at a reasonable level (I haven’t found any ANC headphones that actually cut out the vacuum noise completely), there aren’t any cords to get caught on my machinery which would happen frequently when using EarPods, and they have a snug enough fit that the AirPods don’t fall out on their own while I’m working. There have been a few times where they have gotten sprayed indirectly with water and I have unintentionally dropped them in a puddle and had no issues with sound quality or functionality. I just made sure they were dry before I stuck them back in the charging case and had no I’ll effects at all. The battery life is fantastic and I’ve never run out of battery even on long 4+ hour jobs while using ANC the whole time. Plus the fast charge in the case helps provide enough playback time even when it’s just a short drive to the next job. Switching between ANC and transparency mode is incredibly easy for when I need to talk to a customer in the middle of a job, and often times I’ve found myself wearing them into stores if I’m shopping alone. I’m still able to listen to podcasts while hearing other shoppers around me, and Transparency mode makes it seem as if I’m not wearing the AirPods when me media is paused because it’s seamlessly using the exterior microphones to help me hear my surroundings. At home I love how easy it is to switch between my iPhone, MacBook, and Apple TV. Using the playback from the tv allows me to watch shows or movies even after my housemate goes to bed without waking her which is very helpful. On Apple TV you can just hold the play/pause button on the Siri Remote and a menu will pop up allowing you to select your AirPods as the audi

These are the best of the 5 different pairs of high-end earbuds I own. However, to make them work for my ears, I upgraded the ear tips to foam. The included silicone tips kept falling our of my ears, and I tried all 3 sizes. On Saturday the left ear fell out 3x on my 2 mile walk. So - I found an upgrade offered by an eBay seller that includes foam tips with a clip that replaces the apple silicone tips. The foam works like a charm. Not only do they fit great in my ears, they don't fall out , and fit easily in the original charging case. The bass and highs are now both cleaner and crisper.. Apple should revisit using foam similar to the comply tips. I'm writing this review after my walk today because the AirPod pros are absolutely sensational with this foam tip upgrade. I predict, that all the haters would change their minds, if they had a chance to try this for themselves. Other features I like: noise reduction works great, the touch sensitive switches on the earpieces also work perfectly. Charging is quick, and switching between an iPhone and MacBook pro is seamless. The sheer convience of these AirPod pros is reason enough to use them any Apple products. Apple designers should be proud of this product. I love tech, and these earbuds are the best of the bunch.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-13,As good as it gets from Apple,"I am surprised I am writing this. I had given up on Apple innovating and creating a NEW great product years ago*( the watch is a bomb if you ask me) .Example, I still use an Iphone, a 5 year old well maintained 5SE, (I hate their models of the last 5 years, they are hugggge). Anyway, I use ear buds daily at work, 5-6 hours a day, every day. I have at least 8 pair, 5-6 wired 4-5 non wired and spent some serious money on a few, my best wired pair are a high end set of Shures, my wireless, Bose, Jaybirds, Jabra etc.
I am always and have been looking for that sweet spot; great sound, they actually stay in your ears , seamless phone inter-activity , noise cancelling . I listen to a wide range of music; ambient, rock, classical etc…
The first model airpods were crud, they didn’t stay in your ears, the sound was just ok to good etc. I had borrowed a pair for a week, that was my take. I borrowed a pair of the new airpod pros, and, its like going from a roman candle to a moonshot from the original model to this second generation. The Pros sound better than my jabras, jaybirds by a mile , do they sound like my wired Shures? No, of course not. But they are darn good. The case is well made and charges your pods very quickly. The pods have excellent phone interaction , best I have ever used. The noise cancellation (and fit kit) is a huge Wow, imho the original Airpod model had zero noise can cancellation. I gotta say they shocked me, the pros are a very very good set of earbuds.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I tried a smaller company that was known for their audio quality the first time around, with roughly the same type of tap buttons on the ears as the airpods. The bluetooth however was absolutely terrible. I ended up returning them and getting a pair of the powerbeats3's for the w1 chip. The bluetooth now was perfect, however the sound quality was absolute garbage and they still had the wire between the ears, which caught on my neck like it was covered in glue. I kept them for the gym, but they still couldn't replace my old wired set I was using to commute and at work. The airpods on paper looked like they could be the ones and I got a pair at the beginning of November. Given what I had dealt with from the prior pairs, they were exactly what I expected when they arrived. The sound quality is fairly average, but given the rest of the features and the solid connectivity of the w1, I could live with it. However, it's been 3 months now and I am starting to see build quality issues. The left one started rattling a couple weeks ago like something was loose. I googled it and it looks like this issue wasn't just me in isolation. Apple was easy to work with. They switched out the left earpod only though, and shortly after the right ear also started to rattle. I would expect better quality. The problem may only hit 1/10 or 1/20 pairs, but given the price point of these I would expect better. I'll update in another 3 or 4 months with the new pair and see if maybe the ones I had were part of a bad batch.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The active noise cancelling does give me a headache when no sound is being played, so I have to either keep music playing or take them off between conference calls. Not much of an issue for me, just something to keep in mind. The fit of the earbuds is comfortable, and the stem has been designed to be shorter than the Airpods, which I personally think is an improvement.

My only complaint with those, really, was that in some situations, like lifting weights, they weren't as secure in my ears as I would like. Also, I couldn't do things like mow the lawn while listening to music with them because they don't really try to block outside noise. So I was really looking forward to these new ones to solve those problems. Boy, do they, and how. Not only are they perfectly snug and form a nice seal in my ears, the noise cancellation, but ability to easily switch to transparent mode, is just amazing - far beyond what I expected. Then on top of all of that, my music just sounds incredible. I'm a bit hard-of-hearing with some good tinnitus, so I don't have really high expectations when it comes to playback quality, but I'm just blown away by how good music sounds with these. I'm hearing little things in my music that I've never heard before. Another game changer here.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-15,Apple vs Sony,"Both the Apple Airpods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds had very good reviews so I decided to purchase both and see which one worked for me. Sound:
I have been in audio engineering for 40 years but honestly sound is a very personal thing. Some people like heavy bass while I prefer a genuine full spectrum experience, as if I were sitting in front of a live orchestra. That said, I suspect the Sony earbuds will make the bass aficionado very happy. In my opinion they lacked a full range experience while the Apple was very refreshing making every instrument stand out, even the softest notes. Both had good quality as far as NO distortion even at max volume. Speaking of volume, the Sony could not achieve the same loudness as the Apple. (I should also point out that I was using an Apple iPad Pro as my source device, not that it ""would or should"" make a difference) The Apple also had better clarity most likely because the Sony bass drowns everything else out making it sound a bit muddy. Comfort:
In my opinion the Apple wins this one hands down. The Sony is much heavier and seems to run a bit hot as my ears literally burn when I use them. I can't imagine trying to listen long term with the Sony while the Apple earbuds feel very comfortable for the long haul. They both have different size buds that can be interchanged very easily. The Sony has more options and even has two different materials that might appeal to someone who has skin allergy. The down side of the Apple might be that because they are so light it might be easier to loose them however if one the Apple buds fall out, the sound comes to a halt on both which is very nice. Another thing to point out for the athletic type is that the Apple is sweat resistant where the Sony is not. Function and Control:
I hate to keep harping on the Sony but once again it mostly fails in this category. One thing the Sony has that I truly like is the ability to pass through external sounds by simply touching and holding the left bud. This also pauses what you are listening to while you attend to the interruption. Once you release your finger it resumes your music or whatever you are listening to. Unfortunately the Sony tap (touch) control for pausing, advancing and changing sound modes are hit or miss at best. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't making for a very frustrating experience. The Apple has a little microswitch on each bud that consistently works as advertised. Either left or right bud of the Apple perform the same function while the left and right buds of the Sony have unique functions. The Apple has a seal test that you can run in the app settings to help you get a good fit. UPDATE: After loading the latest firmware the controls are much better for the Sony. No other improvements noted. Carrying Case:
On both of these the case function as an integral part of the system. They both have internal batteries that charge the buds while the buds are in the case. The Apple case is a bit smaller and lighter making it the better choice for my pocket. The Apple can also be charged wirelessly or by USB cable where the Sony must use a cable only. The Sony is more stylish and feels more expensive. I haven't yet tested battery run time but from what I've read, they are both similar. Summary:
Overall the Apple is my pick and makes me very happy. I'm sure there are many more options one might consider concerning either of these brands but this is just my experience in a nutshell and I hope it is helpful.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

First, the fit is terrible. I have never been able to use any headphones from apple -- neither wired nor the pods. They just don't stay in my ears. These latest pods are no different. The silicone tips are too short to catch on my earholes for a good fit. Because of the fit, they don't seal well and so ANC works at well at all. That said ANC isn't that great even if I could get a good fit (if I push them into my ears and hold them there, I do get a good fit). I've got Sennheiser PCX-550-II phones with ANC and the noise reduction is far superior. I also have B&O E8s and their passive noise reduction is superior too. The ANC provided by these buds is better than nothing. If you want good ANC, go with another brand. All in all, for $250, I would expect a better fit and function.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I find the regular Apple EarPods to be incredibly uncomfortable and was unfortunately not surprised when the AirPods were also uncomfortable. I returned them after wearing them for less than an hour. Then...Apple made my wireless headphone dreams come true! I held out for awhile on these due to the price. But with a return of a Christmas gift for a gift card, my out of pocket cost was much more reasonable. I’ve only had these for about 24 hours but I am loving them so far. The small adapters fit well in my ear, though sometimes the right one randomly starts to migrate, which may be related to my Travis piercing in that ear. I bought these more for work and travel and not really for exercise, so I haven’t tried them yet working out. The noise cancellation and transparency options seem to work really well and I also like that you can do a fit test. I’ve had no issues with connectivity so far. I did buy a silicone case with a carabiner to protect them and help prevent me from losing them. The case is sturdy and the AirPods seem secure inside. I like the squeeze controls much better than the tapping on the 2nd gen AirPods I tried before. I never seemed to be able to tap in the right spot and the squeeze with the audible click as feedback is so much easier! I still think they look a bit ridiculous in the ear, but I think all true wireless buds do, so it’s not a big issue for me.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2020-01-18,"Only one ear bud works, customer service was not helpful","I was very excited for these headphones to come in, as I leave for a long trip in two days. Many of my friends have airpods and they are highly recommended by them. The shipping was quick and I received the airpods soon after I placed my order. After opening the airpods and pairing them to my device, I tested the audio quality by listening to a song. Less than a minute into the song, the right AirPod stopped playing music. I couldn’t get it to turn back on unless I unpaired them from my iPhone, repaired them, and went through the setup process. I did this three times; after a minute of listening to a song, the right AirPod would malfunction. I reached out to customer service to request a replacement but they said they were unable to provide me with one. So, I requested a refund and then I kept being transferred from one customer service representative to another. No joke. I spoke with Prasanna, Sanjay, Lavanya, Rahul, Amit Kumar, Agalya, Naina, Umesh, Aakash, Alex, & Pablo. Each of our conversations consisted of me re-telling them my situation and them saying “Let me transfer you to someone who can better assist you”. This went on for over two and a half hours. Finally I was put on the phone with a lady (I think her name was Katie) who said she could not process my refund unless I returned the item. This posed a problem because I had purchased insurance through Apple (Apple Care +) and wanted to have Apple fix the airpods after I received my refund for the faulty item, since I was not able to be given a replacement. IMO, it seems wrong for Amazon to sell Apple’s insurance plan if Amazon is just going to take the item back, not give me a replacement, or not let me send the airpods to Apple to be fixed (which is what the insurance is for).",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple earbuds fall out of my ears easily so I was worried I’d lose them. Then the pro was released and the fit looked really enticing. I finally took the plunge and I am so in love. I’m constantly listening to audiobooks and podcasts so I have a pod in one of my ears almost all the time. The easy of switching between each ear and never having to worry about battery life is wonderful. I can wear 1 pod in an ear for almost a whole day and not have to charge it. The case holds a long charge as well. They switch easily between my iPhone, watch, and iPad. I’ve even started using them with the Apple TV at night when watching movies after my husband falls asleep. The sound quality is excellent. I rarely turn on the transparency or noise canceling because they work great as they are, but they do a great job in any mode. The noise cancellation is very effective to drown out my husband and 7 years old when I’m trying to relax with an audiobook. I cannot say enough good things about these.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,0,2020-01-22,Use them for sleeping!,"I purchased these the day they came out. I had used the LG Tone pros for years (around the neck) but decided to give these a try. I liked the idea of the original Air Pod but hated the hard plastic buds. I returned them a day after buying them because I couldn’t get a good fit. I don’t have abnormally large ear canals but they were just uncomfortable. To me, $250 for poor fitment was unacceptable. The snap on design of the bud meant aftermarket tips were unlikely. But I absolutely loved them other than that. The noise cancelling is as good if not better than my Bose QC35s and the bass is the best I’ve found in an ear bud. The controls are a little finicky just because these are shorter than the original air pod. They pair instantly to the iPhone with little effort. The sound is amazing and the transparency mode makes it feel like you’re not even wearing them! In “off” they block out a lot of background noise but you need a good seal for the noise cancelling to work well. Ultimately I ended up buying them again because of the sound quality. Battery life was a concern for me. Off brand ear buds offer much better battery life but they’re bulkier. The battery life is decent on these. I tend to pop them in and remove them when not in use so they’re always getting a good charge in the case. I actually use them for sleeping. I have a hard time getting to sleep and hear everything around me. I purchased the Bose Sleep buds a few months back but they were uncomfortable for a side sleeper (plus they were recalled). These are so small I can’t even feel them in my ear when laying down. I turn on noise cancelling and play a white noise soundtrack such as Airplane Cabin noise or a outdoor sound. I usually wake up to find them somewhere in my bed (thank god for gps tracking). The price tag is definitely steep but all Apple products suffer from that. But they’re worth the price for the quality. I ended up playing with all the silicone tips before I found one that fit right. Although all 3 tips passed the “ear fitment test” according to my phone. There are memory foam tips available on other sites. As with any silicone tipped ear bud, as you sweat, they tend to loosen up. But I have not had them fall out.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I am very disappointed in the AirPods Pro. While sound is good, it seems that is only thing Apple focused and tested. Here's what I've discovered over the past few months of daily use:
* The noise cancellation is okay -- it certainly helps. But it causes ear pain due to a very high pitch when not when there is not audio playing through, and it certainly doesn't silence the outside environment completely. * I have AirPods too. I never had people tell me when using my AirPods they could not hear me. With the AirPods Pro, I would say more than half of the calls, people cannot hear me clearly. The microphone seems to be garbage -- people say I sound like I am underwater. * Often, I'll start a call on my iPhone X without using the AirPods Pro. If the conversation needs to become private, I'll then put them in my ears. The time it takes for the iPhone to transfer the call is long -- long enough that the person on the other end cannot hear anything, even background noise, thinks they lost me, and then hangs up. During this time, I do not hear anything either. It is frustrating. I'm going to go back to the original AirPods, and I will buy Bose QC20 which I had years ago that worked great.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-26,These are nothing short of incredible.,"Oh my goodness. These are incredible. 1) Background & Comparison:
I have had the Bose QC35 headphones for a year, and just purchased the Bose SoundSport Free (after purchasing the AirPods Pro) and love them both, but these AirPods Pro buds are SO lightweight I actually forgot I had left one in my ear at work the other day (no music playing of course). I don’t see a need for wearing my QC35s anymore because they’re heavy and large. After I purchased the AirPods Pro, purchased a pair of Bluetooth Bose Soundsport Free to compare sound and bass. Sound quality is great on the SoundSport Free model but I have issues with the size (even smalls tips hurt my ears) and they are bulky. Sorry, Bose, I really wanted to love your product but the AirPods Pro win for me due to size, ease of use, and comfort. ——
2) Fit:
My ears hurt with a lot of earbuds styles bc I have smaller ears, but the medium sized tips surprisingly fit great. There’s functionality to test the ear tip fit while you have them in your ear - I assume it tests pressure and seal that the tips make in your ear canal. They also don’t fall out and seem completely snug. I did work out in them, but haven’t run or done any kind of strenuous activity with them, but would be interested to see if they stay in while running. So far, I would assume they do based on the secure fit. ——
3) Noise cancellation & transparency mode:
I work in an open office and was completely shocked by the noise cancellation mode. It is AWESOME and really muffled out most (95%?) of the noise. I might wear these at work without playing music just so it’s quiet and I can focus better. Transparency mode is excellent for doing things around the house or wearing on a trail where I need to be cognizant of surroundings, and still want to hear my music. ——
4) Audio quality:
I feel like I don’t need to turn these up as loud as I have had to with other brands. Ear tip fit is great and sound is crystal clear. I wish they had more bass, but I do find the bass quite sufficient. I generally seek out bass in my headphones because of personal preference, and I’m happy with them. I do wish there was an equalizer to be able to adjust the settings for the use, but I’ll leave that to my music apps to do. Sound quality is great and I hope it will save my ears a little bit from not having to turn them up like I have had to with my other earbuds previously. ——

These are amazing. Form and function are great, and most of all, they are lightweight and ease of use is excellent.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-01-27,Worth it - but less than stellar ANC due to the last few firmware updates,"I purchased these as an upgrade to my 2nd Gen AirPods because the AirPod Pros seemed to solve all my pain points regarding the regular AirPods. They actually cancelled environmental noise (a must for me as I commute through a loud busy city and subway system every day), and the silicone tips mean they actually stay in my ears. They work as advertised. However, due to Apple releasing a shoddy firmware update, they don't cancel noise nearly as well as when I first purchased them. Apple pulled the firmware update I have a few days after release, but those with the latest update have no way to revert back to prior versions. Therefore: I'm stuck (as is everyone else who got the update) with so-so ANC until they release another firmware. However, they do still have SOME ANC abilities, just not as good. Pros:
- As with the regular AirPods, if you're already a part of the Apple ecosystem, they're a dream to pair and switching between devices is simple. - Call quality is excellent. For me, I take a lot of work calls through my phone and computer (Webex, Google Meet) and call quality is always fantastic
- Fits and stays in ears - I'm one of the ones who's a huge fan of silicone tips and for me, the APPs stay in my ears far better than the regular AirPods
- Decent -> Outstanding ANC depending on firmware version. I take BART daily and it is incredibly loud - between the noise of the train on the tracks, the fact that it's jam-packed with people during rush hour, and the subway car performers that bring their own speakers into the train car, it is LOUD. With the regular AirPods, I would have the volume cranked to max volume and still not be able to hear my music/podcast. When I first got the APP, with ANC on I could have my music at 50% volume and still hear. Now with the latest firmware that crippled the effectiveness of the ANC I need to crank the volume to 75-80% in order to still hear my music over the din. But, still, compared to the regular AirPods, it's no contest. I just wish the ANC performed as well as when I first bought the devices. Cons:
- No way to adjust the ANC level
- The fact that you can't revert to an older firmware version or choose if/when you update firmware, that means if Apple releases a bad update, you might get it and be stuck with it
- Silicone tips fit my ears better and are comfortable, but not sure I could wear them all day
- Battery level - my experience is that it's pretty close to 4.5 hours on a charge for the ear buds themselves, but I wish that was longer. I have the same complaint about the regular AirPods but I know that the technology isn't there yet for longer battery life. Mostly it just means these can't serve as my primary ANC headphones on longer flights. Which is a shame because I'd love to not have to bring my much larger over the ear ANC headphones on trips.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US
Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-01-27,"If you can manage the price, these things are INCREDIBLE","Love everything they bring to the table. If you use the right size ear tips they will fit snug. I run on weekends and they never fall out. The audio quality is crazy good. Not audiophile good, but not too shabby. The bass is deep and present. The dynamic audio between the two buds creates an insane depth of illusion where I sometimes truly cannot tell if the music I’m listening to is from the AirPod Pros or something around me. They can get quite loud, and if you have noise cancellation on you can get really loud without ever going over half volume (it’s harder to “hear” the volume when ambient environment noises conflict, thus requiring you to turn your volume up louder without noise cancellation)
The noise cancellation if you’ve never experienced it before is startlingly good. If you have experienced noise canceling before, it’s startlingly good! I commute via public bus daily and usually sit next to the engine in the back. The AirPods pros can’t manage to mask the engine’s entire hum purely by noise cancellation, but if you have music playing you will forget the engine is even there. The battery for most people will not be an issue given that you put them in the case intermittently. Now I use the AirPod pros mainly with new apple products but also have used them with android. Simply put, the connectivity is much more fluid with an apple product. The H1 chip and Bluetooth v5 on the AirPods and device make for a much better experience than I anticipated. The only issue I have is that when taking one AirPod out (this is supposed to stop audio) it will stop but then flicker the audio between on and off. This isn’t really a big con but just to say that the connectivity is not flawless. The price is the only real con here, but if you want in-ear true wireless noise canceling buds then there’s little to compete with these in the market. Samsung does have a noteworthy rival, though their connectivity is not as convenient as the AirPod Pros (especially for apple users).",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The AirPods pros are sleek and lightweight. I still find myself having to readjust them and they have fallen out but not as much as the Bose. Pros:
Sleek in ear and the case has a small footprint. Siri reads my text to me and I can respond via speech to text. The translucent feature is pretty cool, allow you to hear background noise, which I prefer when in public. Noise canceling is legit. Completely locks out sound, which I don’t like in public. Auto pulse when removed from the ear. Cons:
Does not announce the callers name or number for incoming calls. Bose free wireless did. AirPods forces you to blindly answer or pull out your phone or smart watch. Auto switch: they don’t always seamlessly switch from car audio to AirPods.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-01-28,What in gods name is the big deal,"I own both the 1st gen airpods and now the airpods pro. This is a temporary state, as I'm going to return the airpods pro this week. Everyone is losing their minds over these expensive little things, but there a few notable reasons why I don't think it makes sense to drop this much money for such a little upgrade over the 1st or 2nd gen airpods. * Regarding noise cancellation, the active noise cancelling leaves a few things to be desired. First, the new silicon seal alone keeps out noise much better than the hard plastic of the standard airpods--rendering the active noise cancellation kind of unnecessary and overkill. This alone isn't a functionality complaint; it just means the active noise cancellation is an expensive add-on. * Second, the noise cancellation only works when both airpods are in your ears. I typically wear one airpod at a time, and I really wanted noise cancellation to reduce the ambient noise in that ear alone. I understand this might sound foolish or like it defeats the purpose of noise cancellation, but those are my needs. And I bet many others have the same expectations. * The active noise cancellation creates uncomfortable pressure in my ears. Not a nuisance for a minute or two, but not something I want for the duration of a call or flight. I also understand this is not specific to Apple's tech, per se--lots of active noise cancellation technology does this. But this is a brand new, premium headphone--if the noise cancellation is uncomfortable, it's another reason to not use it and not pay for it. * Ear feel--this is a mixed bag. The fit is much more snug which means the airpods are much less likely to fall out and they block more noise passively. Great! However, it also means I'm much more aware of the bulb of the headphones in my ears--I can feel them all the time, as opposed to the 1st gen airpods which are better at 'disappearing'. For all of those reasons, I'm sending them back. I hope everyone else loves theirs without qualification! But you may want to test them out in a store before dropping the money, just to make sure.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

However, you have to realize it’s a crap shoot whether they will fit your ears properly.

This is a result of the stem being to short to properly seat in the ear canal. There is no way I can wear these things while conducting any physical activity. Even walking around the block will require me pushing them back into my ear several times. So basically, I’m restricted to using them while sitting still on the couch.

Typically Apple has a decent product and I'm an Apple portable devices user. These fall short. First and foremost, the Airpods Pro do not justify the cost. With technology at the level that it is today, I expect much better sound and much better noise-cancelling in this price range. My wired Bose earbuds blow these away and cost far less. Yes you have the wire, but everything from the sound to noise-cancelling is better. Last, I bought my first Airpods Pro pair in December. On a recent flight the right earbud died. Just died. After a long call with Apple, they suggested I take them to an Apple store for evaluation. Thanks, but no thanks. Amazon replaced them for me and the new pair arrived right away. Not sure I love them enough to keep them, however, the wireless feature including some noise-cancelling is a step in the right direction. We'll see. The price should be a major concern for you that love good sound and want better noise-cancelling. I can't compare them to anything else other than my wired Bose earbuds.

1) connecting to your iPhone never get easier than this AirPods. just open the case and pull the earphone out and voila~! the pic of the AirPods is on your iPhone screen. 2) I love the picture battery display, open the case and put next to your phone and battery status both case and AirPods pop up on your iPhone. 3) These buds fit my ears so well (love that they provide s few different sizes). my wife has small ears and usually, all headphone is just too big for her but these AirPods are perfect for her and me. 4) noise cancellation mode & transparency mode:
The noise cancellation on these AirPods is unbelievably good. filter out all those backgrounds noise so you can concentrate on your phone conversation/movie/news. The transparent mode is something new to me. In this mode, even the AirPods are nicely sealed around my ears I can still hear all my surroundings and have a normal conversation with my AirPods on. Sometimes I am scared that I am talking too loud on a phone conversation so I turn on this transparent mode where I can hear my own voice. and if the background noise is too loud I just turn on the noise cancellation mode. you can turn this function on and off based on your own preference. 5) Sound and quality are solid as well and the Bluetooth connection works great. Great sound quality. Although I need to adjust my volume over 50% most of the time. 6)The battery life on these are great as well. Nothing is more annoying when watching a movie and having your battery die during your commute. when you don't just pop it back to the case and you have fully charge AirPods every time you want to use it. 7) You can locate these Airpods through the ""Find my iPhone"" app and play a sound on it if you can find it. The price is not cheap. but you get what you pay for.

As a student, long study sessions with active noise cancellation (ANC) is important to me:
ANC makes my head hurt. When using them for a period of longer than 20 minutes, they make my head feel ""full"" and I can only describe it as a pressure sensation. If you are buying these purely for the noise cancellation, look more into over-the ear headphones. The transient noise cancellation from the ""off"" feature (between ANC and ""transparency mode"") is usually enough to block out most of the sound in a quieter library, but in a collaborative facility/office space, it may be less useful. In short, the headphones sound AMAZING. My ears are pretty normal, so for those whom in-ear headphones have worked in the past, I would highly recommend them as a high-quality listening tool. The only drawback I have found is the ANC making my head hurt. Suitable for short bus rides or walking by loud construction, but not good enough for long coffee shop study sessions.

First time around I put them in the wrong ears. Noise canceling is impressive and comfort is exceptional as I often feel pain in my ears after extended use of other ear buds.

I've been very please with them so I immediately wanted to upgrade to the Pros because they would be better, right? Well, that requires a nuanced response. The are nice in some key ways. Snappier connection, shorter ear stems, better control function, and better sound. I do like the noise cancelation, although I question how much is active noise cancelation versus just stocking silicone plugs in my ears. The transparency mode is basically just picking up the surrounding noise with a mic and playing it into your ear, but a bit louder than it would be without the buds. This makes it seem amazing when you activate noise cancelation and the sound goes dead, but I wish transparency mode didn't amplify the environmental sounds, just play them back at a normal level. My main problem with these is they just don't stay in my ears. The regular AirPods I've had for two years with zero problem of them falling out - no matter the activity, sports, running, gym, eating, sleeping, movies...whatever. The Pros are constantly falling out of my ears. I've tried the various ear tips and they all are bad. If I turn my head to eat a sandwich, out they go. Forget about running and sports. These things don't stay in my ears. That is a problem. That is where they belong. Trouble is I already gave my old ones to my wife and she loves them. Maybe, I can return these, since I've had them less than a month, and get the latest version of the regular AirPods, plus a refund of the difference.

Immediately, she started having problems connecting one airpod. The other side seemed to work ok. She continued trying to use them, but some days one airpod or the other would be dead (like it wasn't connecting to charge). By the end of January, she took a trip to Atlanta and they were basically unusable - showed connected, but couldn't hear or be heard. The other airpod side died after about 9 minutes, so basically L and R airpods were defective. Would be on the charger all night- one would charge and the other one would not. Tried to return them to Amazon and they said that the return time had expired even though it was a gift wouldn't return them, even though she had only used them for about 30 days. Missed the window by two days.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,0,2020-02-03,NOT WORTH IT! Please read this,"Let me preface by saying that I am a loyal apple customer. I have completely bought in to the elegant, easy to use, convenient, outrageously priced, company that is Apple. I have the latest Apple Watch, MacBook Pro, iPad, Apple pencil, and iPhone. And I am here to tell you that the AirPods pro are NOT WORTH IT! I'll start with the good: These headphones have very good noise cancelling. It baffles me how Apple was able to produce such great noise cancelling technology in an in-ear headphone. They also have transparency mode which is almost better than not wearing any headphones at all. You can hear yourself and your surroundings clear as day and all it takes to switch between the two is holding the stem for 2 seconds. The sound quality is also great. At least, when the headphone actually stays in your ear. Theres good balance and you feel completely immersed in the music. I also like the new system for pausing/unpausing sound. It is more assuring to hear a button click than praying that you tapped in the right spot on the right bud (which is what the original AirPods required). However despite the great engineering that went into these headphones, I do not recommend buying them! When I first fitted them in my ear they felt snug and the ear fitting gauge said the medium ones were perfect. Since then, I don't know if my ears have somehow stretched or what happened but the AirPods now fall out ALL THE TIME. I do wear them for long periods of time and they are usually comfortable for the first 30 minutes, but then my inner ear flaps start aching in pain. They have fallen out multiple times while I'm sitting at my desk not moving, and don't even get me started on what its like to exercise in them (lets just say as soon as there is any sweat it's game over). I know you're probably thinking ""Why don't you just put a bigger earpiece on?"" Nope. I will never do that again. If the pain from the medium earpiece is annoying, the bigger earpiece is unbearable. Not only are they uncomfortable, but they also die way faster than the original air-pods! This is probably due to the fact that I use them in noise canceling or transparency mode exclusively, but let me explain. I bought the AirPods Pro because I wanted portable noise-canceling headphones. If I was okay with non-noise cancelling, then I would have just stuck witch my original AirPods and saved $250+! I can usually wear these for 3.5-4 hours before they die whereas my original AirPods would last 7 hours easily. While the noise canceling is amazing, my original AirPods (and even regular headphones) do fine job of blocking out external noise when the music is lout enough. i would choose comfortable headphone that get the job done over super uncomfortable ones with real noise canceling. I also think there are much more comfortable noise canceling headphones on the market such as Beats and Bose over ear headphones. Unfortunately, I gave my original AirPods to a friend and dislike these AirPods Pro so much that I have reverted to OG chorded apple headphones. I suffered for 4 weeks. I was in denial that this investment could be so not worth it. But I finally caved and I'm so glad thatI did because I am so much happier using my $20 headphones than the $250 AirPods Pro. The original AirPods are great! I used them every single day. They are convenient, comfortable, and very compatible with my other devices. Unfortunately the AirPods Pro have been a major loss for me. Yes they do have unbelievable noise cancelling and transparency technology along with a great sound, but they are UNCOMFORTABLE and do not work for my daily life. Please save $100 and get the original AirPods! I wish I had mine back!",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-02-06,My go-to earbuds with just some slight issues...,"Where to begin— I consider myself an audio (and fitness)-phile since I work out and jog/run almost on a daily basis so of course, having a good pair of Bluetooth earbuds are essential to me. I’m thrilled apple released this so I’m going to state the pros and cons:
Pros — the noise cancellation DOES work. I was shocked and of course it may not block out loud traffic outdoors etc. (in my case) but I was able to test them indoors and I was impressed how well it blocked out most noises. I haven’t tested in the planes or during travel however. Also, the charge time is super quick, they fit comfortably (with ear gels), and they do NOT fall off when running. The case is compact and I just like the size of the earbuds. Never had an issue with Bluetooth pairing or connectivity (so far). Cons — for the insane price point, I would expect much better battery life. The battery life is trash. I owned a pair of Skullcandy earbuds that had much better battery life and were 1/3 of the price. I’d assume that one would have to charge these on a daily basis in order to use them everyday (for me may be every other day), which to me doesn’t seem all that practical. Another slight irritation or annoyance is that in order to turn the volume up or down, you have to “ask” Siri to do so. I don’t ever use Siri on my phone so this was a slight inconvenience to have to rely on her for something so simple when it could be done via touch or tap. But I’ve also never had any problems with Siri when adjusting the volume so I suppose these earbuds work the way they should.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-07,Magical earbuds,"I purchased AirPods Pro on January 14, 2020 and have used them for about 3 weeks. Build Quality
Like other Apple products, build quality of AirPods Pro is very good. Both AirPods Pro and case are made of glossy plastic. The case has built-in strong magnet that keeps AirPods in place even if case is opened upside down. Ease of Setup
I paired it with my iPhone XR and Google Pixel 4XL. Setting up with both phones were pretty easy. Paring process with iPhone can be started by just opening AirPods Pro case near the phone. Nice graphic images show up on phone screen and guide you through setup process and even explain some of the features. To pair AirPods Pro with an Android phone, you set up as regular bluetooth headphones after press-and-holding the small button on the back of case. You can confirm that AirPods Pro are in bluetooth paring mode by observing the little LED on the front of case turning from green to blinking white. Ease of Use
AirPods Pro are very easy to use. Thanks to Automatic Ear Detection (which can be turned off if desired), noise cancellation activates as soon as I put them in my ears. You will also hear a soft chime when AirPods Pro connects to nearby bluetooth-enabled device, which happens instantly usually. Note that AirPods Pro can connect to only one device at a time, so for example, you can't connect them to Macbook and iPhone simultaneously (which I can do with Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II). A single squeeze of AirPods Pro's stem, either left or right, will toggle between playing or pausing music. A double squeeze lets you skip to the next song. A triple squeeze will take you back to the previous song. These music controls worked on Google Pixel 4XL as well (tested with VLC media player app). A squeeze-and-hold of the stem will turn on or off transparency mode by default. This behavior can be configured to different actions on iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but not when connected to an Android, Windows PC, or any other non Apple devices. The only complaint I have is that I cannot change volume by just interacting with AirPods Pro themselves. It's a bit cumbersome to pull out my phone every time I want to change volume. Other wireless earbuds like Bose SoundSport Free have volume controls on earbuds itself. The only option to change volume on AirPods Pro without pulling out phone is to enable Siri on AirPods Pro (one of the squeeze-and-hold actions you can choose) and ask Siri to change volume, which is not as instant as it should be. AirPods Pro comes with silicon tips in three different sizes. The medium ones are already attached on AirPods out-of-box. You can replace them with small or large tips, but beware, they are very hard to take off from AirPods. But that's for good, because, if they accidentally detach from AirPods inside ears, they can be hard to remove or even dangerous. AirPods Pro stayed in my ears well during light gym work out. Noise Cancellation
Noise cancellation works surprisingly well. It's weaker than my Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II which I have been using for years, but it's definitely noticeable. I primarily use AirPods Pro in gym where Bose Quiet Comfort headsets are not adequate due to sweating. AirPods Pro's noise cancellation dramatically reduces mechanical noise from other nearby gym equipment. Transparency mode also does its job well. I can hear all the noise just as loud as I hear it without AirPods Pro in my ears. Audio Quality
AirPods Pro's audio quality is amazing for earbuds. They seem to have less clearer midrange compared Bose SoundSport Wireless which I had been using in gym but good enough for me for gym use. Charging
Charging through lightning connector and wireless charing both work as expected. For wireless charging, I used Ubio Lab's AWC 1080 charing pad. Battery Life
The advertised 4.5 hours battery life with noise cancelling on seems accurate. I have yet to test battery life of the case as I recharge both earbuds and case everyday. To see battery levels of earbuds and case on iPhone, put earbuds in case and open it near the phone. You will see battery levels of earbuds and case separately (see photo). On Macbook (I used 15-inch 2018 Macbook Pro), go to Bluetooth icon on menu bar and mouse over to AirPods Pro (see photo). You can even see battery levels of left and right earbuds separately. However, there is no way to see battery levels of earbuds or case on Google Pixel 4XL. Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II and Bose SoundSport Wireless show battery levels near Bluetooth icon, so this is a room for improvement for AirPods Pro, if Apple wants to sell AirPods Pro to Android users.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

These still sound amazing, have great connectivity, great noise cancellation, and overall good value for the money. However I’ve discovered them to become quite uncomfortable for wearing for extended periods of time. Knocking off two stars. There is no getting around that these are expensive for little earbuds. I was skeptical about buying them because of that, but any skepticism was shattered when I first tried them. First off, the active noise canceling works at a level you'd only expect to find in much larger sony or bose full-on headphones. The sound and build quality are similar stories. It is a worthy upgrade from the regular AirPods. Connectivity, asides from very rare and minor hiccups (inevitable for all Bluetooth devices), is exceptional. Overall these are not only a worthy upgrade from the regular Airpods but a decent alternative to some higher-end full earphones from other companies if your goal is to have a single pair of earphones to do EVERYTHING than these are worthy of consideration.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

For all the fuss about “Apple Price tag”, for its features it is competitively priced against Sony’s noise canceling buds and they do it better! Not just noise canceling but in every way. Sony’s is a bit too bulky and not easy enough to slip into your pocket without adding yet another huge bulge your phone and wallet already does. The AirPod pros are slim and only 10% bigger than the OG AirPods. But Apple gives up battery life to be able to be slim but only about 4-5 hours under Sonys. I love these for the gym and they definitely look a lot better than the comically looking AirPods before it was worn into trending status. It’s ease of use and integration makes it compelling to buy it over Sony’s If you have a iphone.

They rocked, until the other day when I popped them in and one of the airpods was completely dead. I tried to see the battery level on my phone and couldn’t get my phone to pop the info up- had to add battery life to my widgets just to see that my R bud was 0%, and the case and L bud were 100%. I thought maybe I didn’t have them in the case correctly so I took them out, put them back in, and a little while later my L bud was now 1% and the R was 100%. It made no sense but it completely ruined my workout. I unpaired and paired, I left case plugged in- I did every trouble shooting method I could think of but nothing’s working. Returning these for a replacement (which Amazon says will take weeks to come in 😡) and if that doesn’t work I’m going to buy directly from Apple and see if that makes a difference.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-02-14,Magical,"These are fantastic. Literally the most magical technology I think I’ve purchased to date. I was going to go with the Bose wireless, noise cancelling head phones. They are somewhat comparable in price, and known to be good quality, and Apple didn’t have any similar products. Plus I never was impressed with the quality of the Apple ear buds or AirPods anyway. They always fell out. But then the AirPods pros came out. Similarly priced to Bose, but 1) because I’m already an Apple user, I thought it would be easier to use with my iPhone, 2) they are truly wireless, and 3) they come with a nifty case that also quickly charges the earbuds wirelessly multiple times. That being said, I’m in love with them and I swear they are the most magical piece of technology I’ve ever owned. I’m no audio expert and I don’t use them for music much (nor am I an audio quality snob), so I can’t speak to the sound quality. But I use them on construction sites to help cancel engine noise while also being able to listen to podcasts at a lower volume, and for that they are absolutely perfect. Without having quantitative measurements, it feels like they cancel noise to about the same degree as ear plugs. They don’t fall out of my ears as I’m walking around and I use them pretty much all day. I’ve even used them underneath ear muffs. I can’t recommend these enough.

Though various youtubers were mixed and the audiophiles of course said they work fine for what they are and weren't the best. They fit fine in my ear with medium tips. After 1 month of lite use as in just a few hours or more a week on average it does a good job. just don't expect to be blown away and its all subjective. It doesn't tune out cars all the way like some people say you can still here them in the background walking next to them or 100 feet away. If you have your volume at 50 perecent it does feel everything is blocked out for the most part but the music is almost to loud for me but again thats preference.

Some things to be aware of: The airpods do not do as good a job of noise canceling the airplane drone vs the Bose, mostly because they don't surround your ear. The batteries on the airpods will run out before a coast to coast flight completes. Because they are bluetooth you will need a transmitter to send the signal from the plane's entertainment system. All of these points can be addressed or expected, but if you are replacing a wired Bose headset they should be anticipated.

The sound quality is the best I’ve heard from earbud style headphones and the battery life is as advertised (~5 hours depending on volume and ANC). These things also hold very well in my ears and I don’t have an issue with them falling out. My biggest complaint comes from the active noise cancellation feature. I live in a rural area where essentially all the noise in my bedroom comes from an air purifier. The ANC feature significantly reduces the noise of the air purifier compared to passive mode, but it doesn’t reduce it to the point where I’m impressed for the price. I’ve seen complaints about the current firmware reducing the effectiveness of ANC (these ones shipped with the most recent firmware installed and there’s no way to revert to the old firmware apparently). If that’s the case, then I hope Apple will crank the ANC capabilities back up in a future firmware update because these would then be an unbeatable pair of wireless earbuds. All in all, I like these things, but unless the ANC issue gets worked out I’m thinking I would have been better off getting 2nd gen AirPods over the Pros.

My old headphones had amazing sound quality but when I was on the phone with a customer or a co worker, they complained that they couldn’t hear me over the background noise. A co worker had a pair of AirPods and they did not experience any issues like this so I bought a pair. These AirPods are very impressive , much more so than I expected them to be. They’re also more comfortable than the regular headphones you get when you buy an Apple product. That was something I was also concerned about... overall, they compete on sound quality and comfort vs other brands, but blow the competition out of the water when you consider the person you’re talking to has to try and hear you over the background noise.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-02-23,Swing and a Miss,"I have all Apple devices but I was never able to use the regular Airpods because they just don't fit my ears and constantly fall out. Besides, it looks like you have a pair of Q-tips sticking out of your ears. Along came the Airpods Pro with the shorter sticks and, more importantly, earbuds that could fit in the ear canal for hopefully a tight fit. I really wanted to like these but there are some basic flaws I just couldn't overcome. First of all, the case and Airpods are made of a very sleek and SLIPPERY, plastic. I had to put a protective case over the charging case to keep from dropping it all the time. The Airpods are just as bad. Removing them from my ear to put in the case was an adventure every time due to the small, irregular, and slippery shape. Secondly, I got the best seal with the medium ear tips but something troubling kept happening. After a few minutes of talking, facial movement, etc., they would always work loose enough that the seal was no longer good and I kept having to push them back in. I tried different tips but just got worse results. These types of earbuds that only rely on the ear canal seal to hold the bud in place are really a non-starter for me and probably a lot of people. The best fitting earbuds I've always had had a secondary anchor like a wing tip to secure the bud in place. Unfortunately, the sound quality and the noise cancelation rely on a tight seal that couldn't be maintained. Thirdly, why did Apple put that stupid little button on the stem for control. The earbuds were already unstable in my ear and then I have to try to pinch the stem for music control without dislodging the ear buds? What happened to the regular Airpods touch controls with a tap? No way to control volume either unless you reach for your iPhone or your Apple Watch. You can always tell Siri to do it but when you're in an open office like me, that tends to annoy people. Bluetooth pairing is easy enough but one of the little gremlins in my Airpods was that when I switched between noise cancelation, off, and transparency mode in the control widget on my iPhone, when I went back and tried to use that functionality on the Airpods themselves later, it didn't work. Many times after I had paused the music from my phone, one of the Airpods would lose sound. It would still show up in the control center as connected but there just was no sound. I usually had to put them back in the case and take them out after a few seconds to get it working again. On a couple of occasions the sound from both Airpods stopped and I ended up having to re-pair them. All in all, my worst Apple product experience. The design flaws were bad enough but maybe livable but I cannot deal with the Airpods not working like they should. That was enough for me to send them back. Very disappointing, especially at that price point.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

For those of you who loved Airpods, but couldn't wear them for an extended amount of time without your ears aching, this is the product for you. The pros have a much more comfortable in ear fit, letting you wear them for extended periods of time and even forgetting that they are in your ears! For those of you who only want to listen to the music and not the many loud noises in your environment, this is the product for you. The noise cancellation is superb, completely blocking out the many noises on the bus or in the gym. An even greater feature of the pros is Transparency Mode, which uses the mics on the earphones to let in the voices of people speaking to you; so you can listen to your music while having the ability to communicate in any environment.

FIT:
Though I’m a fan of Apple’s Minimalist design, sometimes it can be a major downfall when it comes to a “one size fits all” approach to something as complex as the human ear. The shape of these AirPods simply don’t fit in my ear. If you already have difficulty with Apple’s wired earbuds staying in place, these also probably won’t fit you. Even with the variety of rubber tips, and when I say variety I mean the 3 sizes (many other earbuds I’ve purchased in recent years come with 6-8 for full customization) they won’t help because of the shape of the AirPod itself. SEAL:
Because of the shape, I can’t get a tight seal, so the noise canceling function is nonexistent as well as the transparency mode. SOUND QUALITY:
Wired headphones will always give you the best sound quality, these sound ok, but they’re comparable to Apple’s wired earbuds. SEAL TEST:
This is the most infuriating thing about the process, the whole thing is actually a scam to make you think you’re picking the right seal for your ear. It’s a slide show, it’s not actually sensing anything sonically. It makes for a “cool” product experience and unboxing, but it’s actually just smoke and mirrors. It has fooled too many people into thinking there getting a proper fit. These simply don’t work for my ear type, and it doesn’t make sense to pay for the features that won’t work for my ear shape. For people that can already use Apple’s wired earbuds without issue, these will probably work for you. As for me, I sent them back and got a refund.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple knows what’s up. The Transparency mode sounds far more natural than any other earbuds I’ve tried that have had something similar. You can turn it on and function perfectly normally by hearing everything around you. The active noise cancellation blocks out background, low-tone sounds. Sporadic, high-tones will still come through a bit, but they’re muffled. You’ll still be able to hear people talk to you, but it’s muffled. It’s perfect. The pass-through prevents that uncomfortable pressure from being built up in your ear. This relieves pressure on your eardrum, so you don’t need the volume as loud to hear your music well. The noise cancellation does the rest, by muting background noise. This might seem unimportant, but it honestly is making a huge difference for me. Since buying these, the average DB level that I listen to my music at has gone down from upper 70’s to mid 40’s.

I have had only like two times maybe where things disconnected from sound. I just put them in the case and bada bing things were back to normal. Also I sweat a lot at the gym and these are pretty great with it. When I say a lot I mean like I look like I jumped into a pool after the gym, but they don’t get affected from it.

The touch controls so far are a bit wonky, but I'll probably just control everything from my phone anyway. My only gripe thus far is the case. It's nice and the magnetic closure and magnets that hold the buds are great. However the lid moves ever so slightly back and forth when closed and makes this little clicking noise. Seems like a design flaw that makes it feel a bit cheap. Not the end of the world or a deal breaker though. I've seen other reviews that mention it too. Are these worth the price tag? Not so sure just yet as I've only had them for a day. But with the convenience of Amazon's return process, it's worth a shot if your on the fence.

I still have them so i will update later if it didn’t fix them. No update is good news. Cons: airpods pro on my pc are louder than with my iphone for some reason. The noise canceling was great and it became weaker but still effective. The mic is good for phone calls but not in my jeep. the wind noise are overwhelming for it. The regular airpods’ mic performed better in my jeep situation. Maybe because the mice is placed better on regular airpods. Pros: very very convenient for iphone users. Better than regular airpods in audio quality. Better in everyway except mic in wind noise environment. Would definitely recommend but it needs to be perfected by a great update.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-02-29,Apple should improve quality control! Don’t expect too much...,"The initial product that I received was defective. First, I thought it was just a software glitch but I soon realized that it was a hardware issue. To begin, the pairing was erratic from the beginning but I was able to pair it nonetheless. But the experience became more and more annoying unlike what Apple claimed. One in two occasions, the pairing will not work and when it does, the left side earbud simply doesn’t pair or when it does, it shows as “battery depleted” and quickly disconnects. To work around the issue, I followed the instruction to do a hard reset on the device. Sometime this solved the problem and other times it did not. This type of issues quickly becomes really annoying especially at the gym when you are ready to go and the $250 piece of product fails to work as intended. On the contrary, Galaxy buds and buds+ never had pairing issues, selective battery drainage/charge failure issues or random erratic failures with the left buds. At the end, the issues were resolved once I received a replacement - which, by the way, works well as intended with no major issues so far. Initial connection was smooth, there is no random pairing failure or one of the buds going out; however, the new, but moderately milder annoyance/issue is that when paired to my Apple Watch, as the song track changes, one of the earbuds volume becomes extremely low or no volume at all until I either change the volume up or down (which then corrects the volume disparity). This doesn’t happen all the time but I would say around 3 to 4 times in the 90min I was listening. I hope this is a software glitch that will be fixed with the firmware update. Now, the reasons I decided to keep and not move on to the competitor product: it works well with all Apple products (most of the time but not always), the sound quality is decent, the fit is good and comfortable and the noise cancelling function is better than what I expected. I just wish Apple was able to provide longer lasting battery life like...eh hem...buds+, especially this being their higher end product that demanded more $$$ than competitors. Airpods Pro is good but not great. The initial defective unit also left me with doubts about Apple’s quality control.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I have been using my regular iPhone 7 earpods (wired) for quite a while and been quite happy with them, especially because I've been using a very effective and cheap earpod covers anti-slip, which completely changed the usability of those earpods. I also have a pair of Bose earpods that have noise-reduction but are also wired and the little box with the control for on-off for NR is quite annoying. So, after some initial time spent with the Airpods Pro, I can say I'm very happy with the sound quality, the NR is probably not as good as the Bose, but good enough, and overall they are very comfortable to wear. I've only used them for a couple of conversations, so I still have to evaluate how good they are for phone calls. ------

Full disclosure: I'm an Apple fan-boy most days. There are a few things they make that I'm not, but for the most part I totally geek out on them. But these are fantastic. I told myself they were too expensive, and that my 1st gen AirPods were still going strong. I had those for almost 3 years and the batteries finally started to give up the ghost from almost daily use. I got some other headphones and while they were great (and way less expensive) it just wasn't the same. Then I went on a trip to Rome. I had no noise canceling headphones of any kind, and regretted that decision the entire time there and back.

The rubber fitting also wouldn’t stay on one of the headphones so the stupid thing kept getting lodged in my ear & I’d have to pull it out with tweezers 😳. Transparency is unnecessary to me. When I used them to workout they kept starting to fall out, especially once I started sweating. I don’t like Siri so I hate that you have to ask her to turn the volume up & down!

The thing is that you can get sound quality of this caliber for very little compared to these earphones. their biggest competitor, Samsung, offers an in-ear option with even better EQ balance for less than half the price. What makes the Airpods Pro, well, Pro is the other features that come with them. Currently there are very few earphones with ANC, and the tech packed into the Airpods Pro is exceptional. The other main feature, ""transparency mode"" is also fantastic. Unlike ANC, most other new earphones have this feature. the Samsung Buds also have this feature, but Apple's implimentation is a cut above other brands in this regard. Sounds coming from outside actually sound natural, instead of like they were put through a $2 microphone like in the Samsung Buds. One other feature I am very pleased with is the lack of microphonics, and sealing quality of the earphones. This has been a major issue for many other in-ear headphones for me. It becomes difficult to walk, or hear yourself talk with them in because of all the extra sounds that you have to deal with. Apple claims that the ventilation ports on the Airpods Pro prevent that, and it seems that this works. While not completely absent, the low pitched ""thud"" that accompanied each step was much less noticeable than any other in-ear option. Overall if you are not an audiophile junkie these are the best no-compromise option for wireless in-ear headphones right now, even if you are using an android phone it is still worth it to pick up these! Any other issues I have with the Airpods Pro are issues that I have across all of apple's Airpods and their implementation on the iphone ios.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Sound wise, they are comparable to the Jabra 65t’s I’ve had, but with smoother transition from Apple device to Apple device. That Apple “switchablity” is why I went with these over the new and improved Jabra 75t model. These AirPod pros are a little awkward taking out and putting back in the case, but I was just used to the smoothness of the original AirPods in that regard. (It’s possible I’m just not coordinated - I still fumble with my Powerbeat pro case a few months in with them as well). I DO think the magnetic closure of the AirPod pro case will make it the most secure out of all the wireless buds I’ve owned. If dropped, the Powerbeat pros as well as the Jabras pop right out and I actually lost a jabra down a vent. And I recall the original AirPods doing that at least twice. The AirPods pro active noise cancelling seems fine, not sure if it’s THAT much better than the 65t’s passive (or physically obstructive) noise cancelling. The AirPod pros are light and comfortable, even in a bed (Something that my Jabra or Powerbeat pros could never do) and I can easily forget they are in my ears.

The other issue I have had is they seem to cut in and out while connected to my S4 apple watch. They don't do it constantly, but it does happen once, every time I go to the gym. And once they start cutting out, they keep doing it until I turn Bluetooth off and back on again. They seem to play perfect from my phone and I can stay connected even with my phone on the other side of our office building... so the problem seems particular to the apple watch at the gym.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-03-15,First impressions,"Some quick info I discovered from use:
-Noise canceling mode reduces surrounding sounds. It doesn’t eliminate all other sounds. It equalizes the ear pressure. -Off mode is similar to wearing silicon earbud headphones. Surrounding sounds are heard, but they’re muffled. It does not equalize the ear pressure. -Transparency mode not only allows outside sounds, but it amplifies surrounding sounds. -There is an adjustment period to learn the best way to insert the AirPods Pro. I’m on day 3 & I think I have it figured out... maybe. Additional information:
I thought the Pro AirPods were uncomfortable for about the first day and a half. I’m still adjusting, but it is getting better every day. When I think back to when I got my original first generation AirPods they were also a bit uncomfortable for a while at first as well. I have to be honest, when I first heard about these new AirPods I immediately thought I didn’t want them. I made an assumption they were going to be similar to other silicone earbuds I’ve worn in the past. And to be fair they are in Off mode. Those other two modes have changed everything for me. I thought noise canceling would be too much noise canceling. Making me feel like I could only wear them indoors. But as it turns out the noise canceling is only a reduction of surrounding sounds. This reduction is almost perfect. When someone is talking to me I hear a muffled sound but I can’t make out what they are saying. So I reach up squeeze the AirPods Pro stem once to pause, then squeeze & hold for transparency mode, & ask them to repeat themselves. And to my surprise I can hear them better than if I had taken the Pro AirPods out of my ears. That’s because transparency mode amplifies the sounds around me. Recently I was walking my dog on the sidewalk whilst listening to a podcast in Noise canceling mode. I was really focused on the topic at hand. About half a block or more behind me I heard a sound that made me look. I turned back to see it was a Nissan fit. I was happy to know that I could hear a car approaching. One of my very favorite things about being in Noise canceling mode outside, walking down the sidewalk, listening to a podcast is that I no longer have to press pause or rewind a few seconds when a loud truck drives by. I can still hear them, but they no longer disrupt my listening experience. Another thing is that I can be really focused and productive at work in Noise Canceling mode. The nearby sounds around me are muffled & it removes all the other distant humming sounds in the room. When I take them out of my ears, or switch to Transparency mode I’m surprised by all the other distant sounds I never really noticed previously.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-03-16,I Was Skeptical Going From Headphones to Earphones ... but ...,"It's very hard to impress me when it comes to switching from headphones to earphones. That being said, the reason I wanted the Airpod Pros was because Airpods/Pros are discreet looking (not disappointed at all in that factor by the way.) I am and still am in love with my Beats Studio 2.0s. Before you roll your eyes and read the next review, I've found a way to improve sound quality in them, by upping the dB rating on iTunes for my music. My point is: my Beats Studio 2.0s are SUPER loud and the bass is smooth and rocky at the same time. But, for working, working out, etc., I have a hard time keeping them on. I did NOT want to pay $250 for …… earphones! Anyways, I finally had them delivered, ready to be disappointed, and I was … for about an hour. Once I got used to the sound, it started sounding more and more like my Beats Studios. Keep in mind that even if you hate Beats products, headphones are still always going to beat earphones when it comes to sound. But wow, these are so close to my Beats, and I am still shocked. Connecting them to your phone is easy, the bass is the best it gets with earphones (and I mean this in a good way, because the bass really does sound good if they're pushed all the way in your ear) and they're so discreet and nice looking! I know the design received lots of hate, and that's understandable. They look like mini hair dryers, or the water nozzle gun from Mario Sunshine lmao, but in reality, when they're in your ears, they look and feel amazing. They stay in so well, it's shocking. Seriously, if you take anything from this, know that I am a diehard and very picky headphone user, and listen to music constantly, and yet I'm still shocked. The only negative thing is Apple's greed which can get the best of people based on brand names. I can't justify the price range, so I would suggest waiting until they're around $150-200 (even though that'll never happen, so maybe you should bite the bullet and go for it!)",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

As for me, 70% when I used with OnePlus 7 Pro AirPods didn't connect when someone calling you, missed phone calls a lot. With iPhone it just works as supposed to. Music quality: it's neutral sound, you have to get used to it to appreciate, but not even close to Sony WF-1000xm3, and not as Bose SoundSport Free. But, all has own limitations . The Noise cancellation: I think it's a sales gimmick. Just use any airbuds with silicon tips and stick into your ears:) The transparency mode is useful, but not so well implemented as on Jabra Elite 65t/75t. The call quality in the noise environment handled well by AirPods Pro. Don't forget when you not speaking it will let noise in through microphones, but once you start talking it will fight it. And, the buds itself very slippery and because of that hard to pull it from charger case. Tried few Spigen cases and liked most Caseology case. The AirPods Pro a bit overpriced.

I had used the original Airpods for years and they were 10/10 awesome. No complaints. I was anxiously waiting for a new version so I had to get this once it was released. My only concern was the new in-ear design. I have tried in-ear headphones before and they all came loose on me. Never completely fallen out, just loose. So I was nervous about these new Airpods. Sure enough, they also come loose after about 15 minutes or so. I primarily use these at the gym, running, and walking my dog. I have tried different sizes and it seems the small earbuds work the best. The originals never came loose on me, not even on a half marathon. I never needed to readjust them after I put them in. It's a bummer, but not a huge deal. I kinda saw it coming
That's the only negative I have for the Pros. The audio quality is better than the originals, so is the battery life. But the real thing that surprised me is the noise cancelation. I didn't expect it to be this good. I'll be honest, I had low expectations for it going in. I had seen some bad reviews about it. But the noise cancelation is pretty legit in my opinion. The gym I go to usually plays music loud, and in the past I couldn't really hear a podcast with the original Airpods unless I jacked up the volume. But with these that's no longer an issue. It ""numbs"" the sound pretty well. I haven't tested them on an airplane yet so the jury is still out on that
Overall, I still recommend them even though they're pricy. Just know that if you've had issues with in-ear headphones before, you'll probably have the same issue with these",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

The amazon echo blew these out of the water in both noise cancellation and pass-through. The battery life was great overal and had no complaints with that. The overall ease of use with apple products i would for sure give 5 starts as these connected with such ease. These are also terrible for small eared people as they dont stay in at all.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-03-21,Flawed designs,"Airpods Pro have issues that you should know about before buying. I'll try to list the main points both ways. I bought these because they were the cheapest earbuds with ANC (active noise cancelling) on the market. Cons:
1) Uncomfortable (compared to other earbuds). These come with interchagable tips. None of them fit well. Maybe this can be fixed with third-party foam tips. 2) They fall out. The design is simply flawed. Other earbuds don't do this. To improve your odds of keeping these in your ears, be prepared to do a little ritual every time you put them in: wipe them down, then wipe your ears down, because the slightest bit of moisture or earwax and these things are going to slide out (and potentially fall!). Any activity you do makes this worse. Eating? These will fall out. 3) Desynch. I'm fortunate enough to have both android and apple devices. With both, for some reason, these things desynch all of the time. Most often when moving (especially when moving away from your device). Listening to your music half-a-second off in one ear is unacceptable. 4) Fixing desynch. You'd think desynch might fix itself, or you could pause them and unpause them, but no. To fix desynch, you have to pull out your case, put the pods in, close the case, wait, then when you pull them out, hope that the most common sounl problem doesn't hapen:
5) The most common sound problem: without changing any settings sometimes the volume is way lower than what you want. To fix, you put them away, wait, take them out, and hope it's working. I've had to do it 4 times in a row to get it working right. 6) Volume control. For some asinine reason, you can't change the volume by touching either airpod. You have to use your connected device. 7) Phone call. When you're on the phone, you might expect clicking the airpods' button to mute your mic or put the call on hold. Nope. It only hangs up. 8) Not configurable. Can't fix the above issues, because there are no configurable options. 9) Case doesn't have a latch. So, if you ever drop the case (which I've done twice), the door will fly open, and your airpods will fly away in random directions. This happened to me when pulling my wallet out of my pocket at a grocery store. The pods flew away under furniture which the staff had to help me move to find. Incredibly embarassing. 10) One color: blinding white. Black would be subtle. It took me a weeks of feeling like a tool to get used yo the judging looks of strangers. Bonus) On android, you can't see the battery level without downloading a sketchy 3rd party app (which I'd recommend against). Bonus) This may be harmless, but it's worth mentioning. Airpods Pro put out a higher-than-typical (highest I know of) amount of radiation. This is definitely safe in small doses, over your entire body, but this is somthing you may choose to wear a lot of the day, directly to either side of your brain. I don't think it's harmful, but you should at least know about this going in. Pros:
1) The case is nice. It's compact, recharges the pods, and wirelessly charges. It's even fun to flip the lid. 2) Active noise cancelling. These really are the cheapest earbuds with ANC on the market. If you neel ANC for some reason (say, your car has incredible amounts of road noise, or you work somewhere with a lot of ambient sound) then these are the least expensive solution. If you haven't used ANC, it's wonderful. Sometimes, it feels like black magic. 3) Very easy to pair with other devices. I like to switch what I'm using for different situations, and these make it easy. 4) Sound quality is good when it's cooperating. Overall, I'd suggest staying away from these for now. I recently got galaxy buds (not the newer plus model) with a phone upgrade. They're like $50 and objectively better in practically every way (although phonecalls are much better on the airpods pro), but they don't have ANC.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

I travel a fair amount for my job, and I typically take a backpack as a personal carry-on item; putting it on and taking it off repeatedly, I was constantly snagging my headphone cables and pulling them out of my ears. So frustrating. Once I switched to AirPods, life got a lot better. I first got myself some AirPods 2 when those came out, and I loved them. But then these ""Pro"" AirPods came out shortly afterward, and I wondered if the upgrade was worth it… I delayed purchasing until I heard some reviews from friends who also frequently travel by plane. They told me how the noise cancellation was so effective that (for the first time ever) they couldn't hear the ever-present plane noise while in flight. I was sold immediately! I can confirm that the noise cancellation does effectively remove the plane hum and noise from other passengers; it's fantastic! The last flight I was on, I was the only one in my immediate area that didn't have my hands clasped over my ears to hear the video I was watching over the plane noise. (If I'd been thinking, I might have tried to take a photo, because it ws funny to see how much everyone was struggling to hear their content.)

The AirPods Pros' aesthetic is much better than the first two iterations. Plus they're noise-cancelling, sound-isolating, and water resistant. What's not to love? Well, performance significantly decreases when noise cancelling is enabled, which is a disappointment. The headphones also have relatively weak connectivity. Props to Apple for finally putting out a product with sound-isolating capabilities. Even better, listening volume levels are recorded in the Health app, so users can be sure of their volume levels over time. For sanitary purposes, it's best to save in-ears for situations where they're specifically called for, and to clean them often.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

So can only charge it with my iphone’s adapter. This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive
+ noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation. +. Case is more comfortable than the last earbuds case i had
- no case display of battery life
- BIG negative is only 4 hr battery life while other earbuds are hitting eight and even eleven hours. There is no idle mode so as long as airpod pros are out of case they are losing a ot of juice. - big negative for me, as I wanted to fall asleep with these on ; is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. Angering. Also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable. + quickest instant connection to phone. All other bluetooth headphines I’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time I turn them on. +. Easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the Hearing enhancemebt mode. Granted the hearibg enhancement is barely anything. It would be more valuable if it was stronger. +. Siri interaction has proven positive however Alexa google et cetera are probably just as good. So this is more of a neutral than a positive. Same with the looks of it. Ninety percent of earbuds look good to me. - case could be flatter and more comfy in pocket
+ however it is more comfy than my last earbud case and mist earbud cases arw uncomfy in pocket. - price shouldn’t be mire than 150 for what this is. I’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the Cambridge 100$ ones or the Sennheiser $300 ones for myself. Maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because I have a positive impression of Sony from previous experience. But just 100 for the Cambridge with 9hr battery....or Sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud. - the fit isn’t great. Those old cheap earbuds I had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. These in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily. - though magnet case closure is nice, I will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that I can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. I currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain. - i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. Switched to a key chain case two days ago. + after these weeks of use I have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds I had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then I had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds. - i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways I use siri without any lacking, and so I do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. My friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups. +. However i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. A lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. However it does look thin and so I will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable. + i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by. - I’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations I had of a top line apple product. I would expect disappointments had I chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. I am considering dropping my rating to three stars as I feel like I am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. I might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size. I will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on Amazon, and I am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item. This was my first update of my review. I might do another update should I choose to just accept and keep these apPros for myself and not gift them to my sister.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",2,1,2020-04-04,The Emperor's New AirPods,"I'm surprised to see so many glowing reviews...
For my part, I find that the sound quality of these headphones leaves much to be desired -- especially when one considers how much they are being sold for. But the sound is unimpressive and problematic at times -- for example, I find the treble to be shrill and brittle in places. In fact, I think that a couple of headphones in the $30-50 range have superior sound to these AirPods. Also, there is a faint whisper of static in the background in transparency mode, as if the external microphone is running interference; it is subtle and likely not noticed by most listeners, but I can hear it (I suppose it's possible that my AirPods are defective on this score). Another possible irritant for prospective users involves the play/pause button: because the button is designed in such a way that there is no obvious indication that the button has been activated, and because there is a delay (typical of wireless headphones) between pressing the button and having your music begin/pause, there is an inevitable moment of doubt and uncertainty every time you use the button. For it is not immediately clear if the button has been pressed properly. In opting for a sleek and sexy design, the engineers failed to consider the lived experience of actually using the device. I should also mention that the headphones do not come with much instruction, and those instructions I did find on the Apple support page are, as of this writing, inadequate and unclear at times. (I am left with the sense that Apple is too hip to be helpful.) In sum, if you care about good sound quality and good value, you should think twice before making this purchase. You are primarily paying for the brand. The AirPods have some good features, but the emperor, if not completely naked, is scantily clad at best.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

When I initially started using them I was impressed, the sound quality was very good and the microphone worked well for my conference calls. When I listen to high quality music they're impressive, not as much with average recordings but good enough and better than most earbuds I've used in the past. On the first day of use, I charged them and started using them for conference calls and watching videos. About 3 hours into my day the right AirPod battery quit without notice, I tried to carry on my call but people couldn't hear me. I put the AirPod back into the case and after 5 minutes of charging I was good to go for the rest of the call. I like to listen to music with the volume up but not overly loud. The ANC really adds to the overall sound but listening with the ANC on and the music above the midpoint, I found that the battery didn't get anywhere close to what Apple have stated. Today was my 4th day using the AirPods Pro's, after about 10 minutes on my first call the right AirPod died, it shows full charge but I get no sound out of it whatsoever. I tried putting it back in the case, listening on different devices and even cleaning them but with no luck. Maybe I just got a bad pair of AirPod pro's so I'll give them another chance.

I've had this slip off during running and my ear canals hurt from using this so I decided to return and going back to my original AirPods. I considered a few options:
1. Buy the ear hooks - could work but kinda ugly and they don't fit in the case. 2. Memory foam ear tips - interesting option but not sure it's better than the silicone ones that comes with the AirPods pros. 3. Keeping my gen 1 AirPods for workouts and the pro for everything else.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,0,2020-04-08,"Sound pretty good, good noise canceling, good battery life.","UPDATED 04/11/2020 - Below is my initial, one and a half day review of the Apple AirPods Pro. After further use I have discovered that contrary to my initial impression, the Pros do provide somewhat better, deeper bass than the standard AirPods (with some music). That improvement isn’t always evident and depends on the type of music you’re listening to but it is there. I listened to Daft Punk’s ‘Random Access Memories’ and the bass was indeed deeper and slightly more impactful over the Pros that the AirPods 2 they replaced. I also found myself really grooving along to some of the songs on that album via the pros. These won’t satisfy bass heads and, they don’t sound spectacular or even truly “great”. But, they do sound pretty good given the chance with good, quality music. My AirPods Pros 2 wish list would include, even better bass (not just more bass, better quality bass), slightly better noise cancellation and an accompanying app in which you are able to not only change the NC settings (on/off/transparency) but also access the ear tip seal test as well as EQs. All those settings should be in one easily accessible place and currently they are not. To complete the ear tip seal test, you have to go into iPhone settings, down to bluetooth, then to the Pros, then down to the test. To change NC modes, either press and hold either AirPods stem or, press and hold the volume slider in control center to access those controls. Not too difficult but more fragmented that it should be. Overall, as most people already know, the AirPods Pros are a quality product. I’ve had no bluetooth issues. No dropouts, noise or other issues and calls I’ve made using them have been great. I haven’t tried Siri on them yet but I have confidence there won’t be an issue there either. Anyway, that’s about my three cents so I hope it’s helpful to someone somewhere. I have owned Airpods 1 and 2. They have always sounded good to me. Not great. Not ""audiophile"" quality good. But, definitely good enough to satisfy with most music and, for what they are. I received my Pros yesterday and have used them for about a total of four hours give or take. In that short usage time, I can say they sound... good. I'm actually a bit disappointed in the fact that so far, the bass doesn't seem to be better than the previous gens bass response. I was expecting more bass given these completely seal in ear. As opposed to the 1 and 2s that do not necessarily seal perfectly in most ears including mine. The benefit I most appreciate is that you hear a little more of the music than with the previous models. Even with noise cancellation turned off, there is such a good seal in my ear that I hear more details in the music/audio that I'm listening to. The difference isn't earth shattering or very dramatic but there is a fair difference in that regard. All three ear tip sizes create a good seal in my ears. I needed to make a small position adjustment of the airpod in my right ear to get a good seal with the smallest tips but they did seal after making that adjustment. Of the three sizes, I find the medium size tips that came pre-installed on the Airpods to be the most comfortable in use. Switching between noise cancellation and transparency mode is super simple and effective. Switching the noise cancellation off completely however means you have to use the connected device (iPhone/iPad) which is strange. Unless there is a way to turn noise cancellation off completely on the Airpods themselves that I don't know about. To sum up, I was expecting better bass response considering that these seal in the ear canal unlike the previous gens. If the bass is better, it's minimally better to my ears at least. There is an upgrade in how much detail is apparent in music I've listened to especially with noise cancellation turned on but even with it turned off I hear more. The noise cancellation works well enough but I have used better. Namely in Bose Q over ear headphones. So, for their size, simplicity and ease of use, these Airpods still win out in my book. Transparency mode is great. I can listen to audio but still hear things going on around me without having to remove either or both of the Airpods. I haven't had them long enough to speak about battery life. So far, they seem about the same as my previous gen 1s and 2s. Good product overall. I purchased mine direct from Apple so, I can't speak to the authenticity of the units sold here on Amazon.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Cutting through all the BS, these things are AWESOME! I recently retired and now spend a good bit of time on my tractor and a ZTR mower, both of which are loud. I, before now, used multiple types of techno toys to listen to my audio books and music while working. My hope was that the ‘noise cancellation’ feature of these babies would relieve my listening woes. Well, simply put, they did. It plain amazed me that I could crank my tractor up to 2600 RPM’s and could still easily hear the narrator of my book. Same for the mower. I can hear some outside noise, but it is non-consequential, I can still hear my books/music VERY well! I am quite pleased with these EarPods. My only gripe is the listening time per charge (roughly 4.5 hrs per charge), but this would probably be good for most. What I do is put them on charge when I go to the house for a drink or something to eat, they recharge fairly quickly. So again, I would definitely recommend these for those that use loud equipment and want to listen to music or books. I haven’t received a call while wearing them yet but will update when I do👍🏻
Update 4-14-20
I recently received a call while wearing these. I spent a good deal of time on the phone with my daughter while I was outside dragging brush, and it was quite windy as well. After hanging up and my book automatically restarting, I realized that I had not mentioned that I had my new AirPods in. So I called her back and asked if she could hear me ok during our last call. She said it sounded like I was holding the phone and talking. When I asked about the wind noise, she said she couldn’t hear anything but me. WAY COOL!!! I asked her to hold a minute and started up my Polaris Ranger and took off down the drive. When asked, she said she could hear something in the background but could still hear me fine. And as well, I could hear her just fine.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-04-13,Good Sound & NC. Not Suited For My Needs. Didn't Really Fit Well.,"The short review: Although these earbuds sounded good to me and the noise cancellation was good, I'm still returning them. They don't seem to fit properly with either the small or medium ear pieces and they are a bit large in the ear for sleeping, which is one of the main things I wanted them for. I think they'd be great for the vast majority of people, they just didn't suit me. The longer review: I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate music that sounds good. I enjoy using headphones and hearing nuances in the music that I miss when listening on speakers. However, the only time I use headphones are when walking, the occasional airplane trip, and for sleeping. Yes, I'm one of those people who need sounds to sleep. I don't use headphones every night, but when I'm bored with the TV I turn to my music to get sleep. For many years I used a set of cheap wired earbuds that worked fine. The sound was good, they stayed put, and they didn't hurt my ears. But there was no noise cancellation, which was a pain on an airplane and when I wore them to the gym, and the wire meant I had to wear my ipod in a holder on my arm which sometimes caused it to get rubbed by something and change the volume. Not a pleasant thing while trying to sleep. Finally, after more years than could be reasonably expected from a cheap pair of earbuds, they gave up the ghost. Since I got such good results with my original wired earbuds I ordered the exact same thing. The fact that the price had dropped from $15 to $8 should've been a warning sign, but I ordered them anyway. How far wrong can you go for $8? Anyway, it appears the company has changed the way they're making these earbuds and the sound was awful. So I decided it was time to join the 21st century and get a pair of wireless earbuds. Besides, being stuck in the house for several weeks due to COVID meant I was craving a new toy. And I saved a bunch of money by cancelling 2 cruises so the $240 price of these wasn't that bad of a shock. After much research and reading I ended up ordering these AirPod Pros. They arrived quickly and I immediately opened them, paired them to my ipod, and spent a while listening to music while I read a book and my husband had the TV on. The sound quality was really good (remember, I'm not an audiophile and YMMV) and the noise cancellation was unlike anything I'd ever experienced (in a good way!). After a half hour or so my ears started to feel a bit sore so I changed out the default medium-sized earpieces for the smaller ones. The sound quality and noise cancellation wasn't quite as good with those, and I tried shuffling through the various settings (sometimes by accident because the button is easy to hit when you're adjusting the earbuds) and finally got it to where it was acceptable. I only wore them another half hour or so and they felt fine. The big test was when I wore them to bed. It was great to leave the ipod on the nightstand and not worry about having it on my arm where I might accidentally turn up the volume if I roll over. While laying on my back the earbuds didn't feel too bad, but I'm more of a side sleeper. I've been sleeping with earbuds for years and can sleep on my side with one hand cupped over my ear to keep the earbud from smooshing up against the pillow, so I tried the same thing with these. Unfortunately, because the earbuds themselves are larger than wired ones, to accommodate the wireless stuff I guess, I just couldn't lay there without pressing on the earbuds and causing soreness in my ear. I tried for a while and finally took them off. So I'm returning them. The sound quality and noise cancellation are great, but they just never felt that comfortable in my ears and were a bit too big for sleeping. I also don't think the battery would've lasted through the night, but at this point that's a minor detail. I'll keep looking for something suitable and might just stick with wired ones.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-04-13,"Another hit from apple, concerns with longevity, competition from sony","The Airpods Pro are IMO definitely worth upgrading to from the original airpods. Using a seal the pro is able to produce much better lower frequencies. You also don't really feel the soreness or pressure some earbuds can cause. ANC and transparency mode really make them feel like they're in a completely different class. I'm not a fan of the lightning charging port, but they at least include a lightning to usb cable (not cheap) and wireless charging. My main concern is with the battery. 4.5 hours is more than enough for continuous play, and the fast charging is pretty incredible (3 hour recharge in 15 minutes). However 4.5 hours is one of the worst in its class, and doesn't leave much room for battery degredation. Relying on aggressive fast charging gives me serious concerns over the product's longevity. I wouldn't be surprised if these need replacing in 2-3 years. This is really the only reason I can't give them a 5
Competition (sony wf-1000xm3)
There's not a lot of competition IMO, however the sony's really hold their own. The sony's are much larger and heavier, yet still somehow seem to maintain a very comfortable fit. The case on the sony's is enormous and certainly not pocketable. The sony's case does get a usb-c port, but is missing wireless charging. They don't have good waterproofing for exercising, and their size makes them a bit awkward for that anyways. That being said they're often as much as $50 cheaper than the airpod pros, but get 6 hours per charge, and sound equally good (if not better). Noise cancelling is probably slightly better on the sony's and the added bass is better for genres like hip hop or EDM. If you're only going to use them at the office (instead of for travel or exercising) I'd actually recommend the sony's. They're cheaper, sound better (to me) and don't have battery issues. Otherwise the airpod pros seem like the better all rounder",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-13,"Great sound anywhere, even in the shower","Fortunately I managed to lose my first generation airpods, case and all, so decided to upgrade to these. They are a quantum leap forward. Not only do they fit better in my ears due to the custom sizes, but even without noise cancelation turned on, they do a great job of eliminating outside sound. The transparency mode works great- sound quality is the same, but you can listen out for important things/people. I am a classical musician, and this music has a lot of pauses and soft passages, which the noise cancelation shows off very well. Also, the sound changes very very little with it on compared to off, which sounds the absolute best IMHO. I miss the total comfort of the originals as well as the ease of tapping vs. squeezing; but the differences are worth it and I understand why Apple made these changes. The sound is very flat and natural, not overly bassy. If you want to change the EQ, that can be done within settings. And, I just took a shower with them in. Could also work in a bathtub I presume. Nice to have Siri and all controls available even in the shower! Bathroom speakers work, but not with this great sound, and noise reduction! I own some excellent and more expensive full sized headphones that are great for listening critically, but these certainly hold their own. I like them more than the wired Bose earbuds I used for long time until the wires frayed. Finally, I have a full beard and even though these new Airpods are shorter than the original and the ends are within my beard, people tell me my sound on the phone is perfect. So, I would recommend these to any iPerson who can afford them.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

And then my mac started randomly dropping and being unable to connect. I couldn't use it for a video call and had to go back to my old headset. I also noticed the buttons didn't work when connected to my computer. Oh, I could set up the functions for each ear and press the ""button"" once, but then they would stop working. I'd have to pull them out of my ears and try to reconnect the computer. Then they stopped working with my phone. Battery level was fine, but useless. Finally the computer stopped connecting at all.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-15,Amazing Sound AND Comfortable!,"I wasn't sure I would like the AirPods Pro. It's been awhile since I had a pair of ""in-ear"" earbuds and I was perfectly content with my first generation Airpods. But I'm easily lured by shiny new technology and had to try them out. Here are a few thoughts:
1. They're comfortable. There are multiple size ear tips that can be used to customize the fit. The ear tips are a soft material that sit easily and comfortably inside the ear. 2. The noise cancellation is pretty impressive. I have Bose QC25s and Beats Studio 3s and the Airpod Pros make a good showing up against the two sets of noise cancelling headphones. (I know neither are rated the best as noise cancelling headphones but just comparing to what I have.) 3. The case is just a touch larger than the original Airpod cases but just so. Still pocketable and still tiny. 4. Battery life is excellent; I haven't charged them more than once in the last month with using them once every few nights for an hour or so. I've heard some people using both the first or second gen. Airpods as well as the Pros; I've been doing just that the last month. When I want to tune out everything around me, I use the Pros. And when I need to hear what's going on around me, and I'm not so fully immersed in what I'm listening to, I use my first gen. Airpods. (The pros have a ""transparent mode"" that allows the listener to hear things going on around them; it works! But I still try to get some use out of my first gen. here and there.) It's impressive tech, and I can't wait to see what the next few generations of the Pros have to offer.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",4,1,2020-04-16,A thorough and honest review,"I've been the owner of these Airpods Pro for a few months now. When I first bought them, I was wondering (as most people probably are) is it worth the price? The answer is yes and no. They have good sound quality, and the noise cancelling works well. I haven't had any problems with the sound quality so far. As a young teen girl I use the middle-size fitting, and I don't have an issue with them falling out. Some problems I've had with these Airpods however is that they can disconnect randomly. This never happens when I use my Chromebook, but sometimes if I close an app while on my phone they can disconnect. I have a Motorola 7, which is an android, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the issue. Whatever the reason is, it can get frustrating when I have to turn my Bluetooth on and off again to get reconnected. Also, the battery life on the Airpod Pros is not very good. It only lasts a few hours before needing to be charged again. This is frustrating if you're like me and use your Airpods for school. Overall, I think these are handy and easy to use. But the price is a bit extreme. Though I enjoy using them and use them almost everyday, I think a more reasonable price for them is $150. However, I have no regrets buying these and will continue to use them.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",5,1,2020-04-18,AirPods Pro vs Powerbeats Pro,"This will not be an exhaustive review of the two products. I lost my Airpods Gen 2 on a flight and after some (probably too much) research I decided to buy the Powerbeats over the Airpods primarily for two reasons:
- I've never been blown away by the sound quality of AirPods
- AirPods just dont fit my ear canals well
I've used the Powerbeats for 4 months now and the sound and the fit is really good. However, after an hour or two the loops do get uncomfortable. I'm really impressed with the battery life of the Powerbeats. Believe it when they say 9 hours. Im on a LOT of conference calls using either my phone's bluetooth or my laptop bluetooth for MS Teams or Zoom meetings. The first weakness I saw with the Powerbeats was when people commented that the microphone sound quality wasnt very good. Previously, I used my AirPod G2s which were great sound an microphone for calls. Since Covid, Im in even more conference calls and the Powerbeats just arent comfortable, and the PC connection is troublesome. I broke down and ordered the AirPod Pros and used them this week. Bottom line:
- They are very comfortable for a day of meetings
- The battery life is just 4 hours so that's a drag
- Call Quality is excellent
- Connection to phone and PC is fast and reliable
- the new ear pieces fit my ears MUCH better than the G2s
- the case is small so carrying them in my pocket is EZ again
- The PBs still sound better with music
- I will use the PBs for workouts and yard work since the fit is great
I hope this helps any of you facing the decision on AirPod Pro vs Powerbeats Pro. If you have the budget, give Apple all your extra money and buy both of them... Spread out the purchases so your 'significant other' doesnt catch on.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Clarity and noise free conversations for those on other end was very important to me. I found inexpensive buds that were great for music considering price. Unfortunately none really deliver on quality conversations for phone use. This one has and no complaints. The one area that is sorely lacking however for me is my comfort level with silicone tips just don’t cut it. Painful is right word but thats me to. I have bony inside canals and foam is only thing that works consistently. I found solution and awaiting quality memory foam ear foam tips and in mail. Will update after received. The silicone tips just didn’t cut it. In fact busted one trying to remove from buds after attempting to exchange out with other tips. Because of everything else so good i decided to fork out the dough for the memory foam tips based on reviews. Hopefully will come through on expectations. Will update then. UPDATE- pain greatly reduced by changing position in ear. I found a ‘sweet spot ! By changing the post position - about 70 degrees from vertical. I don’t have much skin in ear - and bones conflict with slight oval seating of tip. I still thing memory foam will be ticket for best fit. But silicone tips can work in a pinch. Gotta play with them.

Pros and Cons,"If these were $150, I'd say they were absolutely worth it and everybody should buy them, no questions asked. If they were $200, I'd say that's a fair price for what you are getting. At $250 I think it's a bit of a stretch for some, however, I am glad I bought them. These Airpods replaced my Sony MDRXB50AP which are not wireless. I also have some wireless earbuds that I never used because I didn't think they were loud enough and the looks weren't that great in my opinion (Soundmoov 316T). Airpods Review:
Pros:
- Noise cancelling works much much better than expected. - Sound quality compared to any of my previous earbuds is also much much clearer. - Much louder than my previous wireless earbuds (but not quite as loud as the wired Sony's, but close)
- Siri automatically reads any messages received (very helpful IMO)
- Siri is easy to use
- Pairs automatically (other wireless buds also connect automatically, but it's sometimes not as fast/seamless)
- Findmyiphone can show you where they were last connected. (This feature could be improved, however, it's still better than nothing + if they are connected and lost in nearby you can make them play a sound so that you can more easily find them)
- Bluetooth is strong. I can be pretty far away from my phone, even if I'm outside and the phone is left inside, I can go farther than expected. Cons:
- Bass is not nearly as good as my Sony's. I don't know what people are talking about when they are impressed by the Airpod's bass... it's trash. Though, to be fair I think the improvement in sound quality makes up for this and more. - I think these are about $50 overpriced but this is subjective.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",3,1,2020-04-21,Awesome....but 2 huge issues,"I have always loved the sound quality of the wired Apple headphones of the past and when Apple announced they were releasing a wireless bluetooth version of the headphones with the 1st generation airpods, I wasn't sold immediately. I thought they would lack in the sound quality department and honestly, I was afraid they would fall out of my ears. When I finally took the plunge and paid the $150 for my first pair of airpods, I couldn't believe I waited as long as I did. Not only was the sound quality great, the comfort and light weight feeling of them in my ear was awesome. Sometimes I would forget I was even wearing them. Needless to say, I became a huge fan of the airpods and would recommend them to anyone who was interested in buying them. Fast forward to the release of the Airpod Pros. I absolutely loved the idea of noise canceling airpods. As much as I wanted to get them, I refrained because my first generation airpods were still going strong. Well, I ended up losing the case for my airpods so it gave me an excuse to finally buy the airpod pros. First the things I love about these headphones. The sound quality is still top notch but not any different than the previous generation air pods. Where these airpods shine is with the noise canceling and transparency features. For an ear pod, the noise canceling is surprisingly good. When turned on, it almost feels as if your ears are being vacuum sealed and you can immediately tell that high pitched sounds around you become silent. The airpods also have a transparency mode that basically work as the opposite of noise canceling to allow noises to enter your ear so you don't have to continually take the airpod out if someone is talking to you for example. Neither feature effects the sound quality of the airpods in a negative way. Although the sound features are great, there is two major flaws with these headphones. The first issue I have is the comfort. These airpods are nowhere near as comfortable or lightweight feeling as the previous generation airpods. This is largely due to the ""ear cushions?"" that were added to these airpods to assist with the noise canceling feature. I find my ears starting to hurt a bit after wearing these for a long period of time because of the pressure of these cushions. I feel this is a setback for the airpods because it basically defeats the purpose of the name ""airpod."" I can definitely tell I'm wearing headphones the whole time. The other big issue I have with these headphones may just be with the ones I purchased but it’s probably the most annoying one since these are not cheap headphones. The best way I can describe this issue is that the left airpod, especially when it’s in transparency mode, has a slight static sound whenever I speak at a higher tone on a phone call or even when they are just in my ear with nothing playing. It’s almost like the sound a busted stereo or car speaker makes or when there is a loose wire on a speaker and you wiggle the wire and it makes a static sound. I’m not sure why it started doing this but it is really frustrating since I’ve only had these airpods for a few months. Again, this may just be an issue with my airpods but it is the main reason I've given this product 3 stars.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

When they work, I truly enjoyed the sound quality and noise cancellation feature of these AirPods. But literally within the first day of using my AirPod Pros I started experiencing Bluetooth connectivity issues. The AirPods would randomly start getting static every so often when I would start walking and then go back to normal. I thought this was a fluke so I let it go and didn’t think much of it. About a week later and I’m using them today and the same thing keeps happening, but worse. They would get so much static but this time it wouldn’t go away, so I would have to stop my song and try and reset them. Eventually the right bud just went out and wouldn’t come back on while the left remained in/out of static periodically. Needless to say I’m sending them back tomorrow for a replacement pair, I liked them that much when working. I could have just got a bad, faulty pair? Who knows. But it’s disappointing to spend $250 on a item and it not work properly. I would say this fault is most definitely on Apple and not Amazon however. Amazon provided me with the return label no questions asked and are sending me a new replacement pair in due time.

Apple,AirPods Pro,"Amazon              ","en-US     ",1,1,2020-04-26,Fell out when running high intensity tempo run,"I have only had these for 1 day and I am debating whether or not to return them. I have had every generation of the airpods (e.g. Airpods 1 and Airpods 2). Why did I get these? Well, because I lost my previous Airpods and I was intrigued by the anti-sweat claims of this product. However, I am on the fence as to whether to return them because after about 30 minutes of a hard run, the silicon tips kept coming out. Every time I would try to push them back in it was awkward because I was running fast. What's more, each time I tried to readjust the tips and jam them into my canal (imagine me doing this running a 6:30 mile), I kept hitting the button on the stem and stopping/the music. For the last 10 minutes of my run I just threw the airpods into the treadmill cup. I am now trying smaller buds in hopes that they will work. I will say that the noise cancellation and the transparency mode is amazing. The speaker and sound is superb. But that won't mean much if my main use case (running with these on at high speeds and with lots of sweat) doesn't work. I will update this review in a week or so. UPDATE: I am definitely returning these. The first Apple product that I am extremely disappointed in. The left Airpod fell out multiple times during my run yesterday at high intensity. What is more, the Airpod has started emitting a high-pitched squeak/squeal sound. You can do a Google search on this and many users have complained of this. It appears to be related to the noise cancelling feature and there is definitely a design flaw. I'm disappointed and will be going back to the Airpods 2. I really wanted to these to work, but for serious runners, I would look elsewhere.",https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_srt?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=recent&formatType=current_format&language=en_US

They sound pretty similar to regular AirPods. After extensive testing between the two, I couldn’t find a difference *except in bass* where ironically the regular AirPods had much better bass that shakes your ear while the pros are a light thud. As a bass head, immediately not a fan. Design:
These use silicon ear tips instead of the classic airpods design and that’s another reason I decided to return them. After a while they gave me a sharp pain in my right ear which the old ones never did. Noise-Cancelling:
This is easily the best feature about the AirPods. The implementation of ANC is probably the best of any in ear in the market, however i don’t think considering the aforementioned trade offs that it’s worth it for me personally. To sum it up if you already have airpods only get these if you want the noise cancellation and don’t mind in ear silicon tips.

Also the bluetooth connection is s_ _ t! It crapped out on me after about a week of use so only one pod would work at a time even after numerous repairing attempts. It’s nice that the nub is shorter and less in the way but the actual head speaker is larger as well so beware of that for smaller ears. (Although with the different sized rubber inserts the issue of fit could be fixed. my opinion, Stay with the OG pods! Much more comfortable and cheaper too!

About a year ago I purchased the standard AirPods 2, despite being a bit skeptical I would actually use them regularly. Within a week I had changed my mind, as having these tiny imperceptible earbuds to play music and talk on the phone without the hassle of wires was a complete game-changer. Still, there were downsides. They allowed lots of external noise through, and the audio quality wasn't exactly breathtaking. The AirPod's Pro have built on the foundation of the original design and made it ten times better. They're smaller, stay in the ears better, and sound great for earbuds (though nothing will compare to a good set of headphones). The noise-cancellation is my favorite feature. Sometimes I have them in at work without music playing at all just to drown out the various noises and humming of machinery. Putting them in and suddenly experiencing quiet has provided me with a profound sense of calm when I needed it. Transparency mode is great for when you need to focus on the world.

I was extremely excited to finally get a pair of these. What a disappointment. First month I had them they were good, I really enjoyed them. Not long after that the quality deteriorated rapidly. The AirPods will not sit correctly in their case, so when you think they are charging they aren’t, even when you double check to make sure they are fine, they will die in your pocket while they “charge”. You go to put them in and only one is charged which is extremely frustrating. The other down side is the sound quality itself. While the noise cancelation impressed me, the earbud itself has the same problem as the normal apple headphones, the sound quickly becomes rattly.
