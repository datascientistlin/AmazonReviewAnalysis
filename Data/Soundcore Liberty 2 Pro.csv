Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-10-10,Had higher expectation but quite disappointed,Base is good but quite overpowering. Sound quality is good but not the best. Sony mf-1000xm3 has much better sound overall. Fitting is awful...tried all eartips but still keep on slipping. Comfort wise they are ok.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-10-10,"Work great, worry about loss.","Really good sounding headphones. Only downsides would be the lack of volume control and they could look cooler.... AirPods look cool, these look like bluetooth earpiece from the early 2000’s .... mainly want them for working out and occasionally at work so I don’t really care what they look like. Update: I have since downloaded the app, and noticed there is an option to program the single button on each pod to be a volume control if pressed twice. So they do in fact have volume control. They have fallen out of my ears a couple times, I think I’ve tried all the ear pieces. This worries me a little because while I’ve noticed when it happened so far... I’m afraid eventually I won’t. I think AirPods Albert you when they fall out, and you can locate them? If so that would quickly pay for itself after a replacement set of anker libertys..."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-10,I love them!,I got my earbuds today so I don’t have much mileage on them yet but the sound is beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of bass and the clarity that these can deliver. Soundcore has taken the foundation from the Zolo brand and brought it to an even higher level. I just wish I had bought two.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-10-12,Work for me!,"I listen to podcasts while I try to go to sleep and let them play all night long. These earbuds work great for me. I don't have to discern between the best bass or treble. I am mainly listening to talking or music for sleeping. Eight hours is enough time for me to sleep for the night, so that works great too. And I can recharge the buds quickly in case I am having one of those sleepless nights and go over 8 hours in bed without sleeping. I am pleased with these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-10-13,Noticeable Background Static and Cannot Pair to Multiple Bluetooth Devices,"I was between the Jabra's and these, I bought these because they had usb-c and wireless case charging over the Jabras. These are cecent headphones with high quality sound and noise isolation. They fit well in the ear, I ran a couple of miles and they were still snug. Why 3 star rating? 1. There is background static, I'm not sure why it's there but its unacceptable. It's pretty loud between pausing and playing. It less noticeable when you're playing actual audio
2. No support for multiple Bluetooth devices! I have a personal phone, a work phone, tablet, bluetooth treadmill. For me to pair to each device I have to unpair the other device. Way too much of a hassle! 3. There are not enough control options in the soundcore app. Only double press and long press. For the price paid, I'm going to have to return these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-10-13,Amazing Sound,Amazing sound quality! I love that I can use just the left or right earbud. On other products I have used you could only use the right one if you wanted to use just one ear piece. It has a slight background static sound when audio first stops. But I got used to it and stopped noticing it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-10-15,Great Once Firmware is Updated,"I listen to a lot of Dance Music. On these, the sound is awesome, provided you update the firmware. Prior to updating the sound had screw scratching noises with the synth percussion, and that was not good. Anker went above and beyond with my issue, and I am pleased to say that the firmware update fixed the scratching sounds. Now, these sound robust and crisp and what I would expect from an Anker product. Thank you Anker for updating the firmware and solving my issue. I'll use these all the time now for exercising."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-15,The best Anker has put out.,"To be totally transparent, Anker sent these to me as a replacement unit. I'm very grateful to get my hands on these, as I would normally not spend this much on buds. I'm more of a sub $100 guy LOL Sound/feel/fitment are all outstanding. They provide numerous wings and tips to get a good fit. Through the app, you can try out different EQ pre-sets or even create your own custom. This is achieved through their software, via a ""hearing test"". You can also customize button functionality. (There is a button on the side/top of each bud) The case has a nice and tacky feel, and has a cool slide open feature. It charges with USB-C, which is nice. I have used the liberty airs, lites, and neos. These blow those away easily. Very happy with these, and am thankful for Ankers stellar customer service."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-10-15,5 star,I never leave reviews . But my first impressions of these are awesome. Perfect fit and very impressive sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2019-10-15,"OK, but not good enough.","Anker got a lot of things right with the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro. But some of the really big things just aren't good enough. First, setup was a bit fiddly. For some reason my iPhone 11 Pro (iOS 13.1.3) Bluetooth only found ""Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro-L"" which I assume meant the left earbud, though both left and right worked fine after pairing. That was a bit strange. Eventually, it showed both Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro and Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro-L in the Bluetooth settings. Deleting the ""L"" version made no difference to functionality, and the earbuds both worked. I'm pleased to see that the set reports its battery life (of the earbuds) to the iPhone. However, you don't see each earbud individually in the iOS battery widget or in control center - just the pair (what I assume is an average). If you download the Soundcore app it will show you both earbuds individually. After the setup, you'll still want to use the Soundcore app to tailor the EQ. I found bass booster to be the best for my particular ears, even with the largest inserts to ensure a tight seal in my ear. The bass isn't overpowering to me on this setting at all, though it might be for some depending on their ear shape. e.g. I can push the earbuds further into my ears (they don't stay there when I let go), and the bass is way more intense. So I imagine ear shape is going to play a massive factor here. But there are issues:
1.) These are fatiguing. There's no getting around it for me - if I'm using the larger inserts to ensure a tight seal and a semblance of bass, they fatigue my ears in ways the AirPods don't. Yes, the music quality etc is a little ""better"" with these over the AirPods, but AirPods I can wear all day and not be bothered. These? 20 minutes is hard work. Even after trying multiple different sizes and types, I couldn't find any inserts that worked for me without fatigue. 2.) The biggest issue: the ""static"" sound. I have absolutely no idea why these behave like there's ANC (active noise cancelling) present, because there isn't. On quieter pieces you're always aware of the static sound if you're sensitive to it (and probably even if you're not) and in between tracks it's really present. Pausing a song/movie etc, and the static goes away after a few seconds (a form of earbud sleep mode, no doubt - to conserve battery). I've no idea what's going on here, but I don't like it. Not one bit. 3.) Phone call quality. I tried using these for a Skype and FaceTime call, and the quality is truly dreadful. First, because your ears are ""plugged"" by these earbuds, you'll find yourself talking too loudly anyway, and it's just not comfortable to talk with your ears plugged, either. Second, phone voices are presented to you in tinny fashion, and callers on the other end said I sounded tinny/thin, too. Switching back to AirPods is revelatory for phone calls, either WiFi-based or cellular, for both me and my callers. These Anker earbuds are hopeless (in my testing) for phone calls of any sort. Both earbuds have a microphone, but there's no beamforming between then that I could tell. With both in, I found that only the left earbud's mic was active. 4.) Connection stability: Zero issues staying connected to my iPhone 11 over many hours. 5.) Case quality and charging: I like that you can wireless Qi charge the case/earbuds or charge via the USB Type-C to USB A cable (included). Also, I love the way the earbuds magnetize themselves into the case (like AirPods). This is very satisfying, as is the sliding mechanism to open and close the case. The case is much, much bigger than the AirPods case (over twice as large when you take into account height and width). 6.) iOS integration: I really like how you can pull an AirPod out of your ear, and the music etc pauses. Super great if someone needs to talk to you. No such integration with the Ankers. Overall, I prefer the AirPods by far. Contrary to the popular opinion, AirPods actually sound pretty darn great for what they are - (and no, they do NOT sound the same as wired EarPods, which are not great at all). For some, the Anker set will do it better, but for me they don't in pretty much any way. While many of my issues are subjective, the static sound really isn't, and this was a major deal killer for me even before anything else. 3 stars out of 5. OK."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-16,Outstanding!!!!! Highly recommend :-),"Amazing sound. Never before have I had a set of earbuds that produce such amazing sound. These give you true sound reproduction equal or better than most wired over the ear studio monitors. Rarely does a product live up to its media hype. This one is a rare exception. Highs are crisp, mids are full and balanced and bass response is outstanding, full and pleasant. No band is over driven and the sound reproduction is real and true to the original. At last True Studio quality completely wireless in-ear monitors. OK, they are not cheap.. but you definitely get what you pay for. Considering that they are 1/3 less than bose, offer better sound, are smaller and lighter.. It's a WIN/WIN... Extra cash in your pocket and great sound in your ears. Who could ask for more. Not only are the beautiful, the're comfortable too. Attractively packaged with a complete assortment of sizes to fit most any ear. Rarely do I ever ""Highly Recommend"" a product. These are outstanding and I highly recommend you give them a try. If you are in the market for wireless earbuds, these are the ones to get. You will not be sorry!!!!!! :-)"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-10-17,"Nice, worth the money","Very comfortabl, slight buzzing that you can get used to. Great quality sound, little sibilant but can be fixed in app with eq."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-20,Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,These earbuds work great and sound amazing. The bass and highs are clear with no distortion. The set came with tons of accessories and the buds were very easy to connect with bluetooth. Music sounds awesome and I am very happy I got them. I love the carrying case they came with and the battery lasts a really long time. I definitely recommend the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro wireless earbuds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-10-20,A headset with great potential squandered by its overpowering bass.,"Introduction
I do my best to keep my expectations in check when judging the sound coming out of these buds. I paid ~$160 and for that price and lower, I could get me a good pair of headphones from companies that focus purely on audiophile products like Sennheiser or HIFIMAN that will sound much more accurate and be overall much, much more enjoyable. However, these are in-ears, that are bluetooth. This is going to clearly not going to give you the true audiophile, reference-quality experience that over-ears can provide you. So if that's what you're seeking, Anker has not yet achieved that in this form factor. Sound
The whole ""10 grammy guys approved these"" could be misleading. You might expect (and I certainly had hopes) that behind all the PR jargon of being so studio quality that they would at least sound as neutral as possible. The description says the drivers in these things provide ""stunning power,"" and honestly, yeah they're pretty dang powerful when it comes to the low-end. Ear rattling at high volumes, and still too overpowering at lower volumes. The bass itself doesn't fall victim to distorting, but I find it too forward and wide, and a tad too much of the details in the mids and highs become lost in songs with heavy bass. It does have a benefit of making songs with lower levels of bass exciting to listen to though. You could also find these enjoyable if you happen to be a basshead and you need wireless buds. Not off to a good start there, but there's actually a lot potential in these if Anker actually tries to grab the growing mobile audiophile market by the taint. Again, these are truly wireless in-ears so I'm not expecting much. Definitely on the bright side (hehe), these things got some pretty smooth highs and I think the mids are just... nice. Not too forward nor recessed for my tastes, and it's got a good amount of detail to it. Soundstage is the one thing that really impressed me on these buds. There's surprisingly a good amount of width for this form factor. Same opinion on the imaging as well, since it wasn't hard to tell the positioning of the instruments and different sounds in songs I've listened to. I mainly used these for music rather than calls, but as someone who doesn't call a lot, it's still noticeable that my calls were clear and any outside noise is reduced acceptably. By now, you can get a sense that these buds are not too shabby in the audio department. Maybe too pricy, but not too shabby. Depending on your ears, you could find these to be a lot of fun to listen to. I certainly never thought I hated the sound coming out of these. Comfort
My ears usually hates the fit of in-ears. These fit fine out of the box. There are a good amount of sizes for the tips and wings so I'm sure you'll most likely get them deep in there with the proper size. I usually bust a move when the music is playing and they don't fall out. I keep them in for probably an hour max each time for whatever activities I use them for, and they have yet to cause any pain. They protrude out of your ears in a not-so-attractive way though. Looking at myself in the mirror, they look like earplugs that aren't completely in my ear. At least they're smaller than I expected! Practicality
The earbuds hold a good charge and so does the case itself. I'm actually really thankful the case is compatible with wireless charging since it doesn't seem to be a common feature with earbud cases at the moment, even with the more expensive alternatives. It's a surprisingly nice quality-of-life feature that saves me the hassle of reaching for a cable. Packaging
I feel like they could ship me these buds in broken glass and toilet paper and I wouldn't care. But if you're on the search to add another one to your ever growing packaging collection, I like the material of the outer packaging. The box is colorful, has a good weight, and it's bigger than it needs to be,
Conclusion
For my total paid of $161.61, they're not bad. If you're looking for something that just sounds casually good and you're on the move, these will 99% get the job done with satisfaction for you. They sound substantially better than Airpods and they're not far off in price. Held a better connection for me in comparison as well. If you want something closer to the dream of reference grade wireless buds or you're trying to find a compact option to mix songs on the go, these aren't going to be it. Although I might be spoiled by headphones, these in-ears got me thinking that there's enough soundstage and imaging for bluetooth earbuds to eventually become a acceptable replacement for them. If Anker put some more time tuning the sound on these, they could dominate. But, I could probably say that with any of the numerous companies jumping on this TWS headset market right now. Until then, wait for a sale."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-20,The best sounding earbuds that I have ever had.,"I'm a fan of soundcore products and when I found out they were coming out with these ""in studio"" earphones, I had to jump on them as soon as they came out. I already own the Q20 over the ear headphones and the Liberty Neo earbuds as well as some other brands of bluetooth headphones from other makers so my review is based off of comparing to those. I'm an audiophile in the sense that I love great sounding music and I love hearing all the things in the background of the music like vocals, instruments, & effects and hearing these things makes me excited while listening to music. With that being said, I have to tell you that these are the best sounding headphones that I have ever had! You don't even need to have the volume on high to enjoy the sound quality of your songs. If you listen to streaming music then you might not notice any difference but if you listen to downloaded music to your phone or good quality mp3's then you will definitely notice how great they sound. I spent all day re-discovering some of my favorite albums and really enjoying them. You get engulfed in the sound. Cosmetically, I don't care for the way they look. They could have made them look better and not so akward looking. They are really comfortable though and don't hurt my ears like the Liberty Neo. They did take a few minutes to learn how to put them in my ears correctly. I didnt know you had to put them in your ears first and then twist them upward to ""lock"" them in place. That's a little weird but they work. The Souncore app allows you to reprogram the buttons so if you want to change one of them to control the volume, you can. I havn't had time to mess with the app much though but apparently you can set up the HearID so that you can custom the sound by your ears, making it sound even better. Overall, these headphones are great and if you are a music lover and love all aspects of a song and audio, these headphones are for you."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-10-20,Excellent with a couple of caveats,"I'm a very experienced in-ear headphone buyer/user, and I decided to give the Soundcore LP2 a go. I am not a purist re equalizer my gear, so after messing with the EQ on my iPhone 8+ (Kaiser Audio) I found the perfect settings for these buds. I also use Comply foam tips, and that's the only downside to these phones. The included ""wings"" hurt my ears where they rested after about 30 minutes. I removed them completely and the phones stay in place, but feel a bit, well, loose. I would not use them for exercise, but for walking, commuting etc., they are fine. Good at keeping ambient sound out. Bottom line, they are a very nice set of BT phones, maybe a bit more expensive than I would like, say they should be at $129 price point. I also have the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 BT phones, and I like them equally. Anyway, the LP2 are a very nice BT phone. I have owned Senn TWS and a couple other pair of $200+ BT in-ears and the LP2s equal them at a minimum."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-21,The sound of music,"Good:
-Holds a charge for a long time-up to 3 days plus for me. -Cool case-magnet will grab and charge the earbuds. -It took 3 times to find the fit for me but now the fit is perfect. -Sound quality is excellent. -Microphone works great. Receiving calls assume I am talking on the phone. Bad:
-Rare glitches with my iphone. I like these because of the comfort, sound quality and the fantastic charging. I use them all the time. This is an excellent set of earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-10-22,"Well worth the money. Sound great, fit great, best earbuds I own.","These sound great, fit great, and come packed with features. 32 hours battery life with the case, 8 hours on the earbuds alone, wireless charging capability, USB type-c, and the best bass I've experienced with earbuds. I use Sony's 1000XM3 over the ear headphones on a regular basis, but these are quickly becoming my traveling headphones. I use them everywhere- the office, the gym, going to bed, on a jog, etc. They stay in my ear well and come with an assortment of earbud sizes to make sure they give each person the sound isolation they need. Also these are $100 cheaper than the Powerbeats Pro and beat the Beats in every single facet. I can't recommend these enough."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-22,"Love them, much better than Liberty+, retired my Airpods","I was one of the disappointed Kickstarter backers for the original Liberty+. I'm not going to get into details; suffice to say here that they simply were not very good. I paid a bunch of money for them, and within weeks I'd given them away. They were so sketchy it made me a suspicious of the Anker brand. I think that the Liberty 2 is SO MUCH BETTER than the previous generation, and my Apple Airpods, for several reasons:
1. The Liberty 2 comes with lots of different choices in silicone tips. The medium didn't work for me, but one of the large sizes fits perfectly. And best of all, unlike the original Liberty+, none of the tips stop you from using the storage case. 2. Everyone knows that regular Airpods have zero sound isolation. Ordinary sounds - background noise on my commuter train, street noise in Chicago, etc. - forced me to surf a volume ranging from 75-90% ALL THE TIME just to hear quiet music passages and to understand audiobook dialog. The silicone tips on the Liberty 2 have a better seal and passively block nuisance sounds. I can use the Liberty 2 at only 25-50% volume and still enjoy better sound than the Airpods. 3. Comfortable fit. They don't cause discomfort even after long listening sessions, and they don't fall out. 4. The custom equalizer feature is dynamite. Turns out that after rock concerts and other abuse, my 50 year old ears don't have perfectly equal response to all sonic frequencies anymore. The app ran a short hearing test for both ears and set a persistent equalizer setting to counteract it. I didn't even consciously notice this issue until I ran the test, but afterwards the improvement was noticeable and very welcome. 5. Reliability on a par with the Airpods. I take the Liberty 2 buds out of the case, and BANG they're connected by bluetooth to each other and my phone. Every time. No dropouts, no weird sounds or signals. Long battery life for the buds, huge battery life . 6. Great material and feel. The earbuds are easy to pull out and insert. The case has a rounded but not glossy river-rock feel that's easy on the hand. The case door slides open and closed with a satisfying ""click"" sound that's reminiscent of the excellent Airpods case. Unreservedly recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-10-23,Pump Up the Volume!,"Wow! I have never used a pair of in ear headphones and these are a game changer! In the past I have occasionally used the wired headphones that came with my cell. But they are a bit awkward so I rarely bother. Then I got the chance to try the Anker Liberty 2 Pro headphones. How do you say work out game changer? I tucked these puppies in my ear and it was love at first note! Free of the wire I am dancing up a storm,
strutting to the music while I do chores and walking faster and longer! And I can put them in anytime and anywhere without disturbing anyone. The sound is crisp and clear. There is also an app you can use to select the way you like your music to sound. And accessories to choose from to customize the fit. The case is sleek and compact. The one drawback was set up was a little unclear and I had to go online to use the manual. Overall, I love the earphones and they have me moving and grooving. And that’s a good thing!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-10-23,Hurts with extended use,"I want to start off by saying that these sound pretty great. The app is required to alter preset EQ's and I found it lacking, but after chosing the flat curve I was able to uninstall the app completely. Comfort-wise is a mixed bag. There are many different options for tips and wings and they seem like good quality. Unfortunately, I found these to become fairly painful in the ear after maybe an hour or two. There is relatively a lot of weight hanging out your ear, putting pressure inside you canal where it grips. These would probably have been better off including some sort of over ear clip. Looking forward to what Anker does with this technology in the future!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-10-25,Great sounding wireless ear buds that fit well,"The Good:
-Excellent sound (lows and highs and good bass)
-Nice fit since it comes with so many ear adapters
-Easy to use and pair
-Long lasting battery
-Charging case
-iOS app is well baked out
The Bad:
-Microphone for some reason doesn’t that great to other parties
The Bottom Line:
I really like these Anker wireless earbuds for their comfort and sound quality. The sound is excellent for all ranges of music. It comes with many ear attachments so you should be able to find one that fits. The battery life is very good and you can charge with the case. The only downside that I see is that when I make calls, some people think I sound monotone. I don’t know if it’s the noise reduction technology or what. Overall, I would still recommend these wireless earbuds as they are one of the best sounding ones I have tried. *If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below! **Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-10-26,Big bass,The sound quality is very comparable to the Sony wf-1000xm3 but with much more bass available thanks to the extra drivers.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-10-28,Very to set up for beginners. Great sound for non-audiophile.,"Very easy to set up and get going! I'm new to the true wireless headphones, but I know Anker/Soundcore has some quality products so I got these. It took me about 30 seconds to pair with my phone and I was very pleased with the sounds, and especially the bass. I've use it mainly during work and it fits my ear pretty well, but I haven't tried it while running or exercising. I've been wearing this for 2 hours at a time without any discomfort so I can see myself wearing them for even longer. I don't know the exact specs of the battery, but it easily lasts me a few days without recharging. Overall, this is a great product and I'm glad I bought this."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-02,I really wannted to like these,"The title speaks for itself. These earbuds are good but have two major issues that cannot be avoided
1. The random static after you pause a video or movie gets annoying. You can even hear it sometimes while resuming media
2. The battery on the left side of the ear buds is apparently where its all at. The right side of the ear buds will deplete at the same time the left still has at least 30%-40% of charge left. Originally i thought it was a defective pair the first time so i returned ans replaced it. The same issue with the second pair. The static i hope will be removed overtime with software updates. The battery needs imo quality control fixes. So far the only pair of wireless ear buds that seems to come close to my expectations and is the galaxy buds from samsung."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-03,Close to the top,"I bought this set because I needed a set that was better for being heard in phone calls while having good sound when listening to music. The microphone is adequate, but not great and found these to be a very good pair, the sound is more than decent; though the personalized equalizer is worthless, the sound is richer and broader without it. The battery life appears good I have not used them long enough to have a definitive assessment. The buttons work very ell and are easy to use; the volume has to be controlled through the device. The ear piece is comfortable and snug, though I had to use the larger tips, when I usually use the medium. The noise reduction is a little better than that from regular buds. The set can connect through a proprietary device app, which has the additional features. There is no indication that the set is water resistant. I have had a set of TOZO buds that are excellent in sound, are water resistant, but not very good for phonecalls, and are very inexpensive, comparatively."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2019-11-03,"Buggy headphones, do not buy.","Do not recommend these headphones at all. The sound is pretty good, but they simply do not work well. I use these for work, and voice calls on my laptop randomly will break and turn into static so my only option is to not use them for that. After a couple weeks of using them paired with my phone they randomly stopped connecting to both headphones at the same time. I could either play music out of the left headphone or the right one but not both. I had reset them and nothing seemed to fix it. Something is off with these headphones, so if you’re going to buy these expect to have similar problems."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2019-11-04,Original pair defective,Waiting for new pair original defective
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-04,Raining on Sony's parade,"I have this and Sony's WF-1000XM3. As the first wireless ANC headphones, the Sony's sets a high bar. The Sony's aren't really for exercise as it doesn't have an IPX rating and only use the tips for retention. This is why I wanted to use other earphones. Sony's sport version doesn't doesn't get a lot of reviewer's love. Sony's silicon tips don't isolate sound very well, I'd use the included foam ones. Sony's ANC has a lighter hiss than Soundcore. The first set of Soundcores actually had a heavy hiss and couldn't update the firmware. Anker quickly replaced them with a patched set. I don't expect a company to have zero flaws in production, but a willingness to correct a wrong. And they made it very easy. With Liberty's flat EQ, the bass has much more weight than the Sony's flat setting. For me a good flat setting is what I want in earphones I use with a phone, because I will use it for things other than music without messing with EQs. Liberty's flat for me is still more for music, than general use earphone. Sony's ANC has many options, which Soundcore really only has call noise suppression. Sony's will be better for work and travel with ANC, ANC settings and more volume levels. At well below $200 range the Liberty Pro 2 earphones and Amazon, which I have not tried, but read good things about really dampen Sony's high priced WF-1000XM3 reign as the only wireless in ears with ANC with more affordable options."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-04,My absolute favorite headphones!,"First off, I’m not a sound engineer or a music producer. And I’m certainly not one of the 10 Grammy winning artists that have supported these headphones. But what I am is a music and headphone lover. I’ve had many, many different types of headphones over the years and these, by far, blow every single pair of them away. They sound awesome, the noise cancelation is awesome, the battery life is awesome...even the app is awesome! I work in a very loud lumber mill and I’ve always struggled to find headphones that are loud enough, and have enough noise cancellation to drown out all the loud noises at work. The only ones that come close are the Bose QC 35’s. I’d go so far as to say, these are better than the Bose headphones. I also love bass. I like to feel my head rattle when the bass drops....these make my head rattle. But the highs are crystal clear as well. I don’t know how Anker did it, but they’ve won me over! Best $150 I’ve ever spent. Way. To. Go. Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-04,You get more then what you expect. *Edit(12/18/19),"First off there is a try in the noise cancellation area. *Edit(something was mentioned about about gain being too high creating the static sound) But, this doesn't come with noise cancellation. But with loud enough background noise the static will come in loud and clear found that out a few days ago. The update has removed some of the noise is most situations. I notice it from time to time with out looking for it, is this a deal breaker for me no. *Edit ( so the static comes and goes with applications turning off and on and sat and nitpicked it, again not a deal breaker for me)
Where I work has metal shavings and dust, the charger and headset tend to attract this so I do have issues here and there charging but they usually go away with cleaning. I usually get about 8 and half hours off the headset, talking greatly kills the battery of the right side as its the primary side for talking if both headsets are in use. *Edit( After updates and what not my headset life sits right about 7~6.5 hours. This does include calls and listening to movies/music. These guys stay in my ear all day for the most part. Ok, those updates. It's a master and slave Bluetooth setup, your main linked earbud will loose power alot faster then the other earbud. It's freaky looking at it in the app, you got one fully charged earbud the other is 3/4 dead. The button isn't bad, can't really use it while moving might knock the ear bud out. After you program it to the way you want it's quiet useful or you can leave it alone. I mainly use my phone to control volume and songs playlist, so again something that's doesn't really bother me. *Edit( I find I only reach for the button to turn off music and advance the track on my right ear, if you decide to get used to placement it's not a bad fit)
That's it for the bad. The good. Bass is clear and crisp no distortion. Play with the equalizer from the soundcore app, it truly makes this headset come alive, it has been a joy to listen to these just as much as the powerbeat pros I had, just a lot cheaper
I have a weird combo with the ear wings and buds but I have found a set that work well without ear fatigue or hurting after 4 plus hours in my ear. You have go through alot of trial and error to get it right if you don't get the perfect fit right off the bat. Talking after the update, I was told I have become much clearer and it's easier to talk to people on my headset. *Edit(refer to paragraph above about battery, fit again, play with sizes, your ears are gonna hurt until you get the right size. Ok, sound. These are not the bad ass over the ear audiophile head phones you see people comparing it too. These have to be compared to other in ear earbuds, still these sound amazing. Bass is deep/clear, tremble/mids on point, highs ok, sometimes they can sneak in there. The app you are playing from has alot to do with what/how you hear. I use Amazon music and vlc. Amazon usually plays really good, until I have a app error and I own the worst headset every created, I think I mentioned the highs. The vlc works ok but unless I format my music proper, it's pretty flat. I decided to try out some complaints about sound from others and my only thoughts were everybody has different standards for listening.) Overall this has been a excellent headset and am I glad I made the jump before they came out. *Edit( these suckers are 109.99 right now, if your lucky and see a coupon on here you can get them even cheaper. I have since purchased 4 pairs of these headsets and and gifted 3 after a small learning curve this headset has been the headset of choice for my friends. Also they block alot of outside noise when fitted propperly. You can pretend to ignore your significant other with these in. But you have to show them how well they insulate noise to prove your point.)"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-04,Almost great,They are incredibly comfortable and sound great but white noise in background is too annoying. Returning unless they can be resolved via software update.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-05,After a Week of Use I Love These,"Tip: Experiment with the different wing tips and ear buds for the best seal and fit. Make sure the wing tip goes into the crevice of your ear (as shown in my photo). Otherwise the fit will be lose and you won't get the best out of these. Fit is important. Take the time to figure the best out for yourself. The only thing I don't like about these ear buds is there's no option for noise cancellation and there's no way to control the volume through the ear buds themselves unless you change the control of the phsyical button. Which would be for pause/skipping anyway. What I do love is the app, the equalizer is great. Soundcore Signature and Piano presents sound the best to me. After you figure out the right wing tip + ear bud combo for your ears you forget they're in your ears. The case is great. Very pocketable. The tips fall into place magnetically. Ear buds will automatically turn on and off when you place them in or take them out of the case. As long as you have bluetooth on your device they'll automatically pair. The bluetooth reception is awesome. I live in a duplex. Sat my phone on my kitchen table, went into the bathroom about 15 meters away through three or four different walls. Never had a skip. Other bluetooth devices I have struggle with this. Battery life is a solid 8 hours. If you can deal with 80% volume you can probably get 9 hours out of them. You can use the ear buds as a single bud as the other one charges. Phone calls are solid. Only struggles slightly in noisy situations like a restaurant with a lot of voices or something of that sort."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-05,thoughts on liberty pro 2,Received in exchange for a honest review. The sound is crisp and clear. They are easy to setup and the hearID is awesome to get them customized more to you. I love the options you have to put on the earphones to have them fit your ear. I connected them to my phone via the app and my kindle found them easily as well. Audiobooks sound great in these earphones. Next is mycomputer to use working online because I think the clear crispness of the sound will be better for work. I didn't hear anything when having these on but the music so worked great at cancelling things out around me. My only issue was I couldn't go far from the source not sure if it was because of the source and where it was but it didn't go a great distance before having a issue. Other than this they worked great. Good sound quality. Easy to setup and use and excellent battery life and noise cancellation.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-05,"Fantastic Sound Quality, Acceptable Features","I pre-ordered these from the Anker site with a coupon code from Linus Tech Tips so I got them for about 2/3 the price here on Amazon. I also own both IconX and a pair of Galaxy Buds that will be my point of reference. I am not an audiophile so that's not my angle here. I'm just a guy who enjoys music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Most of the music I listen to is heavy in the bass department so I appreciate when my headphones/buds reflect that. Hopefully that informs you on whether my review is relevant to you or not. Packaging:
They came in a super-nice packaging with a textured, kind of rugged feeling box. It was definitely different than the sleek, smooth, Apple-inspired boxes I'm used to these days. The packaging felt very solid. On the inside of the cover you'll find a diagram describing the dual-driver configuration of the buds and a plastic cover over the charging case and buds. Below that insert is an assortment of replacement tips and wings as well as an anker USB-C to USB-A cable. Of course you'll also find the usual Quick Start guide, etc.
Design:
I do quite like the way the buds themselves look. I prefer the more compact design of the Galaxy Buds but the Soundcores are not really larger, just more oblong. Each bud has a single button along the top rather than capacitive touch controls. The charging case is about twice as large as the charging case for the Galaxy Buds. It has a sliding top that feels very solid. Three lights on the front indicate the amount of battery left. There is a button on the back that can reset the buds when they are closed in the case. Fit:
Unlike my Samsungs these fit me right out of the box. I usually have to switch to smaller tips but not so with these. They fit in my ears securely and have yet to feel like they are close to falling out. I don't do any jogging or biking but I do spend a decent amount of time walking around and exercising in the gym. Setup:
Setup is dead simple but I did have some issues. You download the app, turn on the buds, and select them from your bluetooth menu. I had a problem with my left bud refusing to connect. It took me about 10 minutes to find that I had to replace them into the charging case and close the lid. After that I had to hold the reset button to completely reset the buds. Then when I paired them up everything was fine. The App:
The app is very nice looking and very simple. You have to have both buds connected to use the app so keep that in mind. Within the app you have basically two options - set your EQ and customize the buttons. There are a wide variety of presets for the EQ but no custom EQ. There is also a feature called HearID that plays tones of different frequencies to customize the EQ to your hearing. I could definitely notice a difference and this is the option that I use. As for the controls your options are pretty limited. You have a short, long, and double-press for each of the buttons. Only long and double-press can be customized to either next/previous, voice assistant, and volume +/-. Functionality:
The biggest thing I miss from the buds is Ambient Sound mode. I use it all the time and for that reason I think I'll probably continue to use the Galaxy Buds in certain situations. Not having a custom EQ is kind of disappointing but not huge for me. I'm sure for audiophiles it's a much bigger deal. So far I've not had any issues with the sound cutting out, erroneous button presses, or anything of that nature. No noise-cancelling either. Feature-wise they are pretty bare-bones so something to be aware of. Battery Life:
I've only had them for two days so I haven't really had a chance to put them through their paces but so far so good. I've used them for a few hours each day and haven't charged the case at all. So far everything is still showing high charge. Things have come a long way since my first gen IconX died in about an hour lol. I'll update my review if I need to later. Sound:
Last but certainly not least is sound. For me this is where they really shine. The mids and highs sound really great and clear. I haven't heard any static or distortion. What was really surprising to me is the amount of bass you get. The dual-driver design appears to not just be a gimmick. I get far more bass from these buds than I do from my Galaxy Buds or the IconX before them. They sound equally as good with an audiobook or podcast. You do get a little more bass in voices but it's not overpowering. I've seen mention in other reviews of static at low volumes or after pausing and I've had none of that so I can't speak to it. Overall I am very happy with these earbuds. They are comfortable and have great battery life. While they may not be the most feature-packed they definitely have the sound profile that I'm looking for and sound great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-05,Yes! Just yes!,"There are no other words to say but WOW !! Just freaking WOW !! Aside from a passthrough mode or transparency mode or ambient mode,... these are beyond perfect. Sound - phenomenal
Fit - phenomenal
Comfort - phenomenal
Call/mic quality - phenomenal
I've been through about 10 pair of true wireless head phones trying to find the right one,... and these are it!!! I'm in love and you will fall in love with these as well. I'm keeping these and my search is finally over until an updated version comes out! Great job Soundcore!👏👏👏"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-05,Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro Ear Buds.... real competition for Bose and Apple!,"First off, the sound quality is excellent on these (to my ears). Very good bass, clean with good separation. Sound has an open feeling... it's like comparing a single speaker to a good quality multi driver speaker system. Very good. Construction is very nice. Plastic is very high quality, nicer than Apple or Bose in my opinion. The earbuds automatically paired to my Mac and iPhone when I took them out of their case. Very easy. the case is also the charger. It contains another battery so you can charge the earbuds 2 or three times from the case. The case connects to a USB ports or USB charger to charge. There are lights on the case to show the status of the cases charge. The case is very nicely made and small. The ear buds come with different buds and wings to enable you to customize the fit. I had to switch the buds to a smaller size and they fit well, very comfortable. These compare very favorably with my Bose ! All in all, I'm very happy with these !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2019-11-06,Almost nailed it but a couple of major flaws hold it back.,I've owned several of different wireless earbuds and have found all of them lacking in one way or another. These almost have it nailed down though. They stay in my ear without falling out so that is a plus. All the others that I have had it didn't take long before I lost one of the buds. These do stay firmly in place. When I listen to music these sound great when the volume is turned up. At low volumes though there is a constant static. I don't think this would be a deal breaker for most people. I mostly listen to audio books though. No matter what the volume I have the earbuds at I can still hear the static. I am hoping this can be fixed in a software update. I will update this review if that happens. It takes a few tries to memorize where the buttons are and how they work but once you do it becomes 2nd nature. That has been an issue on other earbuds for me. When making a call I can hear the caller on my end just fine. The person I'm talking to doesn't have any trouble hearing me but they say I sound like I am to far away from the speakerphone. These almost have it but I can't really recommend them at this price point.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-06,Great but not worth the extra $50 for a $5 wireless charging pad. The non-pro model sounds identical,"Great but not worth the extra $50 for a $5 wireless charging pad. The non-pro model sounds identical. Pros:
- Good sound... Personally I would have liked the 'Electronic' EQ setting as default out of the box but no biggie. - Comfortable and stayed in my ears really well. Better than any other earbuds that I tried. - Wireless charging. Cons:
- Overpriced. Paying $50 over the identical sounding non-pro model is not worth it. - Case feels a bit bulky in your pocket."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-06,High quality acoustics,"These in-ear buds are beautifully presented in magnetic closure packaging with a textured design that feels great in hand when opening. The charging case for the buds has a soft silicone feel on the outside but the inside has relatively cheap feeling plastic for the bed. I would have preferred a little more quality there than in the outer packaging but overall, the case is still sleek and well designed. It easily slides open and closed. The buds come with a total of 7 differently sized silicone eartips and 3 earwings which can provide a custom fit for almost any ear. When you find a perfect fit, it should cancel much of the ambient noise though not as much as some of the can style headphones. I was fairly impressed with the snug fit and noise cancellation for being earbuds. I have other anker buds and also have tried several jabra styles both buds and cans. These don't cancel all outside noise, but remember these are earbuds. Again, there are plenty of silicone eartips so you can get as close as possible to complete noise cancellation. You will need to download the app but you don't need an account. You need to allow the app permissions to: 1) make and manage phone calls, and 2) access location. I did not create an account to use with these. I was able to connect very quickly to my Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone but not to my Chromebook. In all fairness, my Chromebook may be the culprit but it is still kind of a pain to not be able to simply connect via wifi or bluetooth instead of going through an app.
The app allows you to really customize your listening experience based on what you are listening to and what you enjoy. The sound is crisp and clear with tight, powerful base and I couldn't detect any hissing or static, at all. The acoustics and stereo sound like high end can style headphones. The buds work great and I was surprised by the range. Usually, I cannot put a lot of space between my bluetooth earbuds or headphones without disruption. With these, I was able to leave my phone and walk around the house and even upstairs without any connectivity issues at all. My husband even called me on the phone because I couldn't hear him calling me with the earbuds in and I was able to take his call through these while I was on a different floor from my phone. Phone calls are very clear on both ends. I like that you can customize the button functions on the buds. I prefer the buttons to the touch pad style since I am constantly touching the buds accidentally. There is one small button on each bud which you can program. I don't need a lot of different commands so this works well and you can program each earbud with separate commands. The charging case can be charged on a Qi certified charger which is convenient and saves me from pulling out yet another charging cable. Perfectly giftable. Overall, I would say that these are a high 4 stars. Not perfect, but great for wireless earbuds and they have tremendous range as well as outstanding acoustics. They are still a bit pricey at the current retail of around $150 but worth it for the quality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-06,Updated: Best customer support. Period.,"Updated review after contact with Customer Support. The CS for this company is simply excellent - They sent me different iterations of the product, reviewed the problem with me in detail and finally delivered on the product they support. I can confirm that the hissing is gone (While there is still a minimal static present; is no different to almost all wireless headphones) and the product is absolutely great. Thanks Anker, great job on this one. Old Review
""The quality of these earbuds its great - excellently built, comfortable, sound great... but there is a relentless white noise, way too loud in the background. I have contacted Anker directly 24 hours ago, as this is the second pair with the same problem, they have not replied yet, but I did read from them that this could be part of a 1% with the (now) known hardware defect. It does seem like a stretch however that 1% of the universe is affected and I got 2 with the same problem in a row. Regardless - either wait for a second version or stay away from these."""
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-07,Great ear-buds. Would benefit from Pass-Thru audio,"I've had a pair of these, and a pair of Liberty 2 now for about 2 weeks and I would recommend them. Truly there aren't a lot of differences between the Liberty 2 and these, except Qi Charging and supposedly a different driver for the MIds in the Pros. Soundwise, I don't notice the different drivers. Obviously not having wireless charging in the case is noticeable, but the battery life lasts me a full workday on a single charge
Things I like about these:
- Easy to use & Pair. My wife is not a techy person and she even mentioned how easy these were to set up on her phone. - Fit!!! Again about my wife, she has tiny ears. So finding earbuds that fit her well is DIFFICULT. Plus she's a runner, so fit is important. With the 3 different wing sizes & 3 earbud sizes, she was able to get these to be secure during a run. - The sound space is great on these. Currently, I'm listening to Blake Shelton and I can almost see the band placement on stage. - Dual Master: Both the Left & the Right earbud can be used on its own. Neutral:
Sound isolation. Anyone who uses earbuds at work knows that sound isolation can be both important and a detriment. These have great sound isolation to block ou those annoying coworkers. However, they're TOO good so if you're a runner you can't be aware of your surroundings. Overall: For $150 I think Liberty Pro 2 is a great option, but for the price point I'd like to see the addition of pass-thru audio option."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-09,NOISY AND HYPED HIGH END,Know before you buy that there is a common problem with these and despite Soundcore saying it's 1% of customers clearly that's not the case. These have a very high noise floor (constant white noise) but what makes it annoying is when you stop playing audio after a few seconds I'm assuming the amps go into standby and kill the noise. I'm on my second pair and was really bummed these have the same problem. Seriously QC your products and stop shipping the ones with issues!! ALSO these have a very hyped high end. It's like ice pick piercing cymbals and none of the eq presets do anything to help. Speaking of the EQ settings they are all trash. The flat profile is far from it. The others are so drastic no one who has any clue what music should sound like would use them. You might be thinking what does this guy know? I've been a recording engineer for 10 years and the only way these sound anything like I thought they should is by using the flat EQ profile and then lowering the high end in the 8khz and up range using the EQ on my note 9.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-10,Sound great but right bud is not right... *SEE UPDATE*,"I got mine two days ago. I was blown away at how great they sounded. They worked great for about an hour and a half. Now they won't connect to each other. The first picture below is when I try to reset them. The left bud resets just fine (blinks red three times), but the right doesn't. With the buds turned off, a one second press-and-hold of the button is supposed to turn them on and have make them connect to each other. The left bud turns on and the LED goes to the ""breathing"" state which means it's trying to connect to the right bud, but the right bud automatically goes into fast blinking Bluetooth pairing mode. The right bud is also making a high pitched squealing noise that is very faint while it is turned on. The squealing continues for about five seconds after the right but is powered off. Again, the left bud doesn't do this at all. I'm going to get them replaced. Hopefully the replacements work because I really did love their sound. UPDATE:
I ordered another pair, and returned the bad pair. The replacement came yesterday and I'm very happy with them so far. They sound great and most importantly, they are still functioning properly after a full days use. I upgraded from a pair of Soundcore Spirit X earphones which sounded fine, but during my workouts, I had to readjust them after every set. This morning with the Liberty 2 Pro, I found myself reaching up as a matter of habit, but they didn't need to be readjusted. I do have a few complaints. First, I like all of the default equalizers, but I would give them all up for user defined custom EQ. Second, the HearID test could be better. I'm sure they had to make it ""user friendly"" so a five minute test per ear was out of the question, but I wish it was at least an option for those of us willing to go through the hassle for more accurate results. Second, a mode that provides audio pass-through would be a great addition. Last, there is an audible hissing that others have described. I hear it when the headphones first connect but haven't started playing audio yet (not a big deal to me). I'm not going to hold my breath, but three of these four could be addressed with a firmware/app update. Overall, these are great earbuds for the price. I am very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-11,Very pleasantly- amazed actually,"Full disclosure: I was sent this product after I purchased the Soundcore Life P2 and left middling review. Anker's customer service is over the top. Ok, I have a background in live audio engineering and film/video production (way back when), so I have a bit of a thing for headphones. My wife buys boots. I buy headphones. My baseline headphones have been the Shure SE215; decent entry level in ear monitors and they fit under motorcycle helmets. These are as good as the Shure SE215 which retail for about the same price point. Bonus for the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro is these are wireless! These have pretty remarkable instrument separation that I'm betting is a benefit of the hybrid driver set up (a regular cone and a balanced armature). After the bits break in a bit, these will be even warmer. Plus the accompanying app has an EQ to fine tune them more. I haven't used it yet. Didn't see a need. So far the fit is good. They have the loop to fix them in place which keeps the ear piece seated better and helps with sound isolation. Great headphones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-12,"Pretty good, but constant weird white noise issue is present.","Decent for the price point. Great fit, above average sound quality, and they even come with an app. Only problem is the mic gain is set way too high. Only wireless head set i own that has this issue."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-12,Edit of previous highly negative negative review. Please read.,"I have now had my Liberty 2 earbuds for 6 months & am still absolutely astonished at the quality & I've never been happier with a purchase. I have a pair of Raycon E50's which are decent but they are bass heavy & muffle midrange. Copared to the new Sony earbuds, these Soundcore buds are amazing. Th fidelity and depth of sound is truly midblowing. Thy are well wirth the price, especially now that the price has dropped. An audiophile's dream at an incredibly affordable price. Editd on 11/15/2019 - I received an email from Anker/Suncore apologizing for my experience with their product. They are processing a refund for fidlity of these amazing earbuds. Anker & Souncore absolutely stand by their prduct & I've ever been happier with a purchasethe Liberty 2 Pro buds & allowingme to keep them to regift. Theey've also offered me another new product with an earhook which might serve to fit me. I am therefore changing my original ONE STAR Review to 5 stars. It took a bit of work but Anker really came through & made sure I was satisfied. Thank you Shane at Anker, and thank you Anker/Soundcore. This is my original review:
I bought mine directly from Anker/Souncore & paid $179.00, premium price. I was very unhappy with the fit, tried a variety of tips & ear fittings but couldn't get a proper fit. Anker stated a 30 day ""no questions asked"" satisfaction return but when I tried to get a refund I have been barraged with emails telling me to detail what I've tried & explain to the detail what didn't work. Each response is met with another email challenging my dissatisfaction. I have bought nearly $1000 worth of Anker producrs before. Crds, wall outlets, Charging Banks. To be treated with such disregard by a company I once trusted is abhorrent & insulting to me. I am very unhappy with Anker's Custormer Servie & have no trust that they will honor their stated warranties. The serial number for my Liberty Pro 2 is: ACJSSH. Anker: Make good on your guarantees."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-12,"Incredible sound, stable fit.","After trying several earbuds in the $50 range, including the Life P2s, I bought these and they address every issue I had with the other ones. The sound is incredible, bass is clean and plentiful, and mids and highs are all clear. I've also worked out with them and they did not get loose during the workout. The buttons are also programmable to adjust volume, skip tracks, or summon your smart assistant. I made a couple of calls with them and had no complaints. The case has 3 leds providing the case's charge status. The liberty 2 Pro checked off everything I wanted in earbuds so I stopped looking."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-13,Updated 12/11/2019,"Changed my rating from three stars to 5
So I think its safe to sate Anker has the best customer service, I had a issue with my unit and Anker made it right and went above and beyond in the meantime. my new set of buds sound amazing. I recently purchased
the new Sony Wf- series ear buds and returned them because I feel these have a better sound signature. I'd recommend these to any one who wants a great pair of everyday ear buds. These are great for the office or even a commuter. Pros:
1. Great sound signature
2. App integration
3. They get LOUD
4. presentation
5. Lots of ear tips and wings for customization. 6. Price point
Cons:
1. Case gets really worm when wireless charging (not a huge issue) but worth mentioning. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
PREVIOUS ISSUE
There was an annoying hissing sound in the earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-13,Loving these new earbuds!,"I bought the original Liberty+ earbuds a couple of years ago, and have loved most of them. But, I could never get them to sit quite right in my ears, and they would just fall out. These new earbuds lock into my ears just about perfectly. I haven't gone more than an hour at a time yet with them, but the comfort for the time that I have used them has been really good. I've only had mine for a month, but so far the battery life and performance has been really good. The connectivity has been about as close to flawless as I could expect, so that's a good plus. Overall, these get a buy rating from me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-14,"Great desing, goood sound if you can drown the hissing.","They sound good and the design is amazing. I can't get over the loud hissing that drowns my music at low volumes. this is bad because I like my music to act as background noise, so I listen to low volume. In some songs the hissing drowns the music. Listening to metal it's not too noticeable (but there), but listening to classical music on these is hard, the hiss overpowers a lot of the soft winds and strings. Please fix this issue if possible."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-14,These are the earbuds to buy won't be disappointed.,Best tws for the money no need spend 300 dollars
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-14,Average dudes opinion,"Overview: price vs features beats most if not all other brands
This headset is one of my first true wireless versions and I can honestly say its been one of the best out of the other headsets I have. In fact its been so good it made me break my hatred of making reviews. Pros:
-Battery life 8 hours per earbud with a Qi-wireless charging case that adds more time (nuff said)
-portability is quite nice with the case after adjusting for a few days. -Sound quality has a great range for all three (highs, mids, lows) I'm not going to call it sex in the ear but it's really good. -Wireless charging I'll be honest this feature helps with charging set it in the same place every night and your good to go. Now for the bad
Cons:
-portability again its a split deal for me the size can be a little weird coming from someone who's never had a case before. its different as I'm used to a neck band. (Lost it a few times)
-sound quality anker is pushing this as sex in the ear by using artists for quality checks. While its awesome its not sex in the ears out of the box playing with eq will as each person has different tastes. For the price and build quality I would buy it again and recommend it. I find the battery life amazing. While I do not own other wireless earbuds I find that the features vs price for this cannot be compaired. (As of yet)"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-14,A great pair of headphones that won't work for everyone,"I was beyond excited when I pre-ordered the Liberty 2 Pro earphones (at the early adopter price of $109). The sound stage is excellent. The bass is lovely and not too overdone. The button placement on top of the earbud is a great idea and works well. I never had an issue with the earbuds falling out, even when doing floor work at the gym. What caused me to return the headphones was the sad fact that I could not produce a seal in my ear, even after trying every single ear tip and wing combination. The sound is drastically weakened because I could not make a seal, and I could remove the earbuds with ease. For some people, this may be a plus, but for me, they feel more like AirPods, in the way that they just *sit* gently. I tend to want to wedge earbuds deeply. Again, maybe the lack of a deep plunge will be great for some. Overall, I would highly recommend the Liberty 2 Pro for their sound, but I suggest trying the headphones for fit."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-14,"Great sound, fit, battery and style.","Love these earbuds over all I prefer them over sony, sanhitiser and boss I have them sitting on the table dont usethem anymore . My liberty pro 2 has no background static or hissing not soever I bought it just to give it a try it turnd out a bargain, love it will pre order the next generation when they make it!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-15,Natural response at a great price.,"Ill keep it simple. For the price, you are getting great earbuds with true Stereo image. I listen to orchestral music (modern cinematic music) and and I know these compositions very much in how they should sound. You are not gonna get the best in ear phones, but that is fair. These headphones are sold at a fraction of the price of the new apple ones and they sound great. If you are looking for a NATURAL representation for the music that you love. These are great. No frequency bandwidth is overpowering each other, which is exactly what I like. If you want the bass to be more pronounced or deep, these are not your best headphones put there. If you are a music produder and you want tp use these as a secondary reference for i. Ear phone experience of the mix, use these as they will only EQ the mix naturally according to the nature of the form factor and only slightly with the soundcore app which you can turn off if desired. The only reason im giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because im hoping Anker feels encouraged to keep making products like these, and imrpove whayever flaws this one might have, as Im sure there is a growing market for users like me that are more on the side of listrning a record as it would sound in the studio. Overall. Great in ear headphones with a natural frequency response at a great price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-15,Finally Wireless Buds With ALL Features Included... At ONLY $150!,"For the last year I have experienced many ""what could be moments"" with true wireless buds. My journey began with Samsung buds that sadly had trouble after 3 months. Those buds let me listen to either bud while the other charged. As I looked to replace these I quickly discovered how difficult this feature is to find. I tried various brands and found that it was almost impossible to find every feature available on one single brand. After trying many of the expensive brands including Bose I settled on the Anker Soundcore Liberty buds and loved them but once again not all features were included. I came across these and finally found everything I wanted from wireless buds were here. These exceeded the reviews I read even the hyped up reviews. Here is what I have found so far. * Can listen to one bud at a time while the other charges. When you place an ear piece back into the unit the remaining bud re-connects to your device. This is automatic but may pause your music. * Long battery life!!! (8 hours claimed) I have only had these 1 day so have not tested this yet but my previous soundcore liberties got the claimed 6 hours which I tested multiple times. * Sound Quality. WOW is all I can say here. I saw the reviews about how good the sound was but felt skeptical. As soon as I put these in I was amazed at how great the sound was. I used the app to customize the EQ to my ears and while I didn't notice a ton of difference (they already sounded outstanding) it is pretty cool and does sound incredible. * Comfort. Again WOW. These are fairly large (larger they my Liberties) but feel much lighter and are incredibly comfortable. I put them in my ear and they are so comfortable that I almost forget they are there. My Liberties while comfortable did not feel anything like these do. Of all the buds I have tried these are by far the most comfortable I have tried. * Case. I saw reviews about how big this case is. Again comparing to my Liberties the case is overall about the same size but its shape is WAY more comfortable in my pocket. I believe it is due to it being less tall so that it does not feel as bulky in my Jeans pocket (I keep them in my front pocket). The case is also really cool how it opens and closes and while this is not really relevant to why to buy it is still very cool and feels very modern. Overall this is one of my favorite purchases I have made in a long time in tech gear. I have finally found buds that do it all and do it all very well. And then you look at the price. I got them discounted to $110 but after my experience I would have been more than happy to have these at their regular price of $150."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-15,Lots to Like but i got the hiss,"There's a lot to like about these wireless ear buds. Pros:
Sound - They sound great and continue to impress the more i listen. Get that seal. They have an EQ App for customization. Pairing - Easy to pair and very quick to boot. Buds can be used separately. Case - USB C charging and very small for large buds. Cons:
White Noise - a noticeable hissing noise that's more apparent when listening to podcast. uh oh...I read that this is limited to 1% of units and they are fixing the issue. I kind of helps with ambient noise and overall, not too bad when music is playing. When in a quiet setting, it hard to unhear it and i listen to a lot of podcast. Minor:
Large Buds - they are fairly big but considering the sound coming from these, it's understandable. would prefer a flatter profile. Fit - I think my ears aren't normal. Can't really fault Anker...they do provide a wide range of tips and wings. Can't wear them for too long due to fatigue. Will continue to try different combinations."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-15,Sublime,"The sound on these is sublime. I didn’t think I would say this, but I don’t feel the need to turn to my wired headphones to enjoy music anymore. Anker have done a wonderful job here. Bravo. The low end is a joy. Separation is great. Battery life very good. Comfort is subjective, but I wear them for hours and have no issues. Noise isolation is acceptable, but not the best. Will try some foam tips and see how that goes."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-16,Get the App.,Listening to music sounds great and I love it!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-17,Love these earbuds!,"This is my second pair of earbuds -- the first wouldn't work correctly and were donated to a friend with a more comparable phone. Given my first experience I was hesitant to try these, but I am so glad I did! These earbuds paired effortlessly with my phone (Moto E4), my dell computer and a chromebook. Understandably, you can only pair to one device at a time, otherwise how would it know what to play. There were 7 different eartips and 3 earwings so they can be perfectly customized to fit your ear. The earwing twists back to ""lock"" the earbud into your ear and to my surprise they do a great job holding them in. I was able to run, jump, and hold my head to the side without the earbuds falling out. The sound was good enough for me. I am sure if you are an audiophile you would not be pleased, but these are as good or better than any of my corded headphones. I feel they are better at speech/movies than music. Noise cancelling works well, I can still hear some background noise but can't really tell what is being said to me when they are in and someone talks, so they do the job. Removing the earbuds from the charging case turns them on, putting them back in turns them off. The lid of the case open and closes easily without coming open unintentionally or when tossed in a bag or purse. The magnetic charging port makes lining them up simple. I really like that you can chose to use one or both of the earbuds. So if I want to listen to something but still want to pay attention to my surroundings I can. I am not convinced the HearID is a great addition. Before using it, my left earbud was distinctly quieter than my right, making the sound off balance. After testing it came back that the setting was perfect and the left earbud still seems quieter comparatively. I have yet to completely discharge these earbuds. The case gives three additional fast charges (10 minutes of charging gives you 2 hours according to the documentation). The buttons on the earbuds are defaulted but can be customized with the ap. I played a little and then reset them, preferring the factory manufacture settings."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-17,HearID personalization is the real deal...it rocks!,"I’ve had these earbuds for 2 days now, and I can honestly say they absolutely rock! Because I have significant hearing loss between 4kHz and 8kHz, most earbuds sound only okay, as I’m not able to enjoy the crisp highs that others enjoy...resulting in a kind of dull overall sound. After using HearID to tune each earbud to my respective ear, it was like I had been blind and can now see. I’m hearing detail in my songs that I never knew existed. One YouTube reviewer labeled it as a “gimmick”; however, I can honestly say it is not a gimmick. For music listeners who have little to no hearing loss, perhaps HearID won’t make as much of a difference...like that reviewer. To him it might seem like a gimmick. But folks like me who love the rich sound of music, but suffer hearing loss, HearID can add those missing frequencies back into the mix, resulting in a massively pleasing audio experience. I’m just blown away! Audiophiles use pink noise to tune their speakers to produce a flat frequency response, eliminating as much audio weakness and over strengths as possible. The problem is that by itself, the speakers are tuned to themselves, not to the listener’s ears. While they can be tuned to provide a flat frequency response, the listener still hears dullness. HearID solves this problem! The combination of the Knowles armature and the 11mm—that’s not a typo—dynamic driver concentrically aligned provides plenty of sonic greatness across the entire frequency range, resulting in no weak spots. I was listening to a tune yesterday, and the bass was rich and deep, while not overly loud, resonated inside my entire head—seriously low! What would make these earbuds perfect? Active noise cancellation and multiple connections are the only two serious things that come to mind. It would also be nice if the user didn’t have to sacrifice one function, e.g., voice assistant, in order to use volume control. Not a deal breaker, but would be a nice touch. Overall, a fantastic purchase! Yes, I’d buy them again in a heartbeat! Good luck on your decision!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-18,Fantastic!!,Ok. I come from Bose and shure headphones and earphones. I was going to get the 325's or 535's from Shure but I was hearing a lot about these so I took the leap. And.... for 149.99 they're impressive. The sound is great though the bass is not as deep as they claim it is. But the overall sound is great.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-18,Great wireless earbuds,"These are great wireless earbuds, they are more comfortable and sound better than AirPods to me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-11-19,Staticky Noises,"The Liberty 2 Pros provide good sound quality and comfort, but they suffer from an annoying static noise. IN addition to that the firmware update keeps cancelling and saying error."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,0,2019-11-19,Terrible connection wont stay paired,Do not buy these headphones. They dont stay connected to your phone and one of them wont pair when you put them back in the case so I have to waste 5-10 minutes trying to repair them to my phone. I have a pair of 20 dollae headphones that dont sound nearly as good as these but what good are these headphone if I cant conveniently put them in and start using them. I wasted my money but I can save money for whomever is reading this
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-19,The sound is phenomenal and comparable to higher end earbuds. I am very happy with my purchase.,"The sound is amazing. Also, it stays in your ears when you running. All you have to do is to try different combinations of the earpieces provided. Sound settings also allow you to use a wide variety of presets. Details: Initially, I had ordered the highly exalted Sony WF-1000XM3, but was put off because of customer concerns about whether it was suitable for workouts at the gym, i.e., will fling out from your ears which you drop your barbells. So, I wanted for earbuds that had great reviews both in terms of sound quality and the ability to stay put during workouts. While the reviews on Amazon for these buds were rather negative, I attribute that do a bad batch during the initial manufacturing process. I did find that the reviews of the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds on Youtube, however, to uniformly excellent in terms of both sound and stability....to the point of being giddy. I went for it...and have had ZERO REGRETS. Here are some reasons I'm stoked every time I wear these:
(+) SOUND IS AMAZING: The app that comes with the Soundcore gives you a bunch of choices in how you sound is configured. So whether you like heavy metal, grunge, or classical, there a profile that works for you. (+) MASSIVE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS: If you want, the app that comes with it, can also create a custom profile where you have no excuse for not loving these earbuds. (+) They stay put! Honestly, I cannot imagine any scenario in the gym that would knock these buds off, unless you are doing full-contact fighting. Just make 100% sure that you try the different sized earbuds. (+) The buttons are easy to prices and that are oriented downward so that you're press into your ears. (+) You can also configure button options. For example, by default volume controls overly complicated. I swapped out less useful functionality to put volume controls as a higher priority. Room for Improvement? No deal killers hear, but there's one thing that I would like if to see in a future iteration:
Please, guys, create an app that enables you to switch seamlessly between different devices. For example, I listen to music both on my iPhone and my iPad. As it stands now, you have to turn off the Bluetooth of one device, in order to allow another device to grab onto Bluetooth. In Conclusion:
There are many wireless buds floating around. The price ranges are all over the place. There are cheap ones that perform well, such as Sabbat which I also own. Yes, I can go ahead and spend $200 for the Sennheisers and I'd be you'll be happy with that too. For me, this is a nice catch and I have zero regrets."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-19,Best I've Owned.,"I have had bluetooth headsets from Motorola, Apple, Samsung, Skullcandy, and Bose. These Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro are simply the best. Not just for the money either. They are cheaper then Apple, bose and samsung and are still better. The only place thats not true is the Bose had better noise cancellation. I have a friend that says the new Apple earpod pros are better. These are $100 cheaper than the Earpod pros and are so good that I don't even care to buy a set to even try them. My hunt for my head phones for the time being is over."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-19,"Amazing Sound, Mediocre Call","Pros:
1-Great sound with great bass. 2- Wireless charging works great. 3- Easily fits in my ears and is stable. 4- USB C and Fast charging. 5- Very good battery life. I used it for 6 hours with high volume. Cons:
1- Call quality: It is great in a silent room but is mediocre at best in crowded places. To me, this is a deal-breaker. 2- Comfort: It fits great in my ears but the plastic hook at the rear side of the buds becomes annoying after 3-4 hours of continuous use so comfort is so so for me. Of note, I have sensitive ears and maybe it will be comfortable for you. 3- There is no sensor to stop the buds while you put them out like Jabra 65t. 4- Background static( Hiss sound) you hear it 1-2 seconds Hiss sound between pausing and playing. I hear the same sound with my Jabra 65t and even some mid-range price full-size headphones but is less noticeable. I believe this is an issue with all true wireless buds. It is not an issue except for audiophiles. 5. No support for multiple Bluetooth devices but you can pair each bud separately to a different device. I connect one of them to my computer and the other one to my phone and worked fine,
Final verdict:
If you do not make a call in crowded spaces regularly, it is a great headphone and you will love it,
If you talk to your family while you are shopping like me, it is not a headphone for you. I read Soundcore Liberty Air 2 is great for calling. I will buy Soundcore Liberty Air 2 and update this post later on."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-20,There great but,I love everything about the headphones but the mic when I talk on the phone is not good. Talking on the phone the other person say I'm cutting in and out even in a quiet room
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-20,"Incredible sound, hard to find a good fit (not a dealbreaker)","The 4 star rating is not due to any product quality issue, but rather my own trouble getting them to work well with my ears. Obviously, that'll be different between everyone. I was skeptical about these just because of the price, and lots of products tend to claim amazing performance due to whatever fancy feature, but these actually sound incredible. The sound is so clear, mids and highs are overblown and the bass is punchy but not overbearing. They get very loud and don't lose any quality. Videos don't have any lag (Samsung Galaxy Note8, Android 9). I'm super impressed with these, they truly have studio quality. My biggest problem with them is that I personally am having a lot of trouble finding a good mix of the ear tip sizes and wing sizes. Some of them make my ears hurt, and some don't make a good seal. This is the most trouble I've ever had with a pair of headphones, but I'm determined to find the perfect match because they just sound so amazing. Highly recommend these, unless your ears are the same as mine. Edit:
I forgot to mention this at first, however the call quality with these headphones is nothing short of horrible. I am able to hear the other party fine but they cannot hear me. I think it's probably due to that ""sound canceling"" feature, but instead of highlighting my voice, they just cancel that as well. However that for me is not a huge issue really as I don't make many phone calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-20,Most Responsive Earbuds I own,I like that it came with multiple ear wings and tips for me to chose what fits best. Glad I didn't go with airpods :)
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-21,Sound quality of the higher brands,"For the price these TWL buds offer a lot. I tried the Sony WF 1000mx3 and I also have these buds little brother the non pro's. Compared to the Sony in terms of sound quality these are on par with them except these have more bass. The clarity is better than the little brothers that seem to distort the mid's and highs when more bass is introduced. Features this has the majority of what you need. Bluetooth 5.0. In my office I was able to walk easily to my break room which has offices and bathrooms between it and maybe is about 150ft away from my desk and didn't have any disconnects at all. Wireless charging (not a big deal to me right now since I don't have a wireless charging mat). Water resistance. This is great to have for those that workout or want to walk in the rain. Haven't had to rely on it yet but it's nice to know it is there. The battery life is amazing compared to other TWL. I have yet to come across a time I even came close to draining these. Fit/Comfort. Coming from someone that I can't even remotely where things like apples airpods these fit great and are very secure. The eartips do occasionally fatigue my ear, but that might be me needing foam tips which I am avoiding since I heard those can increase the bass even further and these buds don't need it imo. Now for some cons which I honestly think could be added in a firmware update:
For some reason when I remove the buds from the case it just randomly only connects one but not the other bud leaving me to redock them into the case and close it and try again. This is inconvenient, but not a dealbreaker. The same thing happens in there little brother. Sound pass through - it has none. It is a feature a lot of buds at this price range have. The ability to let your surroundings in even at the cost of battery life is great especially for office work or walking on the roadways so you can hear if anything is going on. Multi device pairing would be great. I don't understand why this isn't more use. I remember my first bluetooth headset had it and it is amazing. And keep in mind this was before the efficiency of bluetooth 5.0. I could pair them to my laptop and phone at the same time and it would automatically switch to which ever was giving off sound or if I was listening on my laptop and got a phone call it would switch to my phone on priority for the call. This imo is the biggest con when it comes to features. User specific EQ. The app has plenty of default presets, but many users want to customize it exactly to there liking (I am not one of them)
As a side note the hiss that others have complained about I do not hear it in these buds. So it might have been fixed in an update. The little brother buds do have it. Great buds for the price, would recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-21,Great Wireless Earbud,The Liberty 2 Pro has excellent sound and is very comfortable to wear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-11-22,Defects plague otherwise solid earbuds,"I'm writing this review after receiving my second pair of Liberty 2 Pro earbuds. I exchanged the first pair because they had a loud hiss at low volumes, making it impossible to listen to podcasts or meditation apps where you want low volume audio. Regrettably, the second pair has the same issue. For a $150 pair of earbuds I have to say this is completely inappropriate- Anker really needs to work on quality control since I've never had this issue before on other high end earbuds like my Bose Soundsport or Skullcandy buds. Sound quality is otherwise decent- with solid low, and mids particularly. It might be because of the hiss, but the highs sound awful in my opinion- even after tinkering with the eq settings in the Soundcore app.
Also, these buds often have significant problems when connecting to my MacBook Pro, and tend to cut out frequently, with audio switching from one earbud to the other- again, all issues I've never had with my Bose earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-22,Great sound but not a universal fit,"They sound amazing, even for earbuds, but I can't find any combination of ear tip and wing that will get these fit in my ears they are always sliding off."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-22,"Extremely comfortable earphones with very good sound, solid performance, and a well-designed case","PROs:
1. These are the most comfortable in-ear headphones I’ve ever had. My ears are hard to fit, and most in-ear buds either feel very uncomfortable right from the start, or start to fall out rather quickly with minimal motion, let alone when I run on a treadmill. (!) I must admit that I immediately replaced original silicone ear tips with the following, more comfortable foam ear tips: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RZS7KWG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1. More about it later. 2. I am enjoying the good quality of sound I did not expect from wireless, in-ear headphones. Sound quality is much better than that of comparably priced competitors like Amazon Echo Buds or more expensive earphones from other brands... (I am an audiophile, and a rather demanding one. I own Sennheiser Momentum M.2, Audio-Technica ATH-A900, HiFiMan 400i, let alone an Audio Research VSi60 tube amp paired to the venerable Klipschorns). 3. I also appreciate the case design, and especially the fact that it’s spacious enough to accommodate bigger, foam ear tips! I’ve immediately replaced the original ones with bigger/longer foam tips, and this is the first and only charging case that accommodates them without issues! All the other cases without exception (including Amazon Echo Buds that I returned due to numerous connection and quality issues) were too tight/cramped, and the earbuds either did not fit or could not be charged with bigger tips…
4. The earphones work solidly, without interruptions with both my Android smartphone and my Windows laptop. (The latter was paired using Bluetooth; no app for Windows). I have already participated in several hour-long conference calls without any issues. 5. The case is charged via the modern USB-C cable, like Android smartphones or chromebooks, not via obsolete Micro-USB cables (like many competitors). Wireless case charging is also a nice feature. 6. The earphones can work for several hours continuously, which is equal or better compared to other wireless earphones. CONs: The only noticeable CON so far is poor sound quality of the microphones emphasized by other reviewers. When I use the built-in mic, people can clearly hear and understand what I am saying, but all of them without exception emphasized how tinny and unnatural I sound. All of them said that they would have never even recognized my voice... To rectify this, I use the built-in microphone on my Windows notebook and chromebook. But this is not an option with the smartphone... Personally, I do not use the earphones for phone or WhatsApp/Viber calls on my smartphone, so this is not a big deal for me. But people who need to make hands-free calls on their smartphones on a regular basis need to take this into account. All other issues below are related to Chrome OS. I hope these can be resolved through firmware and app upgrades. On my HP Chromebook x2 the Soundcore app installs, but does not discover or recognize the earphones. The earphones pair just fine using Bluetooth, and are visible in the audio and BT settings at all times. BUT for some weird reason they stop transmitting sound every now and then! This is especially noticeable when I switch between Android apps and Chrome apps/windows (like Youtube). Each time I switch to a different app/window (say, from Youtube to VLC) there is a good chance that I will not hear anything. In order to restore sound I need to manually switch to the built-in speakers and then back to the BT device (Liberty 2 Pro). Then everything continues well for some time, but stability is completely lacking… It is especially bad in Android apps, where sound often disappears after 15-30 seconds. First the left earbud stops emitting sound, then the right one emits some cracking noise and disconnects too. Disconnects here means not that the device disappears, it looks fine in BT settings, but the sound is gone…
This chromebook-related issue is specific to Liberty 2 Pro, because my other BT headset, Sennheiser Momentum M.2 connects to the built-in chromebook Bluetooth card without issues or sound interruptions. I was able to rectify the issue by purchasing a small, inexpensive external USB-C Bluetooth sound card (B26: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QLQXJHW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that I inserted into one of the chromebook’s USB-C ports. The Liberty 2 Pro earphones paired with this BT sound card immediately, and the connection is stable. There are no sound interruptions whatsoever with this external BT sound card...
So far I had the Liberty 2 Pro earphones for approximately a week, and will update my review in case something changes."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-23,"Hissing disappointment, harsh vocal","The hissing noise is there and the sound quality didn't meet my expectation. I used the Soundcore app to tune them and after that they still don't sound that great. I tried a few sound profiles in the app and none of them sounded better. I used my 1More Triple Driver wired earphones and my wife's 1More Stylish True Wireless Earbuds for comparison, and I prefer their warmer tone to the Anker's. Compared to the Stylish the Liberty 2 Pro might have tighter bass and better clarity, but the vocal is just harsh and not for long listening sessions. If Norah Jones' voice sounds irritating then there is really no redemption. Hopefully the Sony WF-1000XM3 will be on sale soon."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-23,Bad for iPhone Good for Android,"I had high hope for these. But after connect them with my iPhone X right away i can tell the volume is very low, despite the good specs. Connection seems to drop sometimes with phone nearby. Still i connect them to a Oneplus6 things get pretty the sound bass every thing are noticeably nicer. I noticed theres a note popped on the screen say AptX mode active or something like that. I tried connect them to my Xr its the same. Really want to keep them as I got them during the early bird period. Disappointed because i bought them to use daily with my iPhone, i had returned the pair, cant trust Anker on this one."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-23,amazing amazing and amazing,for me these earphones are simply amazing. they tick every box when it comes to mind. the fit and finish is simply amazing. dare I say they are even a contender to my m+w.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-23,Worth every penny,Best sounding bluetooth earbuds I've ever used. Make sure the aptX is box is checked if available on your phone
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-23,Anker released a new version with no hissing!!!,"UPDATE: Anker has released a new version of these earbuds that have no noticeable hissing like the previous ones. With the hissing out of the way they sound fantastic. I can recommend them now! I returned the previous model (the ones with all the static) and I received the new models and they sound excellent. I can’t hear the hissing anymore even at low volumes at night or on vlogs. These came up to $163 including taxes. Before purchasing these I purchased the regular Liberty 2s but I did not like the sound quality on them. They had way too much bass and they sounded a bit scratchy and distorted. These sound a little more balanced but they still have a pounding bass that sometimes depending on the music you're listening to overpowers other instruments. I tried these out with several music genres, they struggle a lot with rock/metal. The drums completely overpower all the other instruments because of the bass. I really could not find an EQ to make all the instruments sound clear and balanced. I wish Anker allowed you to make your own custom EQ in the app. The Hearing ID did not work for me. I tried it several times and only made my music sound worse than the EQs. These are definitely not worth $150. No way, no how. You can buy Bose or Sony 1000XM3 earbuds for only $50 to $60 more and those destroy these in every way. At best these are worth $100 and the standard liberty 2s are worth around $60 to $70. Anker really needs to step up their game in the audio department if they want to make it big. Everyone on YouTube is saying these are fantastic and sound balanced. In no way do they sound balanced. Even with the FLAT EQ setting they sound very unclear and unnatural. I own the Liberty Neos which I bought last year and I think those sound better than these and they don't even have support for APTX or any high res audio codec. I'm very disappointed Anker, you guys make awesome Bluetooth speakers, power banks and charging cables but these new earbuds are not good."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-11-23,Not what they claim to be,Bass response poor with sound overall being 'tinny' and shrill. EQ variation very minute. Returning.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-23,"These stand next to my $1,000 Shure 846 closer than any other pair I own. Bravo Soundcore! Bravo!","Deep, clear, & detailed well sculpted base , clear and vibrant highs, mids that present themself smoothly and as well as the highs and lows - amazing! A rock solid connection that has not stuttered once in the 20 or so hours I’ve listen to them so far. I compared them with the new Sony in ear w/ noise cancellation and these trump those in terms of sound quality by LEAPS & BOUNDS! Negative? There is a slight hiss at low volume. Do I personally care? No the moment music is playing, it can not be perceived. The Sony was silent at lowest volume. I own many headphones from $1,000 Shures 846’s, to Planar magnet based audeze iSINE 20, the new power beat bro wireless, VModa cross fade wireless 2, among others (more I own listed below)
In conclusion: these are by far the BEST in ear wireless headphones I have used. The sound quality is phenomenal, the connection has been perfect thus far, the fit has been strong - although I did opt for some ear tips from an old hair of vModa “bassfit” in ear headphones (Terrible little headphones FYI) and found the fit to be even more snug, as I prefer. I buy and return headphones so often it’s crazy and I can safely say I have never been so impressed by such a pair of headphones in this price range. They stand well above the Sennheiser momentum’s, better than than the new Master & dynamics true wireless, and way better in pure sound quality while maintaining INCREDIBLE deep and detailed lows that never muddy the highs or drown out the mids. I’m impressed. The large dynamic driver fitted with a balanced armature here just shines. Clearly beating buds that sell for 2-3 times as much. Just wow. Bravo"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,0,2019-11-24,"Mine have the “white noise” flaw, which seems prevalent so I’d avoid until fixed","These are high quality, comfortable earbuds from a company I generally trust. But mine have the widely-reported background “white noise” or static others have complained of. I’ve compared to other Bluetooth earbuds I own, including some from Anker, and none have the issue. Sound quality seems very good (aside from this) and it’s a slick package, but I can’t recommend due to this issue. I’m returning them since they say this is “rare,” but based on the number of reviews mentioning it it appears pretty widespread. I’ll edit the review if the replacements (which I haven’t ordered yet due to shipping issues with my original order and my concern I’ll be without them for an extended period) or a firmware update is able to fix this."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-24,Issues are fixed!! A company who listens!,Love the new firmware update that fixes alot of the older issues. And the long battery life and fast charging never going back to old blue tooth headsets.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-24,"Great audio, satisfactory voice","Fits well, sounds great, voice calls are good though not great. Storage / charging container is larger than some others but no larger than it needs to be. Overall I love it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-24,Awesome,"Very pleased with this item, amazing sound and battery life. Totally recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-11-24,Mediocre sound and uncomfortable,"First of all, they are too big for my ears and are very uncomfortable after about an hour of use. There is NO noise cancelling effect and they have an annoying hiss. These dont sound nearly as good as the headphones that come with phones. Good bass but poor treble and voices sound like they are cracking. Very disappointed with these as they were expensive."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-24,Great fit with multiple ear plugs and ear pieces to hold well in ear.,Pairs easily and sound quality great for better price than AirPods
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-25,Questionable,"No question about quality of sound. It is good. But in efficient. Volume is not enough. It you like loud music, you will be very disappointed. Not sure if this is as good as it should be for the money . For A lot less money you can get much better sound with regular wired earphones"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-25,Great!!!,These ear buds sound so amazing and have deep bass! Easy to use and overall amazing
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-26,"Really great, without the price of Beats, Apple, B&O, Sony, Ect!","Nicely presented packaging, unboxing is very satisfying! Easy to use and pair to my Pixel 4XL! I found the ear cushions and wings very comfortable and they don't fall out of my ears (you get 7 sets)! Awesome phone application with more than 20 EQ settings! Button customizations are available too! Sound quality easily on par with the higher end wireless earbuds that are twice the price, (disclaimer I got a $40 off coupon via a youtube reviewer, which made it even better). Battery life I got the product almost 2 weeks ago charged it once and its still on 2 of 3 light dots for charge! Very impressive! Overall I'm very satisfied and would recommend to anyone not looking to spend over $200!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-26,"Real studio sound, stopped pairing after 1 month","I just got these liberty pro 2s, and they sound amazing. My son has the Sony Wf1000xm3 earbuds ( which are also amazing ) and have a crisper sound, but these have a warmer, fuller base sound, more true to real studio sound. The Hear ID on the phone app was interesting, but I prefer the soundcore signature setting on the equalizer. Definitely do the firmware update. Update: after 1 month the left earbud stopped pairing, I just requested a replacement , will update review after the second set arrives."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-26,Finally a decent wireless earbuds with ear tips,"Just received it, seems good so far, yet to try some more. Will update review along the way"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-26,The music sounds absolutely amazing,Best bang for your buck
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-27,I am happy with these buds!,I am very happy with the feel and construction. These earbuds are the best sounding buds I have ever heard. Phone calls on the other hand could use improvement. I have noticed depending on the situation the person on the other side of the call sometimes have a hard time hearing me. That has only been in loud environments other wise in quite environments they are awesome.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-27,"Good bang for your buck, but semi-finiky","Overall Great ear buds, battery life was awesome, they come with a bunch of different ear pieces so you can size them to your ear and were comfortable even after wearring them for 5 hours. Sound quality was pretty good, better then the Gen 1 airpods, not nearly as good as the Sennheisers. The noise canceling isn't active, but does a better job then others. The only complaint I have is when listening to just to left or right bud individualy and switching between the two I have to re-pair them, not connect them again but actually ""forget this device"" and re-pair them, kind of a pain and with today's technology shouldn't really be an issue."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-11-27,Good but not good enough,Good for listening to music but bad for phone calls
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-28,Great sound okay battery,These sound great it's just that I don't get 8 hrs out of these maybe like 6 at best buy other than that they are worth it
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-11-28,Hands down one of the best earbuds on the market,"I've tried quite a few earbuds, including $400 Master & Dinamic and let me tell you Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro blows them all out of competition. Sound is phenomenal especially when you use it with Soundcore app that lets you choose your pre-sets and adjust sounds based on your hearing. Equalizer pre-sets perfectly adjusted for different music genres to make it sound better than any over the ear headphones I've used like Bower & Wilkins. It plays roughly 8 hours on one charge."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2019-11-28,White noise/Good sound/Poor fit. Great Anker service though,"Update 2: These cant' connect to multiple devices.. a big negative to me especially since I have a work phone and a laptop. Fit is also very finnicky, the profile simply sticks out way too much, even more so than Sony WF1000XM3.. Not good for the gym. I've also found the acoustic sound profile on the app to be my favorite simply because it really boosts the volume. Signature profile is way too low even on max. Update: Anker service has been great, as usual. They reached out to me and offered to send a revised version. When I received it, of course first thing I did was check for the white noise issue. It's still there. However, it's been reduced about 40% I would say. For many people, it's probably OK unless you are in any sort of quiet environment like an office. A new bug popped up though which is the left and right buds disconnecting from each other and actually showing both in bluetooth menu. Left earbud kept getting static and dropping signal for fractions of a second. Had to do a hard reset for them to pair together again. The fit is also clunky because of the how much they stick out on your ear, like half an inch. They are off balance and not ideal for gym exercises with a lot of head movement like jogging. I also don't like the way the earbuds go into the case, it's just very unintuitive. These were hyped a lot by reviewers and by Anker, I am a little underwhelmed given the price. Great service by them nonetheless. While the packaging and build is excellent, the biggest issue is the white background noise hiss that happens whenever something is playing. When you stop the audio, you will continue to hear it for a few seconds and then it stops. Not good for audio podcasts with slow or mellow talking. It's very unfortunate for something that retails for $150.. While it would be okay for something if you could get it at $100 or less, it's probably not okay for something that has more competitors at the retail price, namely Airpods. I'm surprised this made it out of quality control, seems like the issue is very common."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-11-29,Very happy with Liberty Pro 2,"This is my first pair of totally wireless headphones and they've really impressed me. My priorities start with sound and comfort, which were fulfilled by the Liberty Pros. Occasionally one of the headphones may not connect immedietly out of the case, I just put it back and take it out again, or power cycle it with the button on each headphone. Beyond those blips I've found their connection to be really reliable. There is a delay, as expected, that could make watching videos frustrating, however many video apps allow you to set an audio offset adjust which worked for me (vlc). Battery life has been really good and the wireless charging case is really clutch."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-30,"Best sound, has some hissing","I bought one for me and my wife. I hear hissing on mine, noticeable when hearing audiobook. Sound is very good, as good as my sony headphones, very deep bass. Good among many music styles. Fitting for me is not perfect, but it's good enough. I ran with them for 20 minutes, and i had to adjust them about 2 times. Fitting on right hear tends to be more challenging, and have to adjust it once a hour, while being still. For me, It starts to be uncorfortable after 3/4 hours of continue use, due to the wings. (Wings purpose is to make it stable)
No connectivity issues. Case is very practical. I wish the app allows custom equalizer. Would give 5 stars if the fit is perfect + 0 hissing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-11-30,Good pair but the white noise killed it for me,"I've been using it for a week and here are my thoughts (i am an ordinary music lover, not an audiophile):
Pros:
- Soundstage is good. I can hear the separation quite clearly. - Many preset EQs for you to choose. - Multiple earbuds to find your fit. - Like all other earphones, it sounds wonderful if you get a perfect fit
- Excellent sync with youtube and netflix. Unable to tell if there is any sync delay
- Value for money if bought with promo codes/ discount. Unsure if you can get another item with comparable quality
- Anker service is excellent
Cons:
- White noise (sssss sound). It is slightly audible when you are in a quiet environment, especially without music. Extremely audible when you listen to podcasts. - Highs are a bit too high so certain vocals (especially s sounds) will come off as sharp. Not sure if this is due to the earphones or the music. - Doesn't stay in the ear too well due to the design. Since it pops out, when you walk or move your jaw when you are chewing, the earbuds might get loose. - Comfort. It wasn't very comfortable at first but i got used to it after a few days. - Sound isolation is decent. Unable to isolate well if you are in a loud environment. - Sync was a bit off when i play games on my iphone x. Playable but the sync delay was obvious. Conclusion:
Right now i think it's a good pair of earphones to enjoy music but i experience ear fatigue when i use it for more than 30mins due to the sharp sounds and the slight discomfort. It is a very good pair of earphones if not for the white noise which really bothered me. I would say anker is on the right path to creating a perfect pair but right now they are not there yet. However i am excited to see what they can offer once they rectify their flaws."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-11-30,Great sound!,"Sound quality is superb, cherry on the top is the companion app is awesome. The app can test my hearing spectrum range and set a personalized sound profile for me, it sounds actually very good to my ear. I have tested HiFiman 400i? paired with tube amp, under 320kbps mp3 the Liberty Pro 2 can keep up with HiFiman just fine with my personalized equalizer profile, vocal is full and not too forward, bass is tight. Only it's a inear sound bud, the sound stage is not as wide as the much bigger open headphones. I haven't tested lossless tracks yet, but for Bluetooth earbuds listening to lossless is really not the intended use. Only complaint is the box exterior looks cheap and packing lakcks refinement. They can definitely do better there. Overall It's worth it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-01,White Noise/Hissing Sound before and during playing,"Update December 8th, 2019:
After the very fast(expected to be 1-2weeks and it came in nearly 6days), the second ""new and improved"" pair arrived. Customer service, both the service team and the manager, replied swiftly to help me out. After pairing and trying it out I still noticed the similar hissing/white noise as I stated previously, but only the left pair is less than the original. I'm addition, seems like the firmware doesn't want to update to 1.22 from 1.17(states that it is up to date). Waiting to see if I need to return or try a third pair. But besides this problem, everything else is excellent: Sound Quality (exception of the noise), calls, comfortable, ip4x rating (it can withstand light rain and light sprinkle, no submergence)), and the benefits of button with different actions. Good luck on the purchase. Old:
I bought this during Black-Friday and I received on Saturday night. It ""appear to be a used"" product. I used my flashlight to check out everything and it appeared to be scratched in the charging case and also the Liberty Pro 2's themselves too. It's similar to the clear coat swirl scratches on a car. I later installed the app and installed the software update and I waited 5min(good time) for them to try it out. I noticed the hissing sound at the beginning of playing a song. It takes 2 second until it plays a song because of Bluetooth but Everytime I pause a song I can hear it. I can also hear the hissing sound during classical instrumental music that have a low dynamic and I have my volume to the max. It literally ruins the music because I can hear more hissing then music. Call volume and conversation are really great. But, I can still hear hissing sounds when the person on the side is not talking even though they are in a room too. It seems like everytime the Liberty Pro 2 is in action (that means it's doing something) it always has a hissing and white noise sound. I wish this could be fixed because I might return them if customer service does not clear this up. Thank you for your time."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-01,Great for calls,"Great sound, really good call quality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-01,I wanted to like them but they just weren't good enough.,"I love Anker products and I read great reviews of these but they just didn't work. The app is really nifty and it definitely enhanced my listening and side by side with the Liberty Air 2s, these sound better . . . but somehow they weren't better in practice. I couldn't hear recordings on my iMac with them. I couldn't hear phone calls very well. I couldn't hear a single thing if I tried to listen to them outdoors or in the subway or on the street. Anyone I talked to on the phone complained about the calls dropping out. Oh, and I often had to keep re-pairing them with my phone every time I put them on. It was very stressful. Eventually I just had to give up. The Liberty Air 2s are better but I've ended up with 1More Stylish earbuds--the top ones recommended by Wired. The sound really works."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-01,"Sound quality is great, but poor functionality","Sound quality is great, but there are functionality problems. Unable to update firmware, it has failed numerous times, so unable to use the Soundcore app. The left ear bud disconnects at times, and there is a subtle white noise hissing at times."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-01,Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!,WOW. These buds are AWESOME!!!!!!! They LITERALLY sound like EVERY instrument has its own separate speaker and it's all combined together to fit in Your ear. I even enhanced the bass through the EQ for extra punch because I LOVE Bass and I was really impressed with all the different options to make YOUR Sound fit YOUR liking! LOVE THEM!!!!!!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-01,Well worth the wait.,"These are quite possibly the easiest pairing headphones I have ever owned. Very intuitive. The sound quality has been great especially after taking their little hearing test. There is a very slight dead air sound when there is no sound but it's not nearly as bad as others have made it out to be and it doesn't bother me at all. The battery life has been good enough to make it through my day and it charges easily wirelessly. I can't personally judge how they sound on a call but I have no complaints from others. They are probably my favorite earbuds to wear so far, they are very comfortable and not nearly as heavy as I expected them to be. The case has been very satisfying as well. It has a nice soft touch to it. The lid slides open very nicely with one hand. And the ear buds drop right into place with the magnets."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-02,Great Sound,So far everything works great. Great sound and buttery life
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-02,Definitely worth the money,"Definitely worth the money to me. They sound great, and the battery feels like it lasts forever. I particularly like the sound profile. It sounds pretty good all the way from very low tones to very high tones. The HearID feature is pretty awesome as well. For me it hardly needs to adjust the eq, but depending on your hearing, it could make a big difference."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-02,Price,"I love the liberty 2 pro all the all the way. What I didn't like was I purchased them on black Friday expecting a great deal, and on cyber Monday they are even cheaper days later."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-02,Superb,Fantastic product
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-02,Lots of size options.,Fit my ear well and I have very small ears. Has very good bass and not bad treble.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-02,Differences between Liberty 2 and Liberty Pro2,"Alright so the night before the philly marathon, my friend had a malfunction with his headphones. I gave him my bluetooth headphones to use and then I went out and bought the Liberty 2s from Best Buy. I was nervous because I've never used them before but they got decent reviews and I trust Anker products. Morning of the marathon, I popped in the L2s using the buds and fins that came on the buds. 4 hours and 20 minutes of running and had no issues with comfort or sound. Needless to say I ended up keeping the L2s! Sounded great and no issues with comfort. This lead me to looking into the LP2 Pros. My review is going to be less about the actual headphones and more about if the $50 difference is worth it (it was really hard to find a definitive list of differences during my research)
I ordered the LP2s from Amazon to compare before deciding which ones to keep:
Sound-I consider myself an audio snob and listen to mainly punk rock music. There is a clear difference between the 2. I dont know if all the jargon on the website is gimmick or real but I could tell the difference. The Liberty 2s sound great at all volumes and the EQs on the app give you a variety of sound profiles. Despite that, all profiles had a high level of bass for my liking. The Flat and Rock EQs turned down the over powering bass (which is a must of podcasts) but didn't like having to change the EQ base don what I was listening to. The L2s have 10mm drivers which makes the audio loud yet clear. The LP2s on the other hand don't have this problem. The LP2s have 11mm drivers and the website highlights Balanced Armature Driver and Harmonized Sound. The sound on the LP2s is much more balanced. Not necessarily louder but more clear
Feel- Both ear buds have the same buds/fins. You may have to mess around to get the best combo for tight ear seal but follow the directions Anker provides to twist and seal. It really does make a difference if you put the earbuds facing down and twisting forward vs jamming the bud in your ear. The L2s have a shiny black plastic finish which I prefer over the LP2s matte grey finish. But the L2s case feel like cheap plastic vs the soft case of the LP2s. Not a deal beaker but a noticeable difference. If I dropped the L2 I would think it would split apart. The LP2s dont give me that worry
Battery Life- same on both
Random but- L2s are IPX5 waterproof LP2 are IPX4 waterproof
Dreaded ""white noise""-no white noise issue on the L2s at all. LP2s do have a faint white noise but only when you have the earbuds in and no music is playing at all. Once audio starts playing it goes away. Also please note it really isnt that big of a deal. Reviews make it seem like a piercing unbearable noise. It's really faint. If anyone has any question feel free to post. But to sum it up I do think the extra $50 is worth it if you are an audio snob and dont want a heavy bass profile. If this is your first pair of wireless earbuds or looking to replace older BT headphones go with the L2s for $100 which is a steal"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-03,High Performance Earbuds,"I had to change ear tips and holders for 1 size bigger to get that snug custom fit that fully blocks the ear canal. Once the fit is locked in for noise cancellation, I set up my custom hearing profile for each speaker. These sound incredible. I’ve had Beats Solo HD’s, Beats X, and Sony DJ Remix headsets in the past. The true wireless buds here are so comfortable and have crystal clear drivers and bass that sound gorgeous to all audiophiles alike. Huge fan of this studio sound and great fit. Awesome price for the value you’re getting in these small but powerful wireless earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-03,Great Sound for wireless Earbuds,"Great Sound for wireless Earbuds. Punchy and clear bass, with detailed highs. These earbuds have a V shape sound stage/setting. The sound quality is very Hi-res and premium. Good with almost all genres of music/audio. Happy with the product so far. A few cons:
A bit of Hiss (Floor Noise). Sometimes the ""hiss"" can be heard in vocals. With the V-shape sound, the mids are bit recessed as compared to High's and Low's. More specifically the low-mids are but recessed. The Soundcore app lets you custom pick the preset EQ setting you like but I wish it had an option to manually adjust the EQ setting to I can push up the mids without changing other frequencies."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,0,2019-12-04,Static noise background- Hiss,"I ordered one set of Liberty 2 Pro via Amazon.fr last week and I have just received them. As a precautionary measure, I have not even opened the parcel and returned it. I do not want to take the risk on the hiss. Maybe, I will re-consider to re-order the product at a later stage, if I receive the assurance from Anker that the issue is fixed and it is not a faulty engineering design patched with a software upgrade."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-04,Great earbuds.,"Absolutely amazing pair of earbuds, you can actually feel bass and the sound is amazing. The extra fittings are awesome, the packaging was also very impressive. My only complaint would be that with different fittings they don't fit into the case. But otherwise, very much worth the money and I have no regrets. Thanks for the awesome product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-04,These are by far the best so far,"Update #2: Soundcore just updated their application and now you can customize the sound with an eight band equalizer. Love all the updates. Still the best so far! Update #1: Firmware 1.22 really fixed some of the small flaws in the sound and function. Thanks Anker, really really great! I have had almost ever brand and type of bluetooth ear buds that have been made. I have tried the most expensive ones to the cheapest ones. These are my favorite so far. I have used all of the current models and these (for me) have the best fit, the best sound, and the best features. Unlike some manufactures they have the ability to upgrade their firmware, which I appreciate. The other option that appealed to me is the Soundcore application, nice that they have an app. The sound is very detailed/bright with a nice bass punch, as well as wonderful mids. Really impressed with the sound stage and spatial feeling. Anyway, please don't hesitate to try these. They are incredible for the price. They are as good as, if not better than the top tier true wireless buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-04,"Excellent, just buy them!","I love music and all types. These wireless buds are excellent. Super high quality, great bass, and very good highs. For $129, you won't find better. I have had a bunch, these are the one's."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-04,Liberty 2 Pro,"The battery indicator in the application is not working properly. If you want to see the current battery level you must restart the application or reconnect to the application. Next problem: the right earbud is the main earbud, the left one does not work without it. The right earbud discharges faster than the left earbud (2 hours difference) I don't know why the manufacturer did not give a larger battery capacity for the right earbud to compensate for energy consumption. I think it's the cost of production. If you don't mind these battery problems then the rest of the function works fine. The sound is strong and saturated very well in all sound bands. They have much better sound quality like the Sony WF-1000XM3"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-04,Solid Product,Fit is not the best even trying all the variations of ear plug options
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-04,outrageously amazing sound,hands down BEST headphones I've EVER owned.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-05,Great Overall Product,"I currently have them in my ears right now as I am writing this review, and they sound amazing. Like seriously, as an uneducated idiot, these have the best sound quality out of any headphones I have ever used. Now keep in mind that I am novice audiophile and am generally impressed by anything. Now there are a lot of people who have pointed out the static background noise, so I won't waste too much time with that. But I will say that it exists and is noticeable. I don't care about it, but I am sure that there are humans that this will be a deal-breaker for. Otherwise, the charging case makes me weep from its raw beauty. No man should have access to this kind of tech, but we do and we are blessed for it. Overall, its great and if you don't mind weird seconds of static, you should really buy it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-05,Great Sound Overall,Exceptional sound for the price point in Bluetooth ear pod categories. Background hissing is squandering the quality. Will write a new detailed review after using a non defective pair.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2019-12-05,I cannot recommend these,"I'm very disappointed in these earbuds after such high expectations. I originally purchased the model under the pro. They sounded great initially but about a week later, no one could hear me on calls. I worked with soundcore to get a replacement. After the replacement the left ear was horrible. Kept popping and cracking on calls. They asked me to update the app and it got even worse. Same problems but now it started to drop connection in the left ear. They agreed to send me the pro model and this is what I've experienced in 1 week:
Pros :
Great range - I have a very big house and I'm able to walk around and even to the garage with little to no problems. Latency - no latency when watching YouTube
Sound - these sound amazing. I really love the bass. For earbuds, these are the best I've heard. Battery life - really good. It will get me through a day with the case but I've gotten about 6 hours when the claim is 8. I love the wireless charge case. Cons:
Call quality - When talking on the phone, it's there is any background noise, no one will hear you. I'm so tired of being asked to repeat myself. Also the left ear constantly pops, cracks, and even drops connection. This is really the only con that I complain about on the regular. I wish it came with a shallow ear tip but that's preference and no fault of the product. Soundcore has told me that they are aware of the problem and working on a new update to fix it so fingers crossed. I could then recommend this with 0 issues"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-05,I absolutely love them. You should get these for music listening.,"After two months, I'm back to update my review:
I absolutely love these earbuds. They are officially my favorite for music listening. 1. Excellent sound quality
2. Solid bluetooth connectivity
3. EQ presets, custom EQ, and personalized available. 4. Great case docking and charging. What could be better? 1. Charging case could be a little smaller. I often take my airpods instead because the case fits in my jeans ""5th pocket."" 2. Phone calls mic quality isn't any better than everyone else. Get AirPod Pros if you spend a lot of time on the phone and the sound quality pretty good as well. I got the (Anker) Zolo Liberty+ when it started as kickstarter years ago. They immediately became my favorite for their sound quality with the ""Pop"" EQ setting. I knew I had to try Liberty 2 Pro. I was afraid they wouldn't sound as good, but they have become my new favorite. I have bought many many many wired and wireless earbuds and over the ear cans over they years. Without talking about all other earbuds, for an iPhone user my recommendation is AirPod Pro or these Liberty 2 Pro. Here's how I use them:
Liberty 2 Pro for listening to music (or podcasts or video/movies)
Airpod Pros: Everything else. Airpod Pros are smaller and more pocketable. The active noise cancelling and transparency mode are very convenient for noisy public areas. They are much batter for phone calls. The sound quality is good but lack on bass and tend to be a bit mid-high but they have a clean clear balanced sound otherwise. Sound Quality:
Sine I talk about sound quality here's my elaboration:
1. Strong bass, but just a bass-heavy sound. They have solid lows, plenty of warm upper bass. Clear mids, and well represented high end all the way up to the highest treble where most earbuds fall off. 2. My favorite custom EQ setting is ""Flat"" or ""Bass Reducer."" To be honest the bass on flat is often almost too strong so the bass-reducer gives me a little less fatigue for long listening periods. 3. I have tried the personalized EQ. It does a hearing test on you and customizes the EQ to your hearing deficiencies. It comes up with basically none for me except sometimes one level on the very high end. I don't get any improvement out of it and prefer the standard ""flat"" and ""bass reducer"" (flat with less bass.) 4. There is now a custom EQ. It's great for tweaking it exactly how you like it, but again, I find flat and bass reducer to be ideal. I can't seem to do much better for my taste. 5. I listen to a lot of rock, EDM, and acoustic performances. I don't listen to hip-hop or rap much. With my list of test songs I get replication of subtle instrument sounds quality. Airpod Pro sound quality by comparison:
Airpod Pros represent the full spectrum of music cleanly. The bass is there and represented but just not nearly strong enough. I'm not a bass fan but I want to hear. The highs are also very well represented, and they sound a bit ""mid"" heavy maybe because the bass is weak. Still, they sound great and if you want one earbud that does it all, Airpod Pros are the one to have. They fit easily in my pocket, great phone call quality, and ANC is great for shorter plane rides or noisy places. I personally use Airpod Pros a lot, but Soundcore LIberty 2 Pro whenever I can to listen to music."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-05,Good sound. Rife with Bluetooth issues. Also Hissessss.,"Update (01/13/20):
I got contacted by the Anker customer service, and they offered me a free replacement to try with the assurance that the issues I raised have been addressed. Here are my impressions after a couple of weeks of use:
* Points for sound, looks, battery life, and USB-C. * The unit still has the hissing background. * Bluetooth is still problematic. Doesn't always connect to the last device unless manually done on the device. * Strange battery mismatch between L and R, with the latter running out of juice faster. The customer service person I communicated with confirmed that that's expected. It's a poor experience (R starts complaining while L is juiced up), and not something I experienced with other bluetooth earphones. * Impressed by the customer service even though the earphones didn't work out that well for me. ----------------------------------------------------------
+ Great sound. Everything is clear and crisp, and these can get real loud too. + Both the earphones and the case look pretty stylish. + Battery life is amazing. Easily goes all day for me without even popping them back in the case. + Both USB-C and wireless charging are nice, modern additions. - Bluetooth management has been a pain. Don't connect to my phone on taking them out. Manual switch needed (turn Bluetooth off on the previous device) for connecting to a different device. I got a message “Soundcore rejected pair request” and my right earphone stopped working (left still did). - I got the unit with the hiss. While not noticeable for most music, it’s pretty audible between pause/play. - Case cover doesn’t always sit flush for my unit and that affects charging. There were times that left was discharged while right was full. - Could not get a good seal. Tried different combinations of fins and tips but to no avail. - A little too big/bulky for active stuff. I always felt they were coming out in the gym when doing exercises like bench press. Overall, a poor experience, and I will be returning these. I have used several true wireless earphones (galaxy buds, jabra 65t, melomania, JBuds icon) and these were the most problematic. Maybe it was my unit but I am not going to try another pair to find out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-06,Wow... !AWESOME Bass!,"The sound quality is impressive. they are far better than my jabra 65t. Worth every penny.. for $110 can't beated. They are very loud and the bass is AWESOME. I love the bass. If you love bass, go no further, this will be perfect for you.. The buds are in the larger side, but that larger earbuds give you great sound quality, impressive bass and battery life."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-06,I don't understand the hype,"I've read and watched a number of reviews about these, including the Grammy winning producers that vouched for these things... and I just don't get it. Did those producers actually listen to these before endorsing them? The background hiss when music is playing is the worst I've heard (even with the new firmware update) among the multitude of true wireless headphones I've owned or tested running the gamut from $50 to $350. On top of that I couldn't find a single ear tip and ear wing combo that provided both a comfortable and secure fit. The only thing good about these things is the audio quality punches above its weight for the price, but the hissing and frequent cutouts and loss of ear to ear sync are show stoppers."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-07,Great sounding bluetooth earphones,"Good sound quality for a bluetooth earbud, although they're a little heavy on bass even on the flat setting. They're built well, like most Anker products are. These would get 5 stars if they didn't have a faint hiss. It's just noticeable for a couple seconds after pausing, or between songs. Update:
Anker sent me a replacement and the hiss is much quieter, only noticeable in complete silence."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-12-07,Great Sound,I really like the sound of these but I could not get a good fit and I had to send them back. They're ok for around the house but didn't work for the gym.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-07,Best Bluetooth Earbuds! Give it a look before dropping $250 in AirPod Pro.,"I was looking for a replacement for my first gen Apple AirPods. I didn't like the fit in the sense that ambient sound leaked into these things like water into the Titanic. Now, I will grant you that these were not touted as noise cancelling but these were ridiculous. I had to turn the volume up all the time if there was any type of background noise. I looked at the AirPod Pros. I like the fit and the ambient noise was cut. The sound was not that good at all. And for $250 that seemed like a lot to ask for that quality of sound. The sound quality of the Liberty 2 blows both Apple products out of the water. The bass is nice and punchy which I didn't find on the AirPod Pro. The battery lasts longer. You can program the buttons to skip to next track, raise or lower volume or launch Siri. The only thing missing is that my Apple Watch had the battery life status of the AirPods. If that is a deal breaker for you over sound quality. . . . then you know what to purchase. I am an Apple guy. Trust me when I tell you that I wanted the AirPod Pro to be better. They just aren't. Even if the price points were the same I would still choose the Liberty 2 Pro."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-07,Amazing sound for a great price,Great sound I have been searching for a good quality earbud at a reasonable price they exceeded my expectations. The app is fantastic for dialing in the sound to perfection.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-07,Best wireless earbuds,"First of all, the packaging is great and includes a bunch of ear tips and wings. The earbuds sounds great and lasts me very long. The sound quality is as good as some headphones. I haven't had the white noise problem that i read on the reviews though and i think they fixed it already."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-12-08,Super Jelly!!,"I got these as a present for my wife. I love her and she deserves a good set of ear buds, but DANG!!! I should have gotten two sets!! because after helping her get them configured for her phone and her sound profile using the Soundcore app, it made me a bit jealous. I'm not gonna lie. I've been wearing headpones since before the original Walkman. I have never heard a better sounding set of headphones. EVER!.I don't normally get worked up about earbuds, but these are not your average run of the mill earbuds. No way!! They are beautiful to look at, EASY to setup and use and have the purest audio I have ever heard. Great for calls on the move or jammin to all your favorite licks. They charge quickly, the charging case will get you 32 hours o total listening time. The sound quality is freaking amazing. they are light and have all or more features than higher priced brands. Some folks want to impress others by getting Bose, Harmon Kardon or Sennheiser, but they are fools. These things will out perform those any day of the week. I'd bet a box of donuts on it! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-08,Better than AirPods at a cheaper price,"Ant go wrong with these...you can probably hear every note any type of music genre....sound is amazing, battery is great, companion app could use some work, but it very user friendly....the only reason I gave these 4/5 is because of the phasing white noise that you hear, but it’s not annoying to the point where I feel the need to return. Not bad for $109."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-08,Very surprised,"I love these earbuds. I’ve done a lot of research on YouTube and read all the reviews. In making my choice for the right earbuds, my main criteria was price, bass, overall loudness, clean sound, a wireless charging case, some sort of water resistance, comfort and watching videos on my phone. The overall sound is very rich and balanced with just the right amount of bass. I have a pair of Jbuds air and wireless beats x. I know it’s not fair to compare them to the Jbuds due to the difference in price but these get almost as loud as the Beats X wireless. I like to listen to my music loudly when I workout and these do the job. I typically listen to Rap and 80’s music and am surprised on how much bass and clean sound they reproduce. I also listen to a lot of Classical music when relaxing and am happy to say these are very clean with no hissing. They will never sound as good or have as much bass as my Beats studio wireless headphones but for an earbud they are amazing. I’ve also tested these in the gym and have had no issues with sweat hitting the earbuds. I also have not had any audio syncing issues watching videos on my phone while working out. My set did not have any of the hissing issues I read about on the other reviews. I think I made the right choice."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2019-12-08,A HORRIBLE OOBE,"I'm assuming my unit was defective. But you may find this info helpful anyway. After each connection, the volume defaulted to 100% on my Android device. I didn't notice that at first, and it nearly blew my head off. I'm a professional software developer. I would have defaulted to 50% at most. The Soundcore app performed a firmware update which reported success. I beg to differ. My unit sounded tinny, WAY TOO MUCH TREBLE. Bass response was sorely lacking regardless of the preset selected. My unit was unable to handle lower frquencies correctly. The sound was distorted at best. Sorry, Anker, but in my professiinal opinion, speakers connected to a device that functions as a computer SHOULD NOT be handling EQ AT ALL. That's a job for the source device. Doing it otherwise results in conflicts that subvert both systems. The result was, that my $30 LG headset beat the absolute crap out of your more expensive unit. I use Equalizer+ Android app to control my sound, and I get super bass with absolutely no distortion. I guess I'll stick with this and forget about ear buds. Ear bud companies reading this: Open invitation to change my mind. Hope you all have better luck."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-08,audiophile level true wireless ear buds,"Ok. So let's get the bad out of the way first:
* no hear through
* no noise cancellation
* a little big
* no customizable equilizer as of now
Ok, now that's out of the way. These might be the best true wireless ear buds I have ever heard. The sound reproduction was wonderful. Solid bass, great treble and good Mids. Just a great performer overall. When i first see the package and it mentioned about 11 grammy artists suggestion and Astria Coaxial Acoustic Architecture, I thought I was all marketing BS. But these are really good in term of sound reproduction. I have tested them with various music genres, and they all sound great. If you are looking for more fancy features such as hear through, noise cancelling etc, these are definitely not for you. But if you want great sound and great music with long battery life, these are probably the best for under $200. Especially when they are on sale for $110. I don't really hear much else out there that can sound this good for this price. Maybe the sennheiser momentum true wireless, but I haven't tried those yet. But for the price, these cannot be beat."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2019-12-09,multi-point is not supported,"Even my cheap gym headset from 2014-th connects at the same time to my phone and tablet, but for $150 2019 device apparently it's too much to ask"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,Stay hydrated,Ive had them for a week now i use them walking to work for about 30 mins each way havent died on me yet have to take one out so i can hear my surroundings when walking at night
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,Awesome headset,This has to be one of the best true wireless headphones on the market. The clarity and bass these have are outrageous. I love anker products
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,"Great sound, great value!",I absolutely love these. I used the CNET deal of the day and got these at a great price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,These earbuds can hang with the best of them...,Wow!!! Anker strikes again with great quality products. Great gift for the holidays with an awesome price. Sounds great!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-09,Wanted to love these but they have a hiss,"Like others have said, at low volume you hear a hiss. Otherwise, they're fantastic. Kind of a shame."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,Great,I am beyond happy with this product. Only thing the price dropped the next day by 40 dollars. That sucked.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,Good earbuds for the price,Sound really good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,One of the best,One of the best wireless headphones for the price
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-09,True wireless headphones,Pretty good. Fast connection.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,"Sound better than any earbuds I’ve heard, and I’ve tried nose, Sony, jabra, etc...","There is definitely something different about these. The sound is tight, clear, and instruments can be distinguished from one another much more transparently than I’ve heard from other headphones in the past. Anker has definitely been stepping up their game. They aren’t active noise canceling while listening to music, and therefore have no sound external pass through option... but they do have noise cancelation during phone calls-which makes me wonder if they aren’t a firmware update away from that adjustment while playing music? Either way, they are exceptionally good at sound isolation, and on a level comparable to active noise cancellation. I used Sony WH1000XM3’s for music, and these for on the go, at the gym, etc... They’re worth every penny and sound amazing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-09,Microphone problem,"I was super excited when i ordered them ... but dissapointed . Battery life is very god , quality very good and sound is outstanding but allways when i talk on the phone people barely hear me . Or they hear with an strange echo . When i connect my phone with other headphones all is good when i switch to my Liberty 2 Pro people have problem hearing me"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,Every good stuff,For everyday music
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,"Great Sound, Punchy Bass! Awesome battery life","Great sound! Punchy Bass! The only issue I have with them is that I have to have the iPhone volume turned up almost full to have it loud enough. This leaves little room for adjustment but I’m ok with that. I only use them with my iPhone so I can’t talk about on other platforms. I really like them and give them a 4.5/5! There is an accompanying app that you can use to adjust the earbud sound to your liking. It even has a sound test you can take that will adjust the sound to your specific hearing, which is kewl! The sound is clear and mostly level. There is more bass than most earbuds which I love! I’m a bass person so this is great for me and was something i was worried about when first purchasing these. The highs are clear but not tingly. The mids are good and clear as well. Bass Rocks and does not distort the higher the volume. I’ve had the earbuds that come with the iPhone distort the higher I get towards max volume on the iPhone. These DO NOT DISTORT the closer you get to max volume. I wish I had more levels but it’s the max the iPhone has and the sound is great at that level. Noise cancellation is almost perfect. Many times my spouse has been talking to me and I don’t her at all lol. The battery life is great on these as well. At least 2 days standby and up to 32 hours (using the case to recharge them) play time. You also have a quick charge that allows you to get 2 hours out of only 10 minutes charge time. The earbuds are stylish but a little big. They sit nicely in the ear and lock in with a little rounded “arm”. U can and should adjust this little arm with the included ones for small medium and large sizes. The ones on the earbuds at purchase are the medium size. You can also change the earbud war “sponges”? For lack of a better word lol. To sum up: Great sound in the highs and mids with exceptional bass for an earbud. Great battery life and good noise cancellation make the low price worth it. These are in the mid range price wise at $150 but perform at the highest level. They have been compared to Bose as well. So if you want Quality sound with Bass and something that will last, grab these earbuds and enjoy the sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-09,GREAT PRODUCT!,Great sound! Love the help of the app. Notice I didn’t hear as well in my right ear as I thought and the app helped to balance the sound. Would definitely recommend!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-10,"Good, not great. Fall out easily.","These sound great but that's about it. I know that's what's important but there needs to be more for a set of buds that cost more than $100. They need to fit great too, and these don't. These fall out of your ear in lite to moderate activity. For $100, they need to stay in. You can also hear surrounding sounds and a hissing sound on low volume things like podcasts. These are also bulky so wearing beanies are out. Anker makes better buds for a lot less. Just buys those and not these. I recommend the neos. Great value and stay in tight."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-10,Soundcore is really stepping it up!,"These air buds sound amazing I just could not get them to fit my ears no matter what tip I used
UPDATE 12/12/2019. Soundcore reached out to me and has completely fixed my issue! What an amazing company! BEST COMPANY TOO DEAL WITH!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-10,Incredible sound,"Ive hand literally a hundred pairs of different type headphones. Most of them are good in one area and bad at other, for example, magnificent bass, bad high-end tones, and vice versa. I used to like more bass in my music so I always went with those types of headphones and I got used to hearing high and mid-tones a little bit suppressed. The first time I used the Liberty 2 Pros i felt a little bit strange cuz i wasnt used to having really good bass and also no vocal and high-end tones suppressed. It took me some time to get used to the true sounding of the music, how it's supposed to be heard. Truly amazing!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-10,They are great,Bought as a gift and she loves them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-12-10,Great sound and imperfected technology,The concept of Astria Coaxial armature is an interesting technology that looked great on paper but when in practicality its far from perfect. Now i am not completely critical to their approach I just wish they had taken more time to perfect it. I am a great a fan of Anker and own various other products and these disappointed me for the kind of performance delivery they promised. Now the headphones are not bad by long shot. The Soundcore Liberty Pro 2 sound really great and I like their Astria Coaxial Armature generated music with balanced treble and bass. but when you select the acoustic mode they start crackling. I thought that the one I got was a lemon being the early adopter that I was. But when I got the replacement pair they were the same. That's when I understood that the problem lies within the earphone themselves and it not an isolated problem. But set the EQ settings and the music is pleasurable to listen to. I personally like the slide case. Having a wireless charging case is a plus too. The ear fit also a bit troublesome but the multiple earbuds of varying sizes make it easy to find the right fit.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-10,"Better sound quality than those ""Airpods""","This is my first venture into the wireless earbud world, been holding off for a while due to my dislike of the Airpods, was not impressed by the sound quality of those things at all. First of all, these sound very close to my Revonext QT2S (Triple driver, 2 DD + 1BA), which were my benchmark in terms of sound quality, and I am very happy to have that sound quality coming from these wireless earbuds. I love my mids and highs with a little mix of heavy bass in my music so balance is key for me. These does the trick wonderfully, and I am very happy with these purchase. Not having to deal with wires is such a godsend and I didn't think I'd say that considering how long I put off buying wireless earphones, because I used to believe wired = best quality sound, which still holds true but these come very damn close!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-10,Great but they don’t connect to everything,I love them! The only this is the don’t connect to my 2 way radio. That’s what I bought them for🤷🏽‍♀️.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-10,"No hissing noise, great crisp sound.","For $109, I'm super impressed with these ear buds... They sound so clear! I was listening to music and in the song there was this glass breaking noise that sounded so real, I took my ear buds off and looked around to see what broke! Haha noise cancellation is decent even though it technically doesn't have this feature. I can report, no hissing/white noise. Love these earbuds!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-10,Very Happy with this purchase,"The sound quality is superb and very enjoyable. I am listening to much music because of those instead of broadcast. I hope they add the pass through mic and ANC next model. I think for the price specially right now 110 it's a very good deal . call quality is good but can improve a little. The sound quality wasn't that great when i connected them first, I rest the buds and reconnected them and it worked great, maybe I did something wrong, not sure. Highly recommended, worth every penny. I think this company will be very famous in the future specially if they keep there customer service this way."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-10,Great sound and quality,"I bought them for the expected battery life and is just on par with apple’s I am returning them as did not meet my expectations, they have good sound and come with different ear tips, they are not bad for workout but not for regular use on daily basis
*update
I was approached by their customer support and they even sent me a new pair to ensure my last unit was not faulty and together we completed a lot of testing unfortunately in my case if I use 1 earbud it last 8+ hours but if I use both at the same time (which is what most people do) the battery still lasts only about 5 hours which is not bad at all but not what I wanted, I am changing the rating because they truly wanted to help and worked with me, in the end they are not bad it earbuds at all it’s just they did not meet my expectations based on the product description reason why I am not giving 5star"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-11,Good audio quality with excellent battery life.,"I bought these after doing quite a bit of research. The sound is excellent considering the price. Highs and mids are not drowned out and are very clear. The lows are punchy without being overly emphasized. The noise cancellation is OK, considering it is just due to a good seal, (there is no active noise cancelling). But, they work very well considering. Overall, if you like good audio quality, an excellent fit, and phenomenal battery life, these are the ones for you."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-11,Surprisingly solid mid-range buds,"As a professional audio engineer and musician, these hold up surprisingly well with a couple minor issues. I do need to put a disclaimer that I've not used many consumer earbuds, and this is my first true wireless set. But that's to their credit in sound quality, since my main points of comparison then are my Alclair quad IEMs ($700) and Bose soundsport wireless ($180). I'd say noise isolation is pretty decent as long as you can find a tip with good seal and comfort, and that's pretty likely since they've included a lot of different shapes. Not as much rejection as my IEMs but plenty to enjoy music without external sounds bleeding in. It's easy to ignore the outside world but I'm not totally cutoff, perfect for running. Sound quality is of course also going to depend heavily on your ears. But I gotta say these things are pretty decent once dialed in for your ears. I found that the pop preset is most natural in quiet environments. If there's a lot of ambient noise I'll switch to the soundcore signature. In terms of volume, at 90% they're approaching discomfort so it's plenty for me, but I realize many people have less sensitive ears. Connectivity to both my LG V40 and both PCs is better than any Bluetooth audio device I've owned. I can walk downstairs and to the other end of the house with barely any noticeable interference. I've not had a chance to test battery life yet, but the bigger question is how long they will last before losing capacity. I'll update the review if they fail too soon. Build quality is all plastic but is quite good. The case is sturdy and the slide lid is well done with strong magnets. Having both wireless and USB-C charging is great. The case confirming connection with each bud is icing on the cake. Suffice to say the hardware is fantastic, but there's some gripes that, while not dealbreakers, I hope can be patched for an upgrade to 5 stars:
1. No custom EQ. It's very strange they specifically target the musician and audiophile crowds, then skip a major feature most relevant to that audience. HearID gets close but always ends up with too much difference between the ears. I need to be able to tweak the final results. I believe I read on the forum that manual eq is planned so we'll see. 2. When starting and stopping audio, the noise floor is somewhat noticeable. It disappears under music but for dynamic stuff like audiobooks I can still make it out. It's not enough to bug me but would be nice to be without. 3. You can't change the single tap action on the buttons, only double tap and hold can be changed (the single tap action is play/pause on both sides). Either option is painfully slow to adjust volume from the buds. Overall though I'm pretty happy with them. Solid wireless buds, and at an economic price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-11,Best for long run,"Pro : Sound is tune to please most of users. Suitable for pop music. iPhone sound better than Android. Excellent battery life. Wearing is comfortable. Suitable for jogging. Wireless charging is also very convenient. Con : Low background noise from right earbud is heard before music start. Noise is particular obvious when performing HearID profiling. This may affect the accuracy of the profiling. Besides, music crash sometimes in the left earbud when playing music."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-11,"Apple, Sony, Jabra, goodbye!!!!",I just got these so I can’t attest to the battery lite or noise cancellation just yet. Haven’t even downloaded the app yet but OMG!!!! I haven’t heard the beats yet but I had the Sony’s. Nothing!!! I mean nothing!!! Compressor to these headphones yet. Worth every penny. I’ll prob use these exclusively for travel depending on how they perform on the plane Saturday. The sound of these are incredible!!!!! You will not be disappointed!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-11,Great Earbuds...and NO HISS!!!!!,"I was patiently waiting for these just to see if there was this hiss / white noise issue. They were delivered earlier today and I’ve been on them all morning. I can gladly say that Anker must have rectified any early issues because these buds are simply amazing (without any low decibel hiss) at the $109-$149 price point. I have AirPods Pros, TOZO T6’s, Beyerdynamic DT770 80 Ohm and Audio Technica ATH-M50xBT’s and these Liberty 2 Pros fit nicely into my little collection. They are superb and NO HISS!!! I feel sorry for the folks who noticed and continue to notice this issue. I will say that they should contact Anker / Soundcore for a replacement or just grab new ones from Amazon. It would be worth just snagging a replacement pair. I called Anker to see if a human answers in a timely manner and I’m glad to also report that they have pretty good customer service without the long wait. Just get these!!! They are truly a great value!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-12,"Amazing , But a Slight Catch..............","so ive actually returned at least 5 pair of earbuds due to trying to find the right ""FIT"" right ""SOUND"" and most importantly right ""BASS"". I looked at all the reviews of people talking about other earbuds bought them and was disappointed, see i love bass! im a guy who puts speakers and subs in his car for that maximum bass! so when i tried these I was blown away , i know you hear alot of people saying that when they wear earbuds but sometimes they oversell it or they listen to music with out real bass , hiphop or trap music etc. NO THESE ARE AMAZING! i finally found the ones i like they fit perfectly the MIDS are good and the Highs! and its a APP to EQ them! i usually listen to the Setting of EQ on ""PIANO"" mode i dont know why this is the cleanest Preset for hiphop in my opinon
(PS , if you have a S8 or Note 8 or higher turn on ""DOLBY ATMOS"" in your drop down menu when you have them paired to the phone and watch the amazing sound get even better! THE CATCH
It claims you are getting atleast 8 hours on these, im only getting like 4 hours and then the left ear bud drains faster than the right for some reason , im not sure why its doing this maybe its just my pair , but its a little strange
im going to run more test to see but yeah dont like that! , they are a little bulky just a tad and looks like ""the old school blue tooth headsets lols
BUT I AM PLEASED! I GOT 2 FRIENDS TO BUY THEM A PAIR"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-12,My perfect earbuds,"I have had these earphones for a couple weeks now and i not dissatisfied i have tried a lot of earbuds but most either didnt fit property others the sound stage was dead awful... i must say these pros are the boss the sound stage surpasses epic proportions i would order another pair of these without reservation, these earbuds are the boss thank you soudcore you guys did it right i am a pleased customer"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-12,A bit buggy but good sound,"Out of the box the sound was clear, but lacked dynamics and bass. Replaced the silicon tips with Comply foam tips, et voila -- a massive improvement (but then Complys will make $30 no-name Chinese Bluetooth earbuds stomp all over AirPods). Also, the foam tips will help them stay in your ears. Has trouble connecting to certain devices that much cheaper and older buds have no trouble with, but works great with my phones. Also has a tendency to want to pair the left and right buds separately, which can be fixed by putting the buds in the case and pressing the reset button. Not a huge deal, but irritating. So-- not perfect, but better sound than AirPods and you'll look marginally less douchey wearing theim."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-12,They would be great if they fit better.,"I really wanted these to be great! I have a cheaper pair of Soundpeat earbuds and I love them for the price; only the battery life was too short. These buds were expected to be an upgrade. The battery life is good, longer than needed. The connection range is great, even here in my office. They connect reliably without having to reset the BT. The only complaint has been the fit. They stick way out of the ear and are not very stable. Too much movement or ear sweating and they will fall out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-12,Bass Heads Unite,I've had these for about a week now. I've tried about a dozen true wireless earbuds maybe more. I've lost count. The only one I've had that cost more is the Jabra Elite 65T. These blow those away. I have the Aukey T10's which are the same price right now. No contest. I don't have the hissing in my set others have reported. Download the app before you receive these. It makes all the difference in the world. If you want these for working out they may not be for you. I wasn't thrilled with the tip choices and put my JVC Victor Spiral Dot tips on them and wow. Clarity and bass united the sounds of the Gods. Perfect. I highly recommend these for music listening. I would use something smaller like the Aukey T10's or Enacfire F1's if and when I ever decide to jump back on my treadmill. All ears are different so these may work out fine for working out for you. Right now all I care about is the musical enjoyment these put out. Rock on!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-12,A must buy!,"These ear buds are punching way above their weight class. Amazing sound quality! The fit takes some getting use to but they stay in your ear without fail. They just stick out a bit. When you choose the extra bass eq in the app, BEWARE. On specific heavy bass songs I have found the buds clip slightly but this is only when that eq setting is chosen. There is more than enough bass and volume on the default setting. All in all these buds sound like they should be above the $200 range. The Momentums sound better but they are $300 you can get these with the instant coupon for $100ish."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-12,Quality!!,"I am an audio technician and have been for many years now these have a great quality of sound however, make sure you the listener pick the best earbud set for your ears to insure best quality can be heard! They are great though! Love the life of them to! Noise canceling is not bad at all for being passive. Active noise canceling would be yes better however, for the price they are great!.! And I would highly recommend them for sure! They are great! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-13,If you care about sound at all these are for you,"I won't lie the only reason i bought these at first is because i got it with a 40$ discount and if i absolutely didn't like them i'd be a complete Karen about it.... HOWEVER these are amazing! Pros:
*They come with 7 tips and wings so you're pretty much guaranteed to find the right size for you, not only that but they fit extremely well. I run and go to the gym really often and have had a very tough time with earbuds especially, wireless ones staying in. Happy to report that i haven't had any issues with these falling out at all. *There have been a few complaints that there is a low pitched ""hiss"" sound but i think this was an issue with the first batch that was sent out because the sound is incredible straight out of the box! plus they have an added equalizer in the app that makes them perform that much better and i haven't had any problems with sound. *The battery life is great and of course you get the wireless charging built into the case so it makes it really convenient. * The call quality in my case has been excellent! I drive a lot with my job and I've been able to have a clear conversation while on the road with no problems from the other person understanding me (except when of course i'm passing through a dead spot but that's mainly due to my phone provider than anything else)
cons:
*The earbuds are a bit bulky there's no better way to say it. They're not so big that it's distracting or anything but i just wish they had a more minimalist design. *NO AMBIENT AWARE MODE! ...yet. Soundcore has stated that they will release this feature with an update but honestly at this price point it's much more common and this would have honestly been nice to see. *I've had a few issues with connecting to my phone. it usually connects automatically by the time i just slide the case open however i've had issues where it doesn't connect at all and i'll basically have to put the buds back in the case, turn the blutooth on my phone completely off and wait a minute to try it again. Mind you the buds themselves are consistent about 95% of the time but when this issue does happen it's annoying because ive had several other pairs of wireless earbuds and this is the first time this has happened to me. All in all AMAZING earbuds, would highly recommend and are worth every penny."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-13,Hissing sound!,Terrible hissing sound hissing sound in background. Not secure enough fit to feel safe from losing them. Sound was decent but the noise cancelation wasn't good. Volume wasn't very high either. I would not buy these over competition one m
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-13,Crazy Good( Almost feels like Robbery),"If you catch these on sale with coupon this is an absoule no brainer. For any price. The clarity of the Mids and highs are better than earbuds I've listened to twice the full price. I've never experienced this problematic hissing on my OnePlus 7 T. The Mids and highs are pure joy, the low end will rock your world. If I had any complaints, it would be the companion app. It comes with lots of presets that actually do something, but it would be nice to shape the EQ exactly to what you want. While you can Map the fantastic click buttons on the buds. You shouldn't have to choose between volume, track and Voice Assistant. Anker I know you can do better. Over all a Home Run, especially when you consider the price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-12-13,Beta Tester,"Anker sent me a pair of these to beta test. I AM NOT a paid for my review. It was simply a perk for signing up with Anker on their website. That said, it was pretty sweet to get these for free! Pros:
The bass feature does indeed work well. The caveat? You must get a good seal in your ear. There are 3 different earpieces included but none actually fit my ears. I ended up using some that i had from my old Polk headphones. Once properly fit, the bass is quite good! Your mileage may vary but battery life was extremely good for me. Look, I'm older with perfect hearing so I protect it. Thus, i never played them very loudly and that tends to preserve battery life. I easily got 8 hours. Turning them up may drain them quicker. Connection. Once paired mine never had an issue with staying connected. I tested them with my Android phone and Kindle Fire. For me it was just set and forget. Case. I love that charging case! It recharges the earbuds multiple times before needing a charge. This means I can use them all day. Sweat proof. Before this i used a pair of older Anker Bluetooth earbuds with the wire connecting the ear pieces. The wire sucked and got in the way. Plus i was worried about ruining them with sweat as they weren't specifically sweat proof. These? No issues. I sweat like a banshee when running and they got wet but never had problems. Fit. Simply put, they feel pretty good and stay put. Cons:
Controls. The directions aren't very good and i had to contact Anker just to figure out how they work!! Once I knew how to properly control them it was ok...but i would have much preferred touch or gesture controls like my Sennheiser. But maybe that's asking too much for the price??? Fit. As mentioned, none of the ear pieces included workers quite right for me. I know they can't possibly fit everyone and 3 different sizes were included but still they didn't fit great. Without my older set that worked on these i would have been stuck with an iffy ear seal. Bass is dependent on ear seal. Bad seal? No bass. Range. It's fair but not very far. I don't really care as my phone was always on me but when i set my phone down and walked away the gave out kinda quickly. Conclusion. I still love these guys! I found a way to get a good seal so the bass is good, they stay put, don't break when i sweat, and are truly wireless. Yes, mine were free as a tester but I still think they are well worth the money. If you look at many review websites you'll find Anker headphones are becoming well known for quality at a great price. These are no different. Thank you Anker for letting me test."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-14,Not great for windy and noisy calls,I bought them for the clear call feature since it has 4 mics. Wanted to replace my Bose Quitecontrol 30 because their mic for calls is terrible. I usually made calls while in fairly noisy and windy environments. Unfortunately this earbuds were only a slight upgrade on the call side. On the audio side they are good but didn't found them particularly great. The wireless charging case is a great feature.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-14,"Good sound, nice looking and solid build.","[Sound]: Very good sound, deep bass and rich highs, with the app you can customize many eq modes, the only problem is the ""ssss"" sound in the background that can be noticed at low volumes. [Ergonomics] : The ear wings should be improved as it can be annoying for some people if you're not used to use it in side of the ear. [Battery]: Good battery life with quick charge feature. The battery case is lightweight and very portable. I think liberty pro 2 it is one of the best mid cost options (under $150 ) in the market among ""high-end"" true wireless earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-14,Awesome,Great
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-14,Excellent ear buds for music very good buds I'm very happy with sound and bass.,"Oh man I love these ear buds ,so much clean bass, and very loud ,I'm using with pixel 4 xl I love these things , great battery life and sound , and they are comforter and don't fall out, now there are alot of tips I learn that both ears are not the same size so make sure u take time to try all tips so they don't fall out not even at the gym ,the app is really good love these best choice I made in ear buds , the talking on phone quality is good ,but for music is where they shine also make sure u are using the high quality option in Spotify it makes a world of difference.. I have a sub system in my ride so I love bass and these buds do not disappoint.."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-14,Blown away!!!,"I have to say. I’ve NEVER been an ear bud kind of guy. These completely changed me. The hearID basically dialed these in perfectly! Taking a hearing test and then have the EQ set off of those results is fantastic. I even wore these on a flight and heard nothing, but the movie I was watching. My Beats studio wireless have been sitting in a box since."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-14,Ankers Above exceptional as always!,Some of the best sounding headphones ive ever used! One of the best brands I have ever bought from! There are multiple products I have bought and all have been amazing quality and amazing prices and lasted years upon years. You will not be disappointed by Anker or their soundcore division of there products
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-14,Amazing sound,These earbuds are amazing. I didn't like them at first but Anker went out of their way to make things right for me. I love Anker products and how much they care about their customers.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-14,Sound better than airpods,"When you get these, you need to setup the EQ. Spend the 3 minutes and use the Hear Eq setup wizard. Once you do that the app will adjust the eq for your ears. These headphones sound great! Bass sounds very good. Overall very clean and crisp frequency response. I own the Soundcore Life NC, Liberty Air 2 and finally the Liberty Pro 2. All the Anker products I own sound great. The Life NC was the loudest pair I had but now that I have the Liberty Pro 2 they are my go to. The 11mm driver sounds so damn good. These sound better than the airpods pro and airpods v1 and v2. IF YOU CAN AFFORD THESE, BUY THEM. I'm going to buy a second pair for my GF next week. I had to warranty my Life NC due to water damage that was my fault, anker sent me a new pair of headphones within 3 days. All anker products have a 18 month warranty and they're good about warranty returns."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-14,"Incredible Sound, Ruined by Annoying Background Hiss on Three Pairs So Far","I am super torn over this review because these buds sound incredible. At least on par with the Sony WF-1000XM3 in almost every aspect. They have very similar sound signatures. However. I'm on my third pair and all three have had very annoying background hiss/white noise. I just received the ""revised"" version where they supposedly updated the hardware, but the white noise is still there. Anker support has been great, but that doesn't help when the product itself is faulty. These should be a 5/5, but the hissing issue severely impacts the experience."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-15,Audiophile level sound,Once you get it set up with the ear test app and the firmware updates these are the best BT earbuds I have heard in my life! These... THESE!... are absolutely awesome.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-15,Awesome Wireless Earbuds!,"I have tried probably half a dozen different wireless bluetooth earbuds, most recently the Jabra Elite 65t. All had their good points but were lacking in various ways. The Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro are the best of the bunch and I think my search is over. They are not the smallest ones, but that is a trade-off I'm willing to make to get this level of sound quality and battery life. The Soundcore app provides tons of EQ options and customization of the buttons. Speaking of the buttons, I think the design of putting the buttons on the top of the earbuds such that you can ""pinch"" the earbud to activate the button instead of ""push"" the button (and the earbud into your ear) is a great design. The included fins and eartip options are extensive. First pair of earbuds I haven't felt I needed to get foam tops for. Sound quality is awesome! Base is deep and crisp with good ""slam"" when it's there in the song. Yet the highs are still crisp and present. Very enjoyable to listen to. Does well on a variety of music too! Highly recommended!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-15,nice,listened to sounds good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-12-15,Amazing sound quality,"Great headphones! Very unique opportunity to do a kind of hearing test to get a specific sound profile. The quality of the sound is superb and they cancel out background noises too. They do stay in my ear well, which can be tough to do with intense workouts. They’ve lasted me awhile and no issues thus far."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-15,Sound awesome without the hiss.,"I took a chance on these with all the comments about hiss or white noise. The pair I received has neither. As soon as I connected them to the app, there was a firmware update. Maybe that corrected the issue everyone complained about. I also own a pair of Bose wireless earbuds and these sound just as good or even better. The only problem I have with these is finding that combination to fit in my ears that stay in comfortably. I would recommend these for the price. They sound amazing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-16,Super Great Earbuds,"These EarBuds have a great sound i just wish it has a 6 band usable sound equalizer Included to Taylor the music to our preference and Not Presets , i Downloaded to my iPhone a 10 band equalizer app with Bass and Volume boost and oh Boy , this Liberty 2 Pro , sounds much much bassy Is like having a Subwoofer Down to 20Hz in your ears and much louder , the High frequency does not interfere with the Lows , but enjoy my music at low Volume , and i don't hear a hiss at low volume as other reviews mention it , probably the new Update fix it"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-12-16,Bluetooth terrible,newly released firmware update (12/17/2019) seems to have addressed some of the issues. Bluetooth connectivity is still an issue though
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-16,Buy now. You can find discount codes for $40 off,"I love the sound quality, the fit is good, battery life is great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-16,They have good mic quality as well along with bass and high,I gotta say these are by far the best True wireless earbuds . These are straight champs at first they sounded weird and made a popping sound out of the signature setting but once it did a 2nd update it fixed all the problems so give it a few updates this took about 4-5 days of use . They got really good bass . And the highs are really good . The call quality sounds good from what I'm told .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-16,Great Sounding earbuds,Wow! I was and am blowned away by the sound of the ear buds! They are definitely worth every penny! Love the hear id so you can taylor the sound to your specific ears!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-16,The sound quality is the key factor for these and the app helps find that sound for you,My new fav the sound is amazing these are the real deal the bass is amazing and the highs and mids sound perfect the only thing I would complain is wish they had a better water rating and they took a while for me to find the right buds but other then that I love them highly recommend them
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-16,Amazing Earbuds,"I hate low quality sound, but this one wins it! For those that dont fit in their ear please check out the manual it tells you how to use it right."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-17,These are great.,"Super sound stage, esp after calibration. Comfortable after changing silicone tips to fit properly. Great battery life. Range (in a cheap, gypsum board American home), is fantastic. Don't care what they look like."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-17,It Kicks Ass!!!,"These work and, most importantly, sound great!!! Love em!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-17,Best headphones I have owned.,"I love the coaxial setup. And being able to fine tune the eq just to your ear is amazing. My only disappointment is that they are not noise cancelling. But other than that, best set of headphones I have ever had."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-17,Good sound BUT with major flaws...,"Where do I start.....
Ok the design is brilliant! Love the look and feel. Very comfortable to wear. Tight seal, and that is key! The sound is very very good, well above the price class. Soundcore app is ok. Nothing special but definitely needed to get most out of buds. Lacks a true EQ but kinda makes up for it with HearID. Still wish true EQ was available tho. These buds are clear and loud with very defining bass. Sound like subs in your ears lol. Packaging is the best I've ever seen for earphones. The packaging alone is worth a purchase. Other manufacturers need to take note! My issues start with battery life. Anker claims 8hr per charge but that is not entirely accurate. You can get 8-10 hrs life but only one bud at a time. Let me explain....
These use a master/slave set-up. The right earbud is the master, the left bud connects to the right. So while yes you can use either the left or right bud, only one is the master and the other the slave. It puts a crazy battery drain on whichever is the master bud. And I'm talking 60% difference crazy! So usually after 4 or so hours, the right bud is down to less than 20% and the low battery warning is going off in the right bud all the while the left bud is >80%! So once you put the right bud in the case to charge, the left bud takes over independently and you continue on with listening. After 4 or so hours,... Rinse and repeat. I believe there could be an update to allow for independent pairing like the jaybird Vista or the Sony buds. Anker soundcore responded to my emails but just offered an exchange but no real fix. I had the jaybird Vista and battery life was a consistent 5-6 hrs. Per bud!! I will be returning these sad to say. I will be returning to Amazon be today. They should have gone with independent connection, truly makes a difference. Would have been best iem of the year."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-17,"Great for music, calls","I'll jump to the con: they do ever so slightly hiss. It's not a dealbreaker at all for regular use. It's very, very low level. Maybe if I had the ears of an 18 year old this would bother me. :) I wouldn't use them or any other Bluetooth setup for mixing but hey, some great mixes have been made to sound great on a boombox, so maybe..
My work involves a lot of remote meetings, sometimes hours a day. Everybody says they can hear me clearly -- these are the only earbuds that has been true of. I can be in meetings for hours and these are comfortable and the battery life is plenty. They also recharge quickly, and pair very quickly. The range is unexpectedly good. The sound quality for music is also great. I have been very impressed. I wish they'd pair with my phone AND my laptop without jumping around but that's really just a nit pick."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-17,These sound fantastic and last longer before charging than most.,Love these earbuds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,Great all around,"Extremely good earbuds, fit nicely in ear, very long battery life, some of the best buds you can get"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,Great,This was a gift and he seems to like them
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,The New Bluetooth In Ear Monitor King,"I will start by saying I thought the 10 Award Winning Grammy Endorsement was just a sales tactic to get consumers to buy their new headphones. I thought the price was reasonable at $149.99, this was before the Holiday discount coupon came in to play getting them down to $109.99 making the deal that much sweeter. I went ahead and purchased them to see if they were as good as they claim. To my absolute enjoyment they sounded incredibly good and I was honestly surprised that everything they were saying was true about the accuracy of the lows, mids and highs at any volume level without distortion. That is a very difficult thing to have all the sound dynamics be available and on display no matter what level the volume is set to. I can be a couple clicks from totally turned down and still have the same sounds at mid and max volume levels. I use Amazon HD for streaming so I am streaming my music at the highest possible quality for reference. I also own the Sony WH-1000XM3 and Sennheiser (M2) Over Ears to test out the music I was hearing and the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pros were coming out on top. I then had to go to what the Internet claims to be the 2 best sounding True Wireless In Ear Monitors, The Sony WF-1000XM3 and the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless. I can quickly tell you the Sony’s were decent, but nothing special and because I already have noise cancelling there was no added value this was purely based on sound. Next up where the Sennheiser Momentum true Wireless… and these things due sounds good with a nice sound stage all coming from (1) 7mm dynamic driver in each In Ear Monitor. Once you get the EQ setting just right there are pretty damn good. So now that I have tested the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pros against Over-Ear and In Ear Monitors from Sony and Sennheiser that double if not triple in most cases the competition the sound is absolutely hands down better in every way than all of the of the above mentioned headphones I either own or have tested. The EQ setting that I personally enjoy the most for any music genre or movie that I am listening to or watching is “Acoustic” it seems to have that little something extra and gives a more expansive soundstage that matches or betters the Sennheiser to maximum me enjoyment of the product. I don’t know how they have done it but to offer These In Ear Monitors for 149.99 or 109.99 on sale that have (8 hours battery life per bud; Mono listening L or R; IPX4 sweat/water resistant; 24 hour Qi Wireless Charging Case, USB-C Wired charging; Quick Charge… 10 minute charge in the case gives you 120 minutes of play time; Bluetooth 5.0 I can get at least 90 feet away from my phone before any drop in music; Quad Microphones for Clear Phone calls ; Personalized Hear-ID EQ; Great Preset EQ Settings; and the star of the show… (2)Knowles Balance Driver, and (2) 11mm sub- drivers) I call them 11mm sub-drivers because the difference is these are not over done bass that bleed all over the mids and the highs. Whatever the producer wanted you to hear when they produced this music or movie is what you here and the exact way you are supposed to hear it… period. I can only say this has to be because of their “ACAA” Astria Coaxial Acoustic Architecture that brings all this sound together in total harmony. Being completely transparent I must tell you this is my second pair of these amazing In Ear Monitors. If you look through these reviews or watch some reviews on YouTube you will more than likely see or hear that some of the folks that got the early version of these monitors, myself included whenever there was no music playing or low volume sound playing you could hear this type of white noise sounds. If you have the volume at 50% or higher this sound would fade away and not detract from the audio you were listening to. I have purchased Anker products in the past and with Soundcore being an Anker product line and knowing they World Class customer service, I decided to put them to the test. I reached out to a Customer Service Department and was put in contact with “Hayley” and “Beauty” and they assured me they would take care of me after they confirm I have the original batch that had this background hiss at lower volumes. The reason they confirmed this was because most places require that you send the product back in exchange for the replacement item… to my surprise for the inconvenience they sent me out once they had my replacement in stock the update version that sounded the exact same as the first once but without the low volume hiss. That is what great customer service looks like.. So in the end I have 2 pairs of In Ear Monitors that easily better they Sony and Sennheiser in every way for half the price. Would highly Recommend these for anyone looking for the best overall Bluetooth In Ear Monitors Regardless Price or OS"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,Best I’ve heard in TWS earbuds!,"These are the best I’ve heard in earbuds. They have great sound,good details and sound stage. Only thing I wish they had is a little more volume. Another 5 or 10 dB. would be nice. I like the case as well and Qi charging and USB-C cable."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,Best TWS I’ve ever had!!!!,"I have owned several different earbuds over the years and these are the best hands down. I have Powerbeats which are just boomy, I’ve had the lypertech tevi which are good, these are just better. I love the fact that I can play these at low volumes and still get rich full sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,Very comfortable,1 of the best .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,Must Buy if it’s on sale,It’s cool and y’all but might not be worth full price. If on sale I would buy.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-18,The sound and look,Great sound for the price
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-19,Amazing sound for earbuds. Not greatest comfort,"I don't really have much to say. I'm not an audiophile. I am just really big into bass and the bass at this size is amazing based on the few earbuds I've purchased in the past. My biggest complaint is the lack of comfort. They start hurting my ears after about 10 minutes and it becomes annoyingly noticeable. I have some Jabra Elite Pro 65t's and they are amazing in my ear. Don't even know they are there. I think it has to do with the angle of the device. To keep them in my ear I need the ""flanged"" rubber pieces but since they are angled out very far, I have to bend them inward and when they tuck in my ear, they pull that big round plastic part of the housing to press hard against my ear, instead of contouring to my ear shape like the Jabras do. However, I will never get rid of these because the sound is too amazing. I just wish they would have prioritized testing comfort a bit more. Would have gotten a 5-star rating if they had just gotten one more aspect right."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-19,Nice but with flaws,It sounded nice and has a lot of bass yet trebles are good too. The middles are lacking a bit. However the bigger issue is I just can’t get it to fit in my ear because the stem where the ear tip is attached to is too small therefore it wobbles in my ear canal and can’t stay securely. It already drops connection with my phones bluetooth several times already. To be fair I don’t hear the white noise that other reviewers are talking about. Call quality is average. It makes me sound like a robot. I really wanted to keep it but too bad it’s going back.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-19,Read a REAL REVIEW FROM A 3 MONTH OWNER!!,"I usually dont like doing reviews bc i buy so much on Amazon. But I had to pause for station identification. These headphones are hands-down the best headphones I have ever had. And I have spent top-notch money on headphones because I love music so much because of how music makes me feel. In these headphones, the vocals are superb, Adele sounds like you're at her concert. Hip hop bass that makes you think you have speakers in your trunk. Rock and roll music that makes you feel the electric guitar from Angus of AC/DC. The only thing that I will ask you to do is take the time to find what ear plugs & wingtips works best for you. Like for me I have one of the clear red ones and one of the longer black ones in the other. I have a very very comfortable fit but each ear can be different. For comfort, I literally could wear these 4-5 hours easy. When you have spent some time selecting the right wing tip for each ear you will have no issues with these maintaining in your ear canal. I wear these to run, work, workout/boxing gym, and even the steam room. I have yet to have one of them fall out unless I physically hit it accident. In your head you just want to touch them but you really don't need to. These buds do a tremendous job blocking out outside noise with the music on a pretty low volume. And I love volume by the way and you don't have to crank these as nearly to the peak for you to have great loud music. Battery life is not even worth me spending time on because I have yet to get a low battery signal. Because by the time that I get through wearing them for quite some time, I have no problem charging it just because it's been a while. Speaking of charging the case is great and can easily fit in your pocket, coat, or purse. Its sleek and has a short charge time. 10 min gets you 2 hrs of play time. I fly alot alot, so knowing 10min gets 2 extra hours in the air is huge. Lastly, go download the app so you can setup your button functionality. You can dictate volume, song skip, pause/play. DON'T 2ND GUESS THESE AT ALL, BUY THEM RIGHT NOW & GET THEM IN 2 DAYS...HAHAHA!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-19,Quality,These are very nice ear buds that perform perfectly plus you can customize by doing an ear test for sound to match your hearing ability and improves the equalizer as needed.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-19,Fantastic!!!,These buds sound wonderful and the battery life is great!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-19,Sound quality,The best buds ive ever owned. Luv the hearing test profile set up.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-19,"Sounds great, good price, comfortable.","So after watching a tech reviewer (Flossy Carter) I knew I had to get these. I had the Bose soundsport free and these a WAY better. Clear sound, bass hits hard. Nicely done ANKER!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,0,2019-12-19,Glitches,"IMO there's a reason these have dropped in price so soon after introduction. Yes, when they work properly, they sound great. Unfortunately, in my experience, two different pairs I tried both had the same problem: every eighteen seconds, I would hear a click, followed by the left/right phasing going out of whack. Then the phasing would normalize, and all would be well for another seventeen seconds...
I worked with Soundcore to resolve the problem, but as of this writing, they were unable to supply me with a pair that worked properly. Most unfortunate. Was it some kind of incompatibility with my LG Android 5 phone? I don't know, but I have tried quite a number of BT buds and cans with that phone and not had any kind of problem. So make sure the seller will take these back if you encounter any issues..."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2019-12-20,"Dangerous, flawed HearID function, ear buds have unimproved sound performance","First: I have the older Zolo Liberty Plus earbuds. They isolate outside noise much better than do these Liberty 2 Pro's. I like the case of these new Liberty 2 Pro better as it is much lighter, has wireless charging and uses USB C. Putting the earbuds back in however is a pain the butt. With the Zolo's it is very obvious which direction to place the earbud so they fit and charge. That is not the case with these Liberty 2 Pro's. Setting them in in the right direction takes much more effort. The sound is not any better than the Zolo's from what I can tell. And the sound isolation, which is important given the lack of active noise cancelling, is no where near as good as the Zolo's. The App: I used the Soundcore app on Android, the company's corresponding app to help sync the earbuds and control the EQ. The app looks good and is functional and easy to use. Given the lack of improvement in the sound department I figured I'd try the company's ""custom"" sound feature, HearID. You go thru the function on the app and it plays a series of sounds for you to say when you can hear them. This feature has a MAJOR and DANGEROUS flaw. I keep the media volume to about 30% when listening to ear buds/headphones. That is where the sound level was before I tried the HearID feature. The feature must have something where it cranks the volume to 100% for it's sound customizing with the really high pitched and deep sounds it plays. I did not change the volume myself and was not warned that the app was changing the volume for media on my Galaxy Note 10 +. Once the HearID process finished I switched to the Google Play Music app and played music to see how the sounds customizing worked/changed the sound. The volume was unbearable. I yanking the earbuds out as fast as I could but it played at 100% volume for a few seconds which was enough to cause my ears to ring constantly. Trying to sleep the next night was very challenging in a quiet room because my ears were not ringing loudly. I returned the defective and dangerous product. I also called Anker to complain about the issue. They were only mildly interested. The rep said they documented the concern. They did not ask for details so I don't feel like they will try to reproduce or fix the issue. This will be the very last Anker earbud product I buy. I hope the ringing my ears subsides. Be careful using the HearID function with this product! Update: One week later and my ears still Ring constantly, thanks for the hearing loss Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-20,Sound amazing.,"Best Earbuds that I have used, great sound!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-20,Passed expectations,"I've tried a couple other earbuds, but they fell short on quality and sound. These do not. The sound is crisp and clear, and I can get that extra bass that I like. Call quality is great. I can still be understood even with a lot of background noise."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-20,Solid ear buds but control app needs work,"Over all I am very happy with these ear buds, the static in the background when no music is playing was noticable but I quickly stopped hearing it after listening to them. The app used to adjust the eq and update the ear buds is not the best as I can't update them. It keeps telling me that I have to connect both ear buds even when they are both connected."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-20,Great Wireless Earbuds for the price!,"I recently got them on sale so the price was great no matter what. If you've ever used a set of Bluetooth anything a the set up is pretty direct. Using them day to day was even easier. The app it comes with to help set up your own personal profile is highly recommended, with it the tones tend to favor the higher end. When I got my calibrated the bass sounded tighter and made any song with vocals sound cleaner than most wireless earbuds I've used. I wish the fit was better thought, the way the ear hooks are shaped aren't the best. They rest on ears in a way that does make really long listening sessions very comfortable and I wish the charging case was smaller, because having them in your pocket doesn't feel all that amazing. Other than the awkward for (could just be me) and the bulky case it's otherwise a perfectly amazing set of earbuds. The sound quality is amazing. USB C is great and wireless charging is convenient."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-20,Near Perfect Sound,"Says it on the title.. Just wish I could have more control in the EQ settings controlling each set frequency in Bass, Treble, Mids, and Highs to create my own sound signature manually. Battery life I get 7h 10ms on average depends on sound intensity, example podcast, music, books, and/or movies. The hissing is not as bad what others make out to be, your getting these for the beautiful sound not to listen out for a hiss."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-20,"Pricy, but worth it",Best ear phones I have ever owned
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-20,Left Earbud Dead Out of the Box,"All of the reviewers on YouTube said that these were the ones to get, especially for the sales price. They were very comfortable to wear and I loved the design. But the left earbud wouldn't pair no matter what I did so back they went. Update 1/15: They have added a personal equalizer option, gone is the sibilant sound. The software issues are gone. I now rate these a 5/5! Customer service is 5/5, buds are 5/5, price is 5/5...highly recommended!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-21,"Overall good product, just watch they don't fall out!","Like the sound quality. Love the app with EQ settings and button management! Dislike size, as clothing and exercise tend to make them fall out. Dislike charging tray as it seems it's battery gives up the ghost way faster than advertised."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-21,Excellent sound!,"These earphones are soooooo good! When they say studio sound, they weren't kidding. I am very impressed with these! They came fully charged and ready for use. Took me a bit to figure out their operation but, I am very satisfied with them!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-21,for the price its amazing,"to quote Flossy Carter, this is a major major major go"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-21,"These are the Buds Your Looking For, WOW WOW WOW","I have many over the ear phones and wireless earbuds. I like them all for one reason or another, however, I read about these and decided to give them a try. I put them up against all my other earbuds and they just blew them all away. The sound is amazing. They fit in the ear great and stay in place even with headshakes, no issues. The bluetooth range is excellent. The packaging is wonderful and I like how the case slides open instead of a flip and the wireless charging is a major plus for me. The Soundcore app is easy to use and directed me to update the firmware which took 5 min or so. Then I did the sound test to personalize my earbuds. There are 22 setting in the app covering all types of music and also if listening to podcast, radio etc. Talking on the phone is great crisp and clear but have only done so indoors. If your on the fence these are worth every penny. I have an iPhone 11+ for personal use and Samsung Note 10+ for work and the app is easy to use on either phone and the sound is amazing. UPDATED 12/24/2019 5+ Stars... These connected easily to my Samsung TV and can play all my XBOX games with these earbuds on, matter of fact anything I can put on the TV I can listen with these buds. Some mornings I get up very early for work but could never turn on the tv due to wife sleeping as I wanted to watch the news, weather, etc. With these I can connected to the TV, done...gaming late at night or early done...nobody gets woken up. Games like Fallout sound as if im there with the wind, rain, thunder, footsteps, birds etc. Recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-21,Great ear-buds,"You can tune these buds to your own hearing sensitivity - this is great for people with hearing loss. They sound great, connect to an iPhone 11 easily and are comfortable to wear. They only thing they don't have is active noise cancellation."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-22,Unexpected excellence!,"Used daily and in a very hot sweaty ear. Very comfortable, stable in ear fit, recommend comply foam tips to enhance bass and in ear retention improvement. Gotten 8-9 hours on a charge at a very high volume. Only one pairing hiccup with iPhone 8+ when new, now perfect after 1 month. App is very intuitive, personalized ear testing and synthesized sound odd and Sound was muted and horrible. LOVE piano, rock and pop though. I’ve owned newest Sennheiser, Beats and Bose and for the price and for the average non audiophile listener these are a absolute steal!!! I’ve owned a few Anker portable battery items and was impressed with build quality, materials and fit and finish. These are no different. Slowly making my way into the premium wireless earbud market from rather high end wired models typically tethered to a small Fiio amp, I can only say that I do miss the urge to REALLY crank a particular song, but that’s it. I found the sound loud enough, punctuating the frequencies that matter and with the comply foam tips the passive nouse reduction is really quite good. Honestly one of the best tech purchases I’ve made in a long, long time. And oh yah, the charging case is small and opens in a very cool way. Bravo Soundcore ! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-22,Support quickly resolved my issue with these great headphones!,"Purchased these headphones and noticed the small hiss/static at low volumes. I reached out to support and had a fantastic experience! They were not only easy to work with but helpful, straight forward, and quick at getting me a new pair of headphones that don't have the issue! I continue to buy Anker and Anker company products because their products are great and if you have an issue you will get great service to resolve the issue!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-22,Best I've heard for under $150,"The detail of these headphones blew me away the first time I heard them. I tried every style of music I like at them and they didn't disappoint. Worth every ""DAMN"" penny!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-22,Worth it,Simply amazing. I'm impressed
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-22,Must buy.,UNBELIEVABLE value for so many features. It's a $300 sound for sure.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2019-12-23,"APP BREAKS FUNCTION,FIRMWARE ISSUES, LEFT ISSUES.","UPDATE-So the Original set that updated fine that I had disconnect of left bud and poor sound left bud. Between email support, which is useless, and trouble shooting myself. Seems like the problem for me as a lefty. I use the left only for most of the day and add right and then just left again. So it seems to be a issue with making left the primary instead of right. Possible fix with app, but for me running without app installed is the best experience. My tests, 9am-6pm work test. Battery last all day, also disconnect happen with batter over 60%. Day1- left bud start with app installed. Get poor sound and just disconnected but my iPhone XR still playing music. (Amazon HD)
Day2- left bud start WITHOUT app. Good sound and no disconnect. Day3-right bud start with app. Good sound and no disconnect
Amazon replaced my first set. Pairing and sound issues. Got the replacement and sound and pairing seem better,BUT errors trying to update from 1.09 to 1.22. Amazon won’t replace again just refund, so waiting for Anker support. Also what’s up with right battery discharging faster than left? Add picture. Looks like it does support Amazon HD up to 24bit 44.1kHZ."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-23,"True Wireless Earphones built with attention to detail in Sound quality, features and built to last.","This is the first anker product i've owned, but i've purchased headsets for family members and a friend, all of whom got great consistent usage out of them. in 2 cases they still are, after 2 years. When the Soundcore liberty 2 pro was released, i saw a lot of good feedback on it so after a while, decided to give it a shot. The packaging. Honestly, when it comes to packaging; i'm just happy if a product comes and isn't damaged and is packaged well. But i have to say, this unboxing was really cool. To the point where i actually gave it some thought when i'd otherwise just figure out how a box needed to be opened and then remove the product. This just has an old time wooden box like feel to it as you open everything. inside, are the Earpieces of course, the charging case, a sheet of various tips in different sizes, all of which are pretty high quality i'd say, 3 different sized earwings, the user guides and a USB-C cable of a good length, and also a velcro strap like you might see on a laptop charger. This is the first headphone of any kind where i've seen something like that on the charging cable. A really nice touch on Anker's part. The pair i recieved came with the medium earwings and medium tips attached. I got a decent fit with this combination, but ended up switching to the smallest tips and wings, and i was able to get a great fit. once you have the tips and wings that will fit you best, place the earpieces in your ear and twist them into place. With a good fit, i'm able to twist them forward so they're pointed mor vertically or twist them back and they're mor horizontal. The sound can change slightly in both instances, but not in a way that will drasticly alter whichever sound setting you might choose in the app. i have a good enough fit that these provide great passive isolation, but the tips don't go so far in my ear as to cause a vacuum like effect. These are pretty comfortable and i truthfully am surprised they fit this well. i love the style, the build reminds me of the Sony WF 1000XM3 which i got an adequate fit with, but couldn't wear longer than an hour or so and even then it wasn't the most comfortable fit either. The buttons for the liberty 2 Pro are brilliantly placed. They sit on the top edge of each earbud facing outward. This is appreciated because with these, i don't have to try to hold an earpiece with 2 fingers, while pressing a button so the earpiece doesn't become lodged in my skull. okay a little dramatic no doubt, but there is something to be said for not having to worry about the fit of the earpiece moving while your using the buttons for volume, track navigation etc.
Speaking of which, by default; these buttons do the following. press and hold for 3 seconds brings up your voice assistent, 2 presses of the left earpiece rewinds a track, 2 presses of the right fastForwards, and 5 seconds powers the earpieces off. you can call up your device's assistent by holding either of the buttons for 3 seconds, and when you hear a beep, release the button and speak your request. In the Soundcore app, you can change the functionality of the buttons. E.g. instead of calling your assistent up, you might choose to have this function determine volume control. Within the app there are a number of sound presets to choose from, ranging from Flat to spoken word, Piano, jazz, Pop, Rock Club etc.
i ended up settling on the bass reducer setting. The default sound signature has way to much bass for my liking, even for the bassiest of tracks. none of the rest of the spectrom is drowned out per se, but there was just to much and not very well controled bass. i've heard looser bass to be sure, this just stood out mor prominently because regardless of what sound preset i tested, there is part of the mid range that is kind of lifeless for lack of a better description. It feels present, although briefly; but then fizzles out almost immediately. It isn't a major distraction, but i definitely notice it at times. Also the mids do feel slightly muted in some instances , though this seems to lessen the mor i use them. Even with the bass reducer setting however, i had to place the earpieces back in the case and pull them out a couple times because the bass went down but not a ton. occasionally i still have this problem, but it's never been as prevelent as it was the first time i had to do this. Otherwise, they'd be going back for sure. The sound on these is really steller. The drivers are quality; and even though the bass can be over done, it doesn't rear it's head when it isn't called for. E.g. on classical pieces, your not hearing the bass trying to find a spot for itself in the mix. This is in part likely due to there being multiple drivers in each earpiece. Which is not necessarily common in a product like this being True Wireless not to mention many products with multiple drivers can cost a lot more..
on any given day it's not uncommon for me to listen to Metal, HipHopp, Jazz, Classical, Prog rock, Alternative, indi choral, instrumental, podcasts, audiobooks etc. all the music i listenen to shines on these in 1 way or another. Whether it's the hard hitting bass in a great beat, the melodic sound of a guitar solow, dynamic percussive sounds or even an audiobook, everything has it's place with these earphones. They are just a lot of fun to listen to. They also work really well for calls as well, even if i got a good distance from my phone. it's also worth pointing out that these do work in mono mode as well. yes a lot of newer true Wireless models do fortunately, but since there are some that don't, it's important to call this out. fun fact, if you don't have the case for these with you, they can stick together with the magnets on them that would otherwise hold them in the case. Because of the intermittent issues i have with bass showing up from time to time in a higher quantity than i normally have with these earphones, i contacted Anker customer support. i mentioned earlier that i'd purchased several neckband headsets from anker previously, and when 2 of them had issues, customer service was quick to replace them. i'd seen online that there have supposedly been 3 revisions of these liberty 2 pros, and had also seen posts where people mentioned they were able to get a replacement shipped to see if it still exibitted the same issues as the first set they'd purchased. E.G. Hiss, which these don't have a ton of, or really loud volume which these definitely do. Which if i had to guess, could lead to the hiss and or extra helping of bass. In my email, i explained which version of the soundcore app i was using, and that when i tried to update the app i got a message saying my app was up to date. I also mentioned that i'd tried various EQ settings, had completely reset the earpieces and re paired them and tried all this on 2 phones prior to my email, and her response to my troubleshooting was to do what i'd already done again. literally saying things like, be sure your app is up to date, and stating which version. i'd also mentioned that i knew that version was available, based on their website but that my app said it was up to date. She also suggested trying other sound presets different from the one i'd chosen, even though i'd mentioned i'd done this, In short, troubleshooting with her seemed like a losing battle. it's one thing to miss a detail someone brings up while speaking maybe on a phone call, but my troubleshooting steps were written out. IF something else goes wrong which i hope not obviously, i'll definitely reach out again. But this was not good customer service for sure. And i say that because it was like she didn't even read what i'd written. If there are other steps i can take to get this fixed i'm definitely down to try, but having me try what i've already mentioned i've done especially when i've detailed it, is not going to solve the issue. But speaking not about my customer service experience, but about the liberty 2 Pro specificly, If you're looking for a great all arounder that can hold up to the riggors of daily life on the go, has a long battery life, with a pocketable case that charges wirelessly as well as USB-c, then the liberty 2 Pro are definitely worth considering."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-23,Better than AirPods Pro,Everything is really amazing only thing that I don’t like is the voice when you power it on
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-23,Great ear buds,I got this.for my husban for Christmas and he really likes them. He likes that they fit and they are super comfortable. He also really likes that they are really noise cancelling.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2019-12-23,No static after firmware upgrade,"I only just received these and tried them out for a bit. I ordered directly from the website, as I have some other Anker stuff I like. The package arrived quickly via USPS priority mail. The instructions were pretty clear. The soundcore app installed and ran without issue on my Android phone (Moto E5 play running stock Android 8.0). Pairing worked fine. I have a few other Bluetooth headphones and earphones, but these are my first earbuds without a cord between them. I did hear a bit of static initially, but not after the firmware upgrade (1.22), which the guided me through pretty easily. I tried out the HearID thing : kind of cool idea, it is basically like one of those hearing tests where you press a button until you can't hear the sound anymore, which I guess it uses to figure out the frequency response of your ears. We'll see how well that works. I like that you can also customize the double-tap and long-press (1 second) behavior of the buttons. I never use the assistant and I like to be able to tweak the volume quickly, and being right handed I think of right side being positive and left negative (sorry southpaws :)
I only plan to use these with my phone, not my tablet or work laptop, and anyway I have other Bluetooth devices for those, so the pairing restrictions are not a deal breaker. The charging case is neat, have not used one of these before. I typically use larger sized earpads, no surprises with these. I will update this review after a while to see how the battery life and sound quality holds up."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-23,Great,"Great ear buds, bought 4 pairs to give as gifts"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-23,Very good music quality ❤️,Awesome music quality 💕💕💕
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-23,Best earbuds I’ve used so far.,"*Sound*
The buds are phenomenal once you get it set the way you want it. You can tell Anker/Soundcore want you to have the best experience and are aware that not one set of tips for your ear will be perfect so they provide you with everything to customize your fit. The stock tips were ok but the sound was really thin so I switched them out with some bigger ones that they provided to fit my ears better. Once doing this the sound was AMAZING. Very deep rich bass that has highs and mids sharp enough to cut through it giving a full body sound. Nothing appears to be suffering in these. *Pairing*
There is virtually no lag and the pairing process is simple as taking them out of the case and putting them in your ear. Once you put them back they start charging back up and turn off. I would compare the pairing to being as easy as the air pods for Apple devices. *The app*
The app works wonders on finding the right sound for you. It has you take a test to see which sound frequencies you’re most sensitive to and which ones you’re not and it made a huge difference on the sound quality. *BATTERY*
The battery life is UNREAL.. I have used these every single day since I bought them and charged them the fully the first day I got them and have not charged the case since...😳. *Noise cancellation*
its passive from my understanding and but depends on how big the tip is in my experience. I’ll say this, when playing music on 50% and people are talking to me I hear nothing until I pull one of them out. *comfort*
These are very comfortable and never feel like they are going to fall out. I’d say comfort is in direct proportion to taking a minute to switch out some tips or wings they provide to find what fits best for you. Anker-Soundcore is a vital company to the audio community. They are pushing the barrier with sound quality and giving to people at affordable prices. Giant companies will have to try harder to compete at this level thanks to them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-23,Best truly wireless earbuds for the money,"For the last year and a half or so I've had somewhat of an addiction to ordering truly wireless earbuds only to be disappointed in the sound quality, volume, fit, or combination of these. The Soundcore Liberty Pro 2 have changed that. The sound quality is by far the best of any truly wireless earbud I've used and surpasses some relatively expensive wired headphones I've used. The volume is more than sufficient and they fit quite well too. I'm not the biggest fan of the aesthetics but that is purely subjective and a compromise I'm willing to make. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone in search of a great, moderately priced set of truly wireless earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-24,Bass head crisp rumble,"The bass is insane, love love love great fit"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-24,Best Wireless buds,They sound great and for the price I think they're the best wireless ear phones made. They only negative is that it is difficult for someone to hear you on a phone call when you are in a very noisy environment
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-24,Sound quality,I could hear my footsteps thru my earbuds and body movements
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-24,Weak Bluetooth Connectivity,Product was working fine for the first few weeks. Now the Bluetooth constantly cuts in and out when the phone is right next to me. I've had better Bluetooth connection from 30 dollar wireless buds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-24,Good sound!,Good sound and great battery.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-24,Amazing,These are absolutely great I got them from the deal Jerry Rig Everything did for $40 off and I couldn't be happier with the sound quality these produce.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-24,Good set of buds!,Nice set of buds. They sound pretty great all around. I listen to mostly rock and classic rock. The bass boost eq setting seems to work for me pretty well overall. The one customized for me sounds hollow for some reason. I ran through it multiple times. Clarity is good and I don’t hear any hissing at all. They were easy enough to pair and I can wander my whole home and not lose Bluetooth. I don’t use them for calls so I can’t comment on that. Wish they had a little more volume. Also even though people say they have a ton of bass I feel like it’s a little on the high end if you are into that but plenty of other sets have more bass. These do also trend to be treble heavy in a lot of different music. They fit well and come with a ton of different sized adapters for your ears. The case seems to charge pretty quickly on wireless charging. Recommended if you want something that sounds good and has a ton of battery life. My set played for about 6.5 hours on a charge but I have been playing around with the different eq’s . Wish you could make a custom eq. Really needs it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-24,Read this!,WOW. With Viper4Android these things shine like a diamond! With a selected flat eq in soundcore app and tuned with v4a these things can sound like anything you want. Mine have NO HISS. I was a little worried but they got it right this time. Bass can be as loud as your head beside the subwoofer or gentle as a summers distant thunderstorm. I am truly blown away. I would not expect this much dynamics from even a mid priced pair of over ears. If ur waiting to pull the triggers on these DONT WAIT anymore. Price is great. You can listen to anything with these.. Good job Anker. I've totally replaced my sony 1000x buds. And noise isolation is great with a set of compy foam tips.. You should include them with these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-24,Worth every penny,"Extremely happy with these ear buds, great sound!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-25,"Lightweight, Great Sound Quality, & Long Lasting","A set of headphones to rival AirPods. These are very lightweight, very crisp with the audio and punchy with the bass. I can last a full day without having to recharge the case and the headphones themselves last around 6 hours. The audio profiles are very definitive, they definitely change the music you’re listening to and enhance it to the right sound. They haven’t fallen out for me yet but when you do decide to pull them out after 3 hours you might find that your ear may be full of sweat or earwax (sometimes both). Air channels would have been nice but sometimes comfort has to be sacrificed for the sake of quality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2019-12-25,Overpriced for what it is. Lacks features (no aptx HD) and uses low end chipset .,"These could be a 5-stat headphones if they were sold for around $50. $150 buys a much much better set of headphones from major brands. Unfortunately, Anker opted for the entry level chip, QCC3020 that only supports Apt-x but NOT Aptx HD. At this price level (hissing and other production quality audio issues notwithstanding), they had better used at least QCC3034 which does support Aptx HD. And ideally a higher end chip such as CSR8675 (with LDAC support)
Given the lack of other features on this supposedly premium flagship product by
Anker, for example Ambient sound, multi-point connectivity, all not to mention active noise cancellation (ANC), this should really be a $50 headset as it is on par with similar headsets using exact same chipset. I actually own several Anker products including soundcore Spirit X headphones (all rather good and much less expensive ), so I'm not dissing Anker per se, but they have clearly overshot by trying to market these in a premium price range while their features can't even remotely justify the price tag. It is Anker after all- $150 should get you a set with with more features than similarly priced Bose or Apple, the latter of which command immense brand and pricing power that Anker can't possibly match."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-25,Decent for the price,"I bought this because I have quite a few Anker products and have been very impressed with their brand. First thing out of the gate is get the app and let it do the pairing to your phone. Next, do the ear test that's within the app before setting your preferred EQ settings. Reason being, the sound quality depends on it. Don't be to concerned about the age requirement as it really means nothing or at least it meant nothing to me. I found the best curve for me at the 25-35 range. I am 55, and I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The sound quality is very good although if you dont setup that Ear cal and EQ settings you will be disappointed. The earpieces fit very well in my ears and the package came with a slew of earpieces and confirmations. It is nice that dont have to both earpieces in at the same time. You can choose to hear out of one or the other and still get good quality. Noise cancelling is about 85% with these earbuds so dont expect total quiet while listening. Phone calls, I think this is the only downfall of these earbuds. They tell you when you are talking to turn the microphone towards your mouth well I did and it still did not help. I would rate my phone experience at 80%. All the other functions that you can do with these earbuds worked perfectly. Changing volume. Fast forwarding, changing between calls etc.... Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-25,Best soundstage I've heard on a pair of wireless earbuds.,"Best soundstage I've heard on a pair of wireless earbuds. With the soundcore app, these sound even better. Listening to music with these are an experience. Great quality. Phone calls are clear. If there are any cons with these it would be no hear through feature. And maybe a little more customizable button features. Other than that I absolutely love these buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-25,Great quality and sound,This is better than my apple ear pods. Well worth the money. I highly recommend it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,0,2019-12-25,What could have been some great headphones,"I really really wanted to like these headphones. They checked off all the requirements I needed from a pair of true wireless headphones:
+usb c charging
+Physical buttons
+can use the buds independently
+summon assistant
+wireless charging is a plus
But the hiss. After receiving my original pair, I made the mistake of attempting to send the headphones to soundcore in order for them to fix the hissing issue. They sent me their second version of the headphones, which still have the hissing issue in what feels like an unchanged degree. As someone who listens to a lot of audiobooks and podcasts, the ever-present static hissing noise is quite bothersome, and even makes it difficult to listen to dialogue on low volumes. The headphones will hiss during muted audioplaying videos such as on Facebook or Twitter as well. According to support, I am no longer eligible for a refund, as the time it took to send me the improved pair voided my ability to do so. Now I am stuck with my hissing headphones with no way to refund. I was hilariously offered a discount on my next headphones purchase instead. I'm really dissapointed because this product could have been the perfect pair for me, especially at its price point. However, the audio quality and frustratingly difficult customer support experience will make it a long time before I consider another soundcore product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-25,Quality earbuds.,I researched ear buds on YouTube for over three weeks and this one was the best for the money. Bought 5. One for myself. My family loved them and so do I. The quality in sound is spot on. Talking is so crisp and clear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-25,Perfect earbuds,"Get these earbuds, Nothing else to say."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,Exactly what it needs to be,I'll keep this simple. I'm very picking about my audio quality. These sound very good (way better than the Galaxy Buds). These buds are also comfortable and work very well without being complicated with unnecessary features. Comes with options to fit any ear. I struggled with pairing them to my phone for the first time but eventually worked it out after downloading the app.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,Perfect Fit. Works great. Sounds Amazing,THese are actually comfortable and stay in my ears. THey also sound amazing. Highly recommend Anker products all around.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,Best under $200.00,The sound is just amazing.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-26,Constant Static,"These headphones are well-featured and it doesn't matter at all. The constant loud static ruins anything I listen to. So disappointed, the product design is actually quite good but all that good design is irrelevant in the shadow of awful sound quality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,Good stuff,Very comfortable. Fits better than AirPods
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,They're good,Great sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,Great battery life and sound,"First of all the battery life of this set it's amazing and I use them all day long, music, calls, audiobooks, etc.
Sound quality it's very good, very clear with a great amount of sound presets with their app.
The only complain I have is in this department and I understand that everybody is different but after a few hours with them my ear starts to hurt a little bit. But the overall value it's great I bought them with a $40 discount for a total of $110 and let me tell you I highly recommend them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,There what I have been waiting for.,"Awesome set of Phones. Great price, very good quality, easy to control, totally satisfied. Don't be fooled by the cost and if you never heard of Anker/Soundcore these things ROCK"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-26,Great sound but there not perfect,"I have had these for about a month now and I can say the sound great. With 23 total equilizer settings your bound to find one that takes you to your happy place. Only draw back is at high volumes you do get some crackles and pops when you use certain equilizer settings (I use bass reducer at max valume and they sound great). I love the fit and the lightness of them though and all around I would give it a 4 out of five stars. Battery life could be better, I use them for the gym and they usually will last me the 2 hours I'm in there one draw back though is that once the earbuds reach about 40% battery they start to lose connection and the music starts to skip. Bought another pair for my brother for Christmas and he loves them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,These earbuds will not disappoint.,"I liked everything about these earbuds. They surpass every earbuds I've ever owned as far as clarity, comfort, ease of connectivity and hours of operation."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-26,Great product,"Great product from Anker. Bought 4 pairs for gifts after loving my pair. Great sound and excellent battery life, couldn't be happier."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2019-12-27,Hope no more static,"The reason of 3 stars its had static on left earbud sometime it bothers me That’s why I returned it ,other then that was great battery life and the sound was amazing"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-27,Barbaros,Muy buenos y comodos
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2019-12-27,"Impeccable earbuds, some small issues.","So firstly, I’m an audio engineer, and sound quality was important to me and the primary feature that I wanted. These do sound great—for what they are. I come from the world of KEF, B&W, Klipsch, Polk, B&O, etc, and even though these sound excellent, they are a bit bright, around 4-7k is bumped up a touch too much imho. It’s not so much that they’re too detailed (the soundstage is great), it’s more that there is just aggressive energy in those frequencies. Changing the EQ to Flat reduces it a bit and is more accurate overall. The bass is definitely there, but I found almost all the EQ presets (including Ankers recommended EQ) to have too much. Again, Flat helps with this. My last earbuds were B&W cs5, and so these Libertys had a lot to live up to. The midrange is a tad recessed, but that’s okay for Bluetooth earbuds. I don’t really need critical accuracy. It just needs to be accurate enough. Again the sound quality is pretty outstanding for Bluetooth, but a customizable parametric EQ would be great, instead of just presets. I was disappointed when I realized I had no real control over the sound. I did the HearID, but I could always hear the tones in the test, so it didn’t make any custom changes...Maybe I’m missing something. The button assignment part of the app is useful. They feel comfortable, but I did change the tips and the little flared rubber piece that fits in the back of your ear. It’s simple to insert them and twist. I generally get a great fit each time quickly, although occasionally I need to wet the rubber tips first for some extra suction. The battery life, so far, seems excellent. I love the case, it looks like it’s for a horcrux or something. Their design is awesome. Look slick and conservative, but unassuming. Built very well, have good weight to them. The mics sound great, the people I’ve called heard me very well and clearly. But the environments were less crowded, so we’ll see. I was annoying that Anker didn’t include a transformer for the charging cable. Strange. There is a tiny, tiny amount of hiss from them, but I’ve heard just as much hiss from other headphones, and if you’re on an iPhone, the phone hisses somewhat when connected to audio output, so idk which device it actually is. All my other earbuds do it to varying degrees, and funnily the pricier headphones is where I hear it the most; but I haven’t experienced any of the crazy loud hissing or noise that others have complained about. Overall, impressive earbuds for being wireless and they have awesome sound with some tweaking, but they could use some custome EQ that I hope Soundcore will implement soon. Please!! Another great feature would be to be able to hear the outside world with the mics, but not a deal breaker for me. I still have my wired earphones for when I want truly exceptional sound without limits, but these seem perfect for my needs of just daily on the go. Some months later I changed to 5 stars. The more I use th the more I truly enjoy them. The custom EQ they implemented with updates is a fantastic feature! Astounding bass response that I didn’t notice initially. Battery life is exceptional. I’ve gone weeks with occasional use without charging. Seriously. Still sharp highs but more accustomed to it now. I’ve actually had trouble using Siri with the buttons but Siri is terrible in general imho. Highly recommend these earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-27,Great but just did not work for me but wish they did.,"These thing are very good. The sound is great, the base that comes out of these things is some of the best. It's good and clean and it goes great with overall sound. I only had one issue and it was the fit for me. They stay in your ear and everything but they were just to heavy for my ears, but if you have or ever owned the Bose sound sports free, and they worked for you, then you would love these and to me they sound better than the Bose sound sports free. So there you have it for the price and the sound that you get out of these they are in the ring with other up there and can hold their owne."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-27,Great sound.,"The sound quality is the sole reason why you get these over the other anker soundcore earbuds. Noise isolation is average, but these earbuds get loud enough to drown out environmental noises for me. They do bounce a bit when using for workouts that involve a lot of movement, but this may vary among people. You are able to use either earbud solo and the case has wireless charging and USB-c fast charging. You wont really need to charge the earbuds that often which is a huge plus."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-27,Awesome,Awesome
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2019-12-27,"They came used and full of ""ear dirt"".","Did not get a chance to test because they came used and full off ""ear dirt"". So nasty, it was supposed to be new. Disappointed in anker/Amazon customer service"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-27,Long story short...this Apple girl love these Anker earbuds!,This is the BEST sound for the money. I’m an Apple girl myself but I don’t always jump on the bandwagon because of a name. While other brands do have their pros and cons Anker Liberty 2 came with great reviews! I love them! I’m small to medium build and the size is great for me as well as my tall husband. It comes with so many different size tips you’re sure to find yours. The noise cancellation is amazing!! I can’t hear the kids or hubby even when the music is off! I don’t even have to pretend not to hear them. A mom needs this sometimes! The sound test to personalize your experience is neat too. The app allows you to customize the sound based on genere of music which is a win win too! Calls are crystal clear with both or just one earbud. After a full day of wearing them I have zero ear canal fatigue. My inner ears do not hurt like with other earbuds after just a short time. Also the case is easy to use and can plug in or wireless charge. Most others only have one manner of charging this has both! Go with quality and spend your hard earned money on the RIGHT wireless buds. Don’t buy the hype. Go with what works! This works and works well.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2019-12-27,"Decent for music, unusable for podcasts, audiobooks, etc.","While the sound quality is good enough for listening to music, there is a background hiss that makes them absolutely useless for listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and other media that is primarily spoken-word. I returned these and tried the non-Pro version, and both had the same hiss. The Pro version was tested on a Pixel 2 and the non-Pro version on a Pixel 4. So, given that the problem exists over both Liberty 2 models and multiple different devices, I can only conclude that this is a design or production fault. Both sets of earbuds were already updated to the latest firmware as well, so if this is fixable through firmware, no such fix currently exists."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-27,Excelente sonido,"Suenan tremendamente bien los uso con mi Fiio m6 y eso aumenta la experiencia, en mi opinión si los compran no se van a arrepentir."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,Connectivity Issues,"These things have the battery you would expect from an Anker product. The sound quality of these is great, and I definitely like their eq in the soundcore app. The issue is the connectivity issues when taking it out of the case and using one bud at a time, specifically the left one; this is also exasperated when using two buds and then switching to one bud."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,First ones ever and I’m satisfied,"Never cared for wireless earbuds. Finally decided to grab a pair. Im no expert on the plethora of options out there but for being my first pair, I really like them. I’ve been using the handheld, Soundcore soundbar for a while and thought to stick with a brand I liked; great decision, 😉."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,Astonishing sound. Genius Equalizer. Wow!,"I am new to high quality Bluetooth earbuds so I had no idea how good they’ve become. This will make me fall in love listening to music again. I put on that wonderful singer, Patricia Kaas and it was as if she was standing a few feet from me. A Mozart symphony? You are almost in the hall. Astonishing. I can make some comparisons. I originally bought Apple’s Air Pods Pro but returned them because their noise reduction did not work. Their sound was wonderful but these are in no way inferior, though much cheaper. The Liberty 2 Pros have one advantage, the genius equalizer. You just go to the Soundcore app and choose among a dozen styles to fit your music: jazz, pop, lounge, classical, piano etc. You can change the equalizer settings quickly and easily. The eartips are the best I’ve experienced and there are seven sizes. The tips have a loop at the end to make for even a better, secure fit. I had a problem connecting to my iPhone. No sweat. I phoned Soundcore, was quickly connected to a pleasant lady, who solved my problem in two minutes. Icing on the cake: for a brief time, Amazon had a nice discount on these buds that I took advantage of. But they are worth their weight in gold. So, you don’t think they are perfect I should add , they don’t have active noise reduction (very nice to have when in airplanes) and they are not really water resistant. So, if you sweat buckets in the gym, you probably should get a cheap pair for that. . Magnificent earbuds at half the price of the most expensive. P.S. I would have liked a tiny plastic loop on outside of buds to connect an anti-loss cord. If you lose one bud while on a bicycle you'll probably never find it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,Liberty 2 Pro are Awesome,"Bought a pair of Bose Soundsport Free , always have had Bose products. I started looking at different comparisons on the net and came across the the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 pro. Took a chance on them, because of other Anker products I own. All I can say is incredible the sound, Battery life, different in ear pieces."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,The Best!,Best earbuds! Love the sound and the price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,10/10 would smash,"Best set of wireless buds I've owned and listened to, just wish they had active pass through but its not that bug of a deal, bass is good but not over bearing, highs are crispy and mids are really smooth"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-28,Excellent bass and fit,"I just got delivery of these last week and have been using them every day for a few days. Very impressive-- especially with the bass/lower end of the music. I just returned a pair of Jabra Elite 65t's due to left side dying. These Liberty 2 Pro' are, in my opinion, better designed in terms of how they fit in my ear and the control buttons are much easier to push without discomfort on the earpiece. I really like the charging box, the sliding door can be used with one hand and the magnetic snap function eliminates having to fiddle with getting each unit to match the charging contacts. Also, the pro version lets me charge the box via wireless so no need to tether with a charging cable. So far I'm very impressed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-28,Better than I expected,I needed a pair of Bluetooth headphones for work. A YouTube tech reviewer named Flossy Carter did a video about these and said he purchased his set from Amazon. He highly recommended these so I ordered them and I LOVE them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-29,Awesome sounding earbuds and the price is right!,"These are by far the best earbuds I have ever owned. I'm coming from the Sony WF-SP700N and although these do not have any type of ANC, the moment you find the right fit with the huge amount of ear tips provided, you will notice that ANC is not needed because of the seal provided by the correct fit. Call quality is also a major improvement over the SONYs and so is the companion app with EAR ID which customizes your EQ sound profile. Battery life is great and I have not needed to recharge these during the day and I use them a lot. USB-C would make recharging a breeze and the convenience of QI wireless charging is a much appreciated bonus. Get those, you will not regret it!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-29,Longest battery life!,Great product!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-29,Best TWS at this price point.,"I absolutely love the buying experience!! The customer services from Soundcore is top notch. I have not seen any customer service as good as theirs so far! On the product, I love the sound quality and the number of presets EQ in the Soundcore app. There is definitely going to be at least 1 EQ that satisfy your needs. For me, it would be the Small Speaker EQ.
Go ahead and try out this product. It will not disappoint you and in my opinion it wins have down to most TWS at this price point. The only down side for me would be it's aesthetic. Physical size is quite big for some. But it is still quite comfortable to wear."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-29,Best wireless earbuds I've ever owned.,"Best bluetooth earbuds I've ever owned. They are super comfortable, and the microphone is great. They reconnect with my galaxy s9 really fast. I get a little white noise when I don't have media playing, but am still browsing. The sound quality is amazing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-29,Sound is the best than all the other $200.00 true wireless.,"Teriffic set of wireless. For the techies out there, the driver size is 11.0 mm. The Klipsch is 6.0 and the Melomania is 5.0. All priced the same. Bigger is always better. The Soundcore-Anker is the best of the three."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-30,"Very worth it at $150, a no-brainer at $109",Just buy them if you can get them. Sound quality is voodoo! No way these should sound this strong. Destroys my Galaxy Buds and hands down beat out the Jabra Elite 75t. I mainly use them for music but I now also use them for ASMR videos from YouTube when I'm trying to sleep. They stay in place while sleeping which is a huge bonus. The app is just gravy on top of an already extremely appealing package. Just buy these while you can.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2019-12-30,The best earbud and way better than AirPods 2nd generation!,I love the clarity and spaital palette of sounds. Great bass and my favorite is the faint details of the instruments and vocals! Better and a different level of earbuds than the Apple AirPods 2 nd generation and the same price. The best earbuds I’ve ever used so far.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-31,"A very good pair of truly wireless earbuds, at a great price point.","These Liberty 2 Pros are being primarily used with an Apple iPhone XSMax. First, let me say that I have listened to quite a few types of wireless earbuds, including Apple, Sony, Klipsch, Beats and others. I am not going to say that these are hands down the best I've heard, but I will say that these are my new favorite pair. They have outstanding clarity, deep, but controlled bass, and do have a sound stage that is really outstanding. Allow me to add that I have not experienced any of the hissing or background noise that others have had with these buds. They are dead silent when they are supposed to be. I would assume that has to do with an update to their Soundcore App? I really don't know. In any case, this was a major concern when I ordered these and read the reviews here. If that were the case, I would've simply returned them. Happily, that will not have to occur. The fit and comfort of these are perfect for my ears. That was always the major deal breaker with Apple's buds. They simply did not fit well in my ear canals, which are small. I've defaulted back to the stock tips and wings. They were the most comfortable and most secure fitting of the myriad of choices that Anker supplies with these earbuds. If sound isolation is important to you, these do a great job of blocking outside noises, even though they have no active noise cancellation. This is also where the best fitting tips will be imperative. Important to note, Anker’s recommendation of ""insert, twist and lock"" really is the best way to position them in your ears. So, to summarize, for listening to music, these are a 9 out of 10. Watching YouTube videos provided no noticeable latency issues. Same with Netflix and Amazon. Great earbuds to watch movies with. There were times when I noticed a very small delay/latency, but it corrected itself right away. I don't think that has to do with the Liberty 2 Pros, as much as the general stream overall. So, for entertainment, watching videos etc., I'll give them an 8 out of 10. The Soundcore app does what it’s supposed to do, and the fact that there is a dedicated app to fine tune the buds is a bonus. I only wish Anker would provide a graphic equalizer option to truly customize the sound. Maybe in a future software update? Anker, are you listening? The charging case is either a love it or like it thing. I love it. The way the top slides open is classy. It's cool. And it’s different than flipping a top like on other cases. The case has a smooth feel to it and fits comfortably in a pocket. The battery life is simply outstanding, and probably the best out there right now. USB-C is a great choice for fast wired charging, but the fact that they support wireless charging was the icing on the cake. One of my favorite non-listening aspects of the Liberty 2 Pros. Now, for where I feel the Liberty 2 Pros could improve... call quality. Even with the 4 microphones, callers I asked would say there was a difference in speaking through the buds and using the actual phone. The buds made the calls ""distant"" sounding. I heard it for myself. It's by no means a deal-breaker, but something that could be improved upon. Ambient noise cancelling was pretty good, as callers didn't notice excessive bleed-through of other voices or street noise. Overall, I would give them a 5 out of 10 for call quality, and a 6/10 for noise rejection. Overall recommendations: I would certainty stack the Anker Liberty 2 Pros against other mid-premium earbuds in the $150-$200 price bracket. I paid $117 (with tax), and for that price, they simply cannot be beat. Period. Since the price has dropped over the past couple of months, I might guess that Anker is planning an updated offering in the $150-$200 range. If that were to happen, I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade, if they really were able to improve on these already outstanding earbuds. If sound quality is important to you, as it is to me, these are a fantastic bargain for under $200. If call quality is most important to you, then you may want to look elsewhere. Again, not a deal breaker for me, but it could be for you. I would buy these again, in a second. I really like the Liberty 2 Pros by Anker. They do what they are designed to do very well, and that's what matters."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2019-12-31,Good over all sound quality with just one drawback,Need to be able to adjust volume level louder than it will allow. Max volume is too low
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-01,"BEST SOUNDING EARBUDS, AIRPOD PRO KILLER","Guys, trust me on this. I own a $400 pair of shure se 535s, Meizu live headphones, brainwavz b400, and these are better than all three. The bass on these is sooo deep and precise, without being too much. And the upper mids and trebles sparkle like you'd never believe. The Knowles balanced armature driver shines like never before with this dynamic + BA combo. And if you ever have any problems, Ankers warranty and customer service is unbeatable, so you can rest assured knowing your purchase will hold its own for many years to come."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-01,Totally Impressive!,This beats out my more expensive Bose and Sennheiser TWS. The sound is really clear. I like the numerous equalizer settings. My search for headphones has concluded.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-01,The best earbuds out there!,"I ended up getting a bad set, but reached out to anker/soundcore. Their costumer service was great! Did a couple trouble shooting test, and they ended up sending me a new pair. These earbuds are hands down the best out there. The hype is real with these buds! But that is also my opinion, but I'm very picky about how my music sounds. I know everyone has different opinions with sound. Bottomline I couldn't be happier with the earbuds, and the costumer support from soundcore. Great job anker/soundcore!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-01,Price,"Great quality for less
Battery life"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-01,What a great job Anker did!,"Disclaimer: Anker sent me this pair of Liberty 2 Pro free of charge to replace the Liberty Air 2 which I was not very happy with (still good for its price). However, I am making a fair assessment of the product just like I would've if I had purchased the product myself with MSRP. Design and quality are both great for anything under $200. Not gonna talk too much about it since Anker is always known for its quality and reliability. Pairing was easy, too. The App is okay. Want to focus on the sound. I'm neither a professional nor an audiophile. However, I can be quite analytical as I've been spending quite some money (more than my wife would like) on consumer audio products including speakers and components from B&W, Monitor Audios, NAD, etc., as well as headphones & amps in the $150 - $300 range from brands like Sennheiser, Creative, Sony, Denon. I have a 2-hour-each-way daily commute in suit & tie into NYC and have been tried different solutions from the Apple Airpods to Sony WI1000X to Sennheiser IE80 paired with Astell & Kern Xb10... I bought the Liberty Air 2 for a little more convenience but was not completely satisfied with its sound quality - I'm so happy that the Liberty 2 Pro worked out well so I dont need to deal with wires on my shirt anymore. The concept was excellent - a hybrid design with an armature driver paired with a dynamic driver to deliver both the clarity and the punch, with sharp highs and warm, fat lows. My Sony WI1000X uses the same concept (although the drivers are not coaxial and it has a ANC module that makes it too bulky on the neck), with very different tuning presumably. The Sony performs great and very, very well balanced. The Anker, sounds unique with limited transition between high and low, which can be easily solved by switching EQ profiles in the app (I like the Piano setting). No it will not out perform the IE80 driven by an external DAC or even an Ipad, but it's so good that I'm willing to use it on a daily basis and use it as my only truly wireless earbuds - I would've paid full price for it if I had the chance to test it. This is the one if you want to spend more than $100 on wireless, there is no competitor when it comes to comprehensive performance per dollar. One thing to mention is that some people mentioned background noise - it's quite common with low impedance, armature drive headphones and I actually like it because of the amazing clarity feeling comes with it (just like adding grains to a photo will make it look sharper). It's a compromise, a good compromise for anything at this price point. If active noise cancelling is important to you (make sure you know what it does - primarily cancelling lower frequency noises such as jet engine noise in flight), you'll need to go with Apple or go with regular wireless from Sony or Bose. As a conclusion, as a very new company and a new player in the area, Anker did an amazing job developing and making this product. Their customer service is top notch and price is very reasonable. I will highly recommend this product or anything else from Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-01,Awesome earbuds for the price,"These earbuds are absolutely amazing sound and the benefit of using them independently is great. The only thing lacking is noise cancelation, it does a pretty good job but if you're driving and have window cracked or heavy winds not so great, but you still can be heard. But the sound, quality, and functionality can't be beat."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-01,I luv them,I replaced my bose with these i prefer these. I also have apple earpods i prefer ankar
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-01,Good sound and Quality,The build on these are quite good and it results in great sound. However they are heavier than other earbuds due to the quality of the components. Due to this they really are not good while working out which is why I purchased them. They just dont stay seated in you ears when you are moving and sweating. If you want these for non-workout applications they should be fine.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Great equipment !,They are very compact.. !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Sound quality,"The price is not bad for the quality of ear buds you are getting , the fit is good , sound isolation is great , and the quality of sound is Amazing , I feel like I got my money's worth"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,"No passthrough, but still great!",The battery on these is amazing! I usually only use the right earphone during work and it will last a 12 hour shift on low volume. They are sleek and comfortable without looking like a d bag with airpods. The only drawback I've noticed is the lack of a passthrough mode. I've messaged the company and this function is supposedly coming in a future firmware update (fingers crossed)
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Good,Good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Best pods,Just a very outstanding product at a very resonable price!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Sound quality is Awesome!!,PHENOMENAL! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Great ear buds. Anker knocked it outta the park with these.,"Amazing sound. Once you tune 'em to your ears with the Soundcore app, they're just great. They have great battery life and maintain a very strong connection. The area surrounding my home isn't kind at all to Bluetooth signals (there is a literal ton of interference from a nearby power station), and these go unaffected. The AptX codec is also a nice touch."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Very Good,Very good sound quality. Let's you hear a lot of details.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-02,Great wireless headphone,These are definitely with better sound quality than my old ones without phase in and out. The battery life seems to be very good and last for a long while. They also fit in my ear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Amazing sound quality,"Audio is spectacular. I'm shocked how good it is, even at this price point. The battery life is stunningly good too. I've had a slight problem with a high pitched hiss that is apparent once an audio source connects. Not terrible, but noticeable. Call quality is better than expected. Not perfect, but much, much better than the liberty neo. Fit and comfort is a little wonky, but my ears are hard to fit for and yours may be much better. Overall I am quite pleased."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,Bueno,Muy bueno
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-02,"Excellent sound, features and comfort for the money...",My first set of wireless earbuds. Did a lot of reading and comparing from different manufacturers. Excellent sound and features for the money. I have small ears so I liked the many different sizing options included. Very comfortable. I also like the case.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Amazing sound!,These earbuds are great! The sound they have is very nice and clear while having a really good bass. Be sure to make it fit properly with all the tips and wings it comes with. The only con I wpuld put is the IPX rating wich is IPX4 but other than that great product
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Battery issues,"Update Review:
After I received the replacement from Anker, I've tried it for a couple of days and it works a better than the last. The battery of the new unit's is much more durable than my old one, which would drain quite fast."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Small but mighty!,"These buds rock! I Use these mostly for causal listening but they definitely feel secure enough for use during a workout, sound quality is great but I have noticed a bit of ambient sound bleeding through. All in all though I’m very pleased with these earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-03,Good if they fit you,These earbuds sounded great but none of the wingtips fit my ears. I'll sadly have to return these
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-03,Best earbuds under $300,I researched and listened to several earbuds before settling on these and they sound amazing! Tremendous separation and a wide sound stage. Solid bass without overshadowing the mids and highs.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Outstanding Product - Superior Sound,In a word: WOW! These are incredible. Best sound I’ve ever heard from a set of wireless earbuds. Saw a bunch of reviews about some kind of background hiss. Right out of the box I did the firmware update thru the Soundcore App. No hiss. No problems. Outstanding sound quality. Great fit in my ears. Very pleased with this purchase. Glad I got the pro version instead of the next ones down. Well worth the money.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Best product for the money,Love the headphones excellent quality the sound is superb
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-01-03,"Great for music, terrible at phone calls",Great sound but terrible drops during phone calls. Wish it could pair with two devices at the same time.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-03,Buena,No da ni dos horas de batería
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-03,"Good quality I’m sure, but not the look I teen wanted",Bought them for my teenage daughter but she didn’t like them. The buds are large and black and not attractive looking for a young girl. They did have several sizes of the rubber insert which was good.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Sound quality is great thanks to HearID,"I love the personalized equalization for each ear and full spectrum sound you get from these. They are noise isolation earphones and they have a very wide assortment of tips and wings to ensure a great fit. The case is small and with eight hours of play time on the earphones and 32 hours overall with the small charging case, these are worth it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,The best audio quality,"This is the best sound I have heard in any headphone sub 200$ price range. Everything is perfect, 100% recommended. Only complain is single button with limited configurations. I hope future firmware updates will make it possible to configure more actions."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,great producgt,Bought for my son at Christmas. He loves them. He kept going on and on about how great they were and cancelled out the noise.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,One of the best budget earbuds.,"I personally love it but had to return it for no reason, just need the cash for something else."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Sound is great,Very good sound quality and fit.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-03,Fantastic!!!,Great for listening to music!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-03,just shy of perfect,"love the quality on these in every way, from the noise cancellation to the audio sound. extremely good on battery life, i use them to listen to music alot. the only gripe is the design of the headphones can easily make them uncomfortable over prolonged use and the lack of ambient sound (and yes, i have already swapped in the smaller sizes for the ear ring, and ear bud). beyond that, i would buy again"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,"Great fit, superior sound","I am very picky in regards to the fit of my earbuds. When in use for any extended period of time, most tend to hurt my ears or become loose, however, these stay snug and secure. The sound quality is superior to most and pairing is very fast and stable. Only gripe is the lack of mic pass through so when someone is taking to me or vice versa it is muffled."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,"Sensational sound with expansive sound stage, exceptional comfort, and fantastic battery life","I got some Samsung Galaxy Buds last summer but was underwhelmed by the call quality and sound quality when listening to music. So, before deciding to buy a new pair I did a lot of research online and saw that Liberty 2 Pro was getting good reviews on tech websites and from YouTubers. I decided to take the plunge and I bought myself a pair to see if they live up to the hype. I’ve been using them for just over a week now and I’m very happy that I chose Liberty 2 Pro over more expensive options, such as the Sony WF1000XM3. Pros:
- The packaging is beautiful! Soundcore obviously put a lot of effort into the design and the result feels very premium. If I received this as a gift, I’d be very happy! - They stay in your ears and don’t fall out. The box comes with a huge range of ear tips and wings, but I found the ones that were already on the earbuds fit my ears perfectly. They also stayed firmly in position while I did yoga. - The sound quality is amazing! It’s rich and balanced, and the bass is strong but not overpowering when I listen to bass-heavy genres like EDM and Hip-Hop. I was surprised just how expansive the soundstage actually is and I found myself hearing details in songs that I’d never heard before. Also, there wasn’t any distortion when I listened at high volumes. To cut a long story short, I personally think the sound is much better than the Galaxy Buds and after testing a friend’s Sony WF1000XM3 true wireless earbuds I have to say, Liberty 2 Pro knocks them out both out of the park when it comes to sound quality and comfort. - You can customize the EQ via the APP. I really like how the Soundcore App has a huge selection of EQs to choose from, as well as “HearID” which was easy to use and gave me a custom EQ profile. - Battery life is fantastic! One charge easily provides me with music for my commute to and from work, plus listening at the office. Having 3 extra charges with the charging case is also super convenient for forgetful people like myself! Cons:
- I’m being a little picky, but I wish there were more color options. It would be nice if there was a white version available, but it’s not a deal-breaker. - Noise isolation is decent, but it’s obviously not as effective as earbuds with noise cancellation when you’re listening in super loud environments. However, the ear tips create a really good seal that blocks out a lot of noise. Overall, I’m really happy with my Liberty 2 Pro earbuds and they definitely exceeded my expectations for what a $149 pair of true wireless earbuds could sound like. I think they’re better than Galaxy Buds and Sony true-wireless earbuds and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for the best-sounding true wireless earbuds out there."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Excellent sound quality. Much better than AirPods.,Excellent sound and terrific support. I had a minor issue with my order and sent an email. I got a quick and very fair response. The person who handles support is excellent.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Excellent quality.,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Waste your money. Worth it,Best earbuds on the market.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Great Sound Quality,"I have tried other brands of earbuds, none compare to the quality of the sound of the Liberty 2 Pro from Anker
Worth the price"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-04,"Great earbuds, Great price","Since these are my first pair of wireless earbuds, I don't have anything to compare them to. I am really impressed with what I got though. The sound quality is fantastic, even though I have experienced the background hiss that other people have discussed, you only hear it when nothing is playing. When you're playing music it makes no difference, which is all I care about. The battery life is more than I need, the selection of ear pieces helps customize the fit nicely for most ears, and I'm impressed with the sound quality of phone calls on both ends. The Soundcore app is nice and it's selection of EQ presets work very nicely. My one negative would be the control button on the buds themselves, it's not convenient or consistent. All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase and will not be looking to replace these anytime soon."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Very good,Work
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Good entry level truly wireless earbuds,I am really enjoying listening music with this ear buds. Sound quality is really good. The battery life is ok.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-04,Amazing sound,I loved then and was really surprised when I put them on
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-04,Sound quality is great,Easy to install. Great sound. Ear fit for me right out of the box. Exceeded my expectations.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,Happy with product and seller,Husband is happy with his Christmas gift - arrived quickly and packaged well.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,They sound fantastic!,An amazing piece of tech. Sounds amazing and works seamless with video content.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,Worth every penny.,"Second best set of headphones I own and the best in ear set I own. The only thing that out performed these is the sony WH-1000XM3 and they are an over ear set, they are also twice the price. I have studio rated headsets and these are just as good but wireless"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-05,Great overall.,Love it overall. The way it fits in the case is awkward.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,Incredible sound. Must buy!,"Before purchasing these I saw all the reviews on YouTube, handwritten... They don't look like the sleek Samsung buds in your ear, but they sound like Sony noise canceling over-the-ear headphones thumping Bass awesome highs mids... These are my go to buds they don't fall out of my ear they sound amazing..."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-05,I’m no audiophile but these buds are pretty great,Received these at Christmas. With all of the choices for wireless buds out there and all of the opinions offered it’s not easy to take a leap of faith and go for a set from a brand that historically is not known for high quality audio. But after all the reading and research I really liked what I saw in the features these buds offered and am happy to say they deliver. Once you upgrade the firmware and dial in the fit and sound you will be happy you took that leap.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,Excellent. Lives up to the hype.,"They are all around excellent earphones that excell in almost every way. Crisp audio quality, Long battery, discreet, passive noise cancelling all on point. Only downside is my ears get sore sometimes. But overall 9.8/10"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,"Wow, while not cheap, Anker has something figured out here!!!","First off let me start off by stating I have tested a LOT of headphones over the years. I'm extremely technical in my IT field and that obsession with tech translates into every other aspect of my life. I'm extremely picky and while I'm not rich, I'm comfortable enough to get the best of things I really love. Don't let this fool you though, I'm also super cheap where I can be. As a matter of fact, this review is predicated on me moving on from something ""cheap"" to obviously NOT even close to cheap. When it comes to home audio I've been a Sennheiser fan for many years. I've had some higher-end Sony's over the years and even once had a pair of studio Denons. When it comes to earbuds though, frankly put I never have been overly impressed. I found a solution for around 40 dollars that would last around a year + and while they weren't anywhere NEAR a full ear covering headphones quality they also didn't make my ears cringe. I have gone through a lot of different headphones from true wireless like these (soo many) and a few of the same non true wireless/ wireless Bluetooth style ones like from Bose. I returned ALL but these and the Bose. For a company that first hooked me with their awesome battery banks, this is quite the leap and I admit I was very hesitant at first but now I am very glad I got them! I was planning only keeping one and when the Bose impressed me, it admittedly raised the bar for others. Even without that though every other true wireless had some caveat I didn't like. Either the sound was terrible, the case was horrible, charging was too frequent or inconvenient. etc. The biggest difference between these, Bose and the cheaper options was how the headphone had to fit “PERFECT” to sound good. These just fit great, stay put and sound impressive without having to overly manipulate to get them just right. I even had a few had touch controls and constantly needed to be adjusted. ANNOYING!! I’ll take the physical button over touch in this case. The sound on these immediately impressed me and got my attention compared to the other true wireless style ones I have. Then I did the personalized EQ via the Soundcore app. Game changing. I believe I have pretty high hearing ranges and these headphones feel like they tailor right to them. Highs are CRISP with no tinny sound and you really hear the range of instruments. Pop on some Rap/Hip Hop and you’ll immediately notice these are no slouches when it comes to bass. Honestly anymore bass and it would make my ear itch. Full disclosure, I have a 500+ watt surround sound system on my computer and grew up with subs in my cars. These sound AMAZING! I'm telling you these sound so good, you'll notice your bad quality MP3's 100 times worse and even will notice sounds that made it past studio mastering. (amp feedback etc) Just at a bit higher volume than the bose does. No joke these are that good. The case is wireless charging so you don't have to fuss with ANOTHER cable if you so choose. To be honest, I've had them for a few days now and haven't even needed to come near charging and I've been playing with them FAR more than I'll ever use headphones on a regular basis. Its almost 10 pm now, I've been rocking music non stop on them all day. I took some calls on it and even left music playing while buds were out and I was eating. (eating and earbuds is just weird imo) Anyways. Since I've got them, trying to use the crap out of them the lowest I've seen the ear buds get down to is 80%, immediately afterwards putting them in the wireless charger, which still shows 3/3 bars. WOW. Considering the intended use for these and likelihood they won't be my gym headphones and the Bose Soundsports will fit that role, I'll probably have to set the wireless charger on the Qi Charger once or twice a month at this rate. One unintended surprise is I will use them more than I EVER thought for I found in about 75% of the ones I touched, you can't just go single ear easily without having to do steps to ensure it pairs right the next time to both or bla bla bla. I'm a network engineer by trade and still don't want to go through unnecessary hoops for basic functions. These just work, you pull out the right ear piece, put it on, and you can make calls on it. I didn't have to do anything special to have them be headphones again as normal next time. Smart. While on that track, the noise cancellation is top-notch. People can hear me very clearly no matter where I am, I allowed my 14 year old to try them and proceeded to talk all kind of smack to him to see if he could hear me. Until I was fairly loud and right next to him, he was none the wiser. :)
Gaming performance on these is like most aptx devices, OK but not great. Definitely better than earlier codec versions of Bluetooth . Built in youtube app is FAR better than watching video in the browser etc (likely to hardware acceleration) I’m going to do some testing in dev options and see what I can do. Only cons I could think of it not being cheaper but that immediately disappeared when I heard them. They are clearly a premium product. Active noise cancellation would be a good feature but personally I don’t travel or need to listen to them in noisy environments etc.
TLDR
Awesome bass, clear highs with overall great sound. Alexa / Google assistant works fantastic!! Only con would be if you don’t have 150 dollars to buy them yourself or ABSOLUTELY need active noise cancellation which I would imagine you probably wouldn’t be buying earbuds? Buy them now. Come back and thank me later 😊 Anker, great job! I see why you guys are rocking it!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,Super comfy,So just got these and I must say these are the best headphones ever. They sound amazing and they are super comfy. Definitely recommend these to anyone who has trouble finding ear buds that don't fit right.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-01-05,ok earbuds.,"Sounds quality is ok. Has a lot of bass. Battery last forever, very impressed. Fit perfectly in your ears, no pressure at all. When comparing to Airpod 2, the airpod 2 is clearer. Couldn't set the volume control on the earbuds using the app. Also when on a phone call, people voice run from one earbud to the other like surround sound, very strange."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-05,"Customizable EQ, Great Overall Sound","I’ve bought quite a few truly wireless headphones searching for the “perfect sound”. Some sound great, terrible battery life. More sound terrible, better battery life. These headphones do sound really good. I honestly can’t say if they are the best, but I think I’m satisfied with my search. I like that there are multiple EQ options and the AI sound test to tailor to your hearing. Some people like more/less bass and you have the options to adjust to that. I also like it pretty loud and these can handle that without getting distorted."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-01-05,Static and high pitch constant hiss,"Thought I would try them due to stellar reviews here on Amazon and other places. Unfortunately I do have to side with some of the other negative reviews. Sound is far from Studio Quality. There is a constant high hiss that is very annoying. Bass/Loudness for my taste is far too aggressive. Setting EQ to flat, takes out mids as well. Not for me. Returning."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,Legit.,"These things are legit! EQ app adds a lot, so def download that. I found “Piano” preset to be perfect for me across many genres. Got these on sale before Xmas for $99, what a steal! I need noise isolation and these do it well. Awesome sound. Super happy!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,A fantastic pair of earbuds!!,"These earbuds are so easy to enjoy. Soundstage, check. Articulate, check. Comfort, check. These are so engaging, especially when setting the EQ to your liking with the Soundcore app. I have lots of Bluetooth buds, Sennheiser, Jaybirds, JLab, Beats and they all have their strengths but the Liberty 2 Pros have the ability to put a smile on my face no matter what type of music I'm listening to. At $149, you won't be disappointed, and if you can catch the $40 off coupon, then hit the buy it now button as fast as you can."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,"Great sounding, reasonable price.","I've held off on buying quality ear buds due to cost and questionable reviews. When I looked several reviews for these I was intrigued, so I bought them. I am glad I did! As expected, they are light years ahead of the cheap Chinese pair I had, but I wasn't prepared for how good these would sound. Also, for the price I believe Anker has a real hit on their hands. I'm very pleased."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds Sound Great,"Great sound, and the fit is very comfortable. I am able to wear them for long time periods without pain. Battery life good as advertised."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,Sound quality is outstanding,I used wireless headphones all the time and these earbuds are as good or better than most I have owned. Really remarkable sound quality from these buds. The noise cancelling is good but not great but better than you might expect from earbuds. Overall these are are terrific buds and a good value.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-06,What kind of awful headphones are you selling here?,"The sound quality is fine, but these headphones have TERRIBLE connectivity. I ordered a pair and within a week the left earbud stopped connecting. I browsed forum and after forum, read thread after thread, packed with other customers who had similar experiences and had emailed support only to get answers that didn't work! I have tried everything under the sun to get the left earbud to sync properly without luck. Absolutely terrible product. Spend your money on something else because God knows this company isn't going to give it back after you buy their low quality earbuds. I'm beyond frustrated."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,"Almost perfect, and priced very well.","These work great. The fit is perfect due to the large assortment of different size eartip. The sound is amazing, it will make u want to throw away your old headphones right away. My only complaint is there is no ambient sound mode. The battery life is ridiculous too. They last forever."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-06,"It could have been so good... You didn't do me right, Anker.","I am a huge fan of Anker. I love their products and love their customer service even more. I've purchased batteries, chargers, docks, you name it. Most of the time, they are awesome right out of the box. Even when it does not measure up to Anker quality, it is quickly fixed or rectified by super fast and helpful Anker customer support. So I bought the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro for Christmas. It was amazing! Clear crisp treble, loud bass, wireless charging, ergonomic fit, and especially, the Soundcore app! Unfortunately, then I began to notice the hiss. I tried to ignore it but it was very noticeable. I searched the internet and found others experiencing similar situations. So I contacted Anker's customer support, quite confident that they would help me sort this out. Even though the first response said they would get back to me after Christmas break (which I totally understand), they actually reached out to me during the actual holiday! (How awesome is that?!!) I was so certain that this would be a happy ending. Unfortunately, it is not. Anker asked me to send them a pic of the serial number before they can send me a new pair. When they got the serial number, they said that is the latest pair and there is nothing else they can do for me. I asked to try a different pair to no avail. It was really strange because they flat out refused to let me try a different pair. I felt as though they just changed their tune and slammed the door on my face. It could have been so good, Anker. I was your biggest fanboy. You simply refused to do what is right. I am very sad to say that I am crossing Anker off my list of companies that I truly trust and adore. Adios."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,These bad boys ROCK!,These bad boys ROCK!!! Wow it's like I hear the music at a completely new level. Amazing headphones!.🤘🤘
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,item works great,"This is a great item, clear mids, highs and light to deep bass with the ap. Great product and great price during Black Friday deals."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-06,All around great!,"I love these! I commute on a city bus for work every day and these are a life saver! They have a long battery life, don’t move once I put them in my ears and block jut enough sound that I can ignore most of it but not so much that I’m oblivious to things around me. The sound of these is great! I usually listen to audio books but have also listened to a variety of music with them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-06,"Bulky, with great sound","These are easily the best sounding wireless buds. I just could not get them to fit right, I dont have the deep pocket in my ear to catch the wing. And finally they are just too big, not a sexy design they stick out alot."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-01-06,"Nice sound quality, but hiss noise is there..","When you play the music, there will be an static noise can be heard if the background voice is small. Although I think the build has good sound quality and powerful bass. It's pity that still has room to improve."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,So glad I got these instead of the AirPods!!,Lovin’ the bass on this thing!! Don’t know the call quality yet but for me it was more about the music and it delivered! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Very nice product,Works great
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Mini blasters,"Battery life is a little short, and sound quality during phone calls can be sketchy. During movies and music the sound quality is great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Fantastic Bluetooth earbuds!,"These are fantastic! The sound is nice and full. The bass is really good (like really good) but doesn't overpower anything. The mids and highs are clear and crisp. The noise isolation is solid. Making phone calls with these is fine, but I haven't done that much yet. Tl;Dr great earbuds, definitely go for it if they're on sale."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Just buy them!,My first set of ear buds and i am not disappointed. Also got a friend who has 2 or 3 different brands of ear buds to buy these and he still thanks me for selling him on these buds!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,You where your word with the product and the service!,"I use them when I commute to work and to work out! They are light and stay put 👍🏽
I also was pleased with how hast I received them just in time for Christmas!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Liberty pro 2,These have great sound. Easy to use app. With great sound control
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Best sounding ear buds I've used.,"I use these mostly for music around the house. Sometimes podcasts.. They sound amazing. Bass is strong but well controlled. Highs are a little sharp, but not bad. Soundcore app is helpful for dialing in the EQ."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-07,"Superior design, sound, product; unparalleled listening experience - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","Overall superior design, sound, & product; unparalleled listening experience - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Strengths:
-App designed to provide signature listening profile for the customer's unique & particular listening needs along with a butt ton of audio profiles
-Solid passive noise isolation provided out of the box; earbuds provide a comfy, snug fit
- Crisp, robust, and resonating sound; the buds massage your music to deliver a pronounced & wonderful auditory experience
- Qi & usb-c charging capable
- Excellent product at the price point (approx $150-ish)
Improvement areas:
- Does not offer active ANC for music/listening (phone calls are the exception) or transparency/hear-through mode
- No touch controls, uses physical buttons (personal preference subjective)
- Music can sometimes feel over enhanced/modulated/emphasized (is this too nitpicky?) * Listening to music with these buds is like having a fine meal expertly prepared, cooked, and delivered specifically for you. (admittedly, sometimes you want feel-good food instead of the chef's delicacies, i.e. an almond joy instead of an amuse buche)
** FYI, I have not yet experienced the hissing/static anomaly in this pair of buds that several other customers have mentioned previously
*** All manufacturers should provide apps for their devices with this level of variety and detail to enhance the customer's listening experience"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-07,Good alternative to pricey pioneers,Good alternative to Airpods pro. There is a blue light which keeps blinking on earbuds which is annoying. Many times remote end can't hear what I am saying. These are little issues which decreases the user experience but worth the price point.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Worth it!,Best ear phones I’ve ever owned.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,Amazing sound Quality,"I use these products everyday, The sound quality of these are amazing and unrivaled I would easily buy another pair. The only issue is pain in your ear canal after extended time wearing, but besides that these are amazing"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-07,BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!!!! Or BUCK$$,"The best earbuds I’ve ever owned. Not disappointed. Awesome bass boost and awesome app with equalizer, perfect fit in my ears and will not fall out no matter how hard I try."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,Great sounding earbuds,"Best sound of any TWS headphones I’ve tried. Lacking some features like pass through and active noise cancelling, but totally worth the price for the sound alone."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,Great quality!!!,Love that you dont have to charge every night. Sound quality is amazing as well as call quality. Just a couple of things i did not like are: 1) each earbud connects separately and 2)they are a bit on the bulky side
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,So much bang for your buck!,"These earbuds are easily the best I have ever owned. The only thing keeping them from 6 out of 5 stars is the lack of anc. That aside, these are amazing. If you are on the market and dont feel like paying a name, get these and enjoy true quality sound. If you love music, you owe it to yourself to treat yourself to these!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,Great sound and easy to pair with my phone.,"This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds, but they work fantastically and I don't have any real complaints. If you aren't playing anything or in between tracks there is a slight hiss sometimes, but I guess that isn't something that bothers me since I don't hear it when I am playing something. I would recommend these to just about anyone but the most discriminating audiophile, especially considering the price vs many of the competitors."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-08,Hands down the best sound I've heard in true wireless earphones,"For 2 years I used my trusty Anker Zolo Liberty+ earphones. The sound was good, they were comfortable, and the passive noise isolation was really good. My only gripes were the fit wings that shifted around covering the charging contacts, mono sound on phone calls, and push button calls that had me pushing the earphones farther into my ear when summoning Siri. They still work well, but the battery life isn’t was it was. Time to move on and maybe resolve some of my complaints. I first tried AirPods. Super convenient, all day comfort with barely passable sound, but they fail miserably in noisy surroundings. I next ordered the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pros but delays in shipping caused me to cancel my order. I was super happy with the announcement of AirPods Pro. Bought them the first weekend they were available. I was initially impressed with the comfort and felt the sound was markedly improved over the original AirPods. Active noise cancellation was cool but really no better than the passive isolation I was getting with my Liberty+. Additionally, I could never quite get the ear tip test to pass. Returned them in 2 weeks. I decided maybe The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 would be the perfect mix of AirPod convenience with Liberty+ sound and battery life. Sound was as expected from my Zolo Liberty+ experience. Touch controls were awesome as was the auto pause when removing from the ear. But for the love of all that is holy, why couldn’t they complete the circle and auto resume?!? They also just wouldn’t stay in my ear. Next up was the Sony WF-1000XM3 which were touted to be the best wireless earbuds out there. Even got them on sale but they went back 48 hours later. Did a firmware upgrade first then put them in. They are not that comfortable for me but the sound was darn good. I couldn’t wear them for more than 60 minutes at best. Again I found the ANC to be marginally better than the passive isolation I was already getting. The main problem was consistent disconnection of the right bud. This would happen a few times each hour. The ambient noise control that changes the noise cancellation automatically would be so much more awesome if it didn’t momentarily pause your music while doing so. Frustrated I decided to give the Liberty 2 Pros another shot since they were on sale and I’d read so many good things about the sound. It also helped that I had birthday money to spend. Yes 50 year olds still get birthday money from some people. They arrived from Amazon 24 hours later. I was immediately prompted to update the firmware. When I put them in I was surprised by just how comfortable they were. I actually didn’t think I had them in properly because it was effortless to get them seated properly. Then the music started. Wooo saaa! I liken my first impressions with these to the first time I listened to Shure IEMs. Well not quite that good. Those were like hearing all my music for the first time again but you get what I’m trying to say. Wow!! Among the best of those I’ve tried. Definitely on par with the Sony. Fit was great. No pass through is a downer but I don’t have many occasions to actually use it. I think I’ve found my earphones. I’ve been wearing them for 2-3 hours at a time with no discomfort at all. The isolation on these is a tad less than my Liberty+, which I used on my flights during Thanksgiving travel. I’ve noticed that while eating, these things will shift causing them to lose that really good seal and let in outside noise. I’m not a bass head so I keep the EQ flat but these things still hit hard. They will literally rattle your brain. No touch controls with these. Rather they use real buttons which, thankfully, are located on top. No more pushing the earphones farther in the ear just to skip a track. I appreciate the ability to program the buttons as well. I’m not one to use Siri except in my car, so I set them up for volume control. A most welcome feature. Battery life is just as impressive as my old Liberty+ with 8 hrs in the buds and another 24 in the case. The case is bigger than the AirPods case but much smaller than the Sony case. It's just right in the pocket. Wireless charging and USB-C are an exceptional value for this price. One thing I’ve learned is that at the moment ANC on wireless earphones is not nearly as good as over ear headphones and certainly not worth the premium price that is custom in wireless earphones...yet. Passive isolation works nearly as well for me; comparable to NRR 32 ear plugs which I use to sleep. Until I find a pair of over ear noise cancelling headphones that I can wear comfortably with eyeglasses or sunglasses for 2-3 hours while writing code, these buds will do for me. Update (1/10/2020): Software update has added a custom EQ which is a most welcome addition. This was one of the more requested features I heard in many reviews."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,You can stop looking,Out of all the wireless earbuds I've tried these far surpassed them all
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,Love these,"These are We'll worth it.. Once you get the proper fit and the best quality music you are gonna love the details in the playback high end is crisp and clear from low volume to Max and bass is quite a boost from my entry level liberty. Have yet to need a recharge these things never die.. I've used them for bike rides,jogs, gym workouts only had to plug in twice.. I've had them a month now.. Only thing wish I could get a little bit more volume.. But I'm a old club head.. I'm probably a little deaf 🤯 ... And getting some decent foam ear pieces amplifies the sound quality.. Just finding a good pair that's last more than a month might take a couple tries.. I'm already ordering another pair."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,Just Great,Best true wireless ear buds on market!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-08,Superb sound quality,Best wireless earphones ever tried! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-09,Great earbuds,Pretty awesome. Love the fact I can tune them for my ears. I have a slight hearing lose in my left ear and it helps a lot with that. Very comfortable in my ears too.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-09,The most amazing earbuds that I’ve ever owned ~ The Rolls Royce of sound reproduction,"These are the most amazing earbuds that I’ve ever owned. I tried out the Master and Dynamic MW07 Plus, Jabra 75T Elite, AirPods Pro, and these. The worst sounding of the bunch were the AirPods Pro; these completely blow them out of the water. The other two were decent, but overall the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro’s are the clear winner. The app allows you to customize the equalizer, and after doing so, and listening to music for hours on end, I can tell you that nothing comes close to these. Don’t be fooled by the low price; these are hands down the best sounding earbuds available today. They’re not the best for calls, but for music, they’ll leave you speechless."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-09,"Soundcore Liberty Pro: Good headphones, small issues","I have been searching for a pair of headphones for a while that is Bluetooth, wire-free, and that could work with just one earpiece. Sound core liberty addressed all of these requirements at a very reasonable price. The reason I am only rating this product three stars is that the original pair I received the left earpiece stopped working in less than a month. Amazon's interface made it simple to request a replacement. Now as for the actual headphones when they work I am very pleased with them. The quality of the sound is extremely good very comparable to the bose over the ear QC35 and leaps and bounds better than the other Anker headphones, Spirit X.
If the Longevity were not an issue or a concern for me I would rate the Headphones 4 stars, while they are great and for the price/value I am happy there are a number of other little issues. The plug to charge the holding case is very difficult to plug in. The headphones do play static if you are on a webpage that is trying to play an ad or during other short instances when the sound would normally play. Also for me, most earphones are very uncomfortable, while this was also the case even with the small fins I was able to remove them and can wear it for my 10-hour shifts. Hopefully the replacement will not have the same issue as the original headphones did."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-09,The hype,If it didn't give itself the hype I probably would excepted them .they have a good sell.pitch and I fell for them
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-09,These have a constant white noise static when on.,Music and videos
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-09,Unbelievable sound.,Love these earbuds. Awesome sound.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-09,Great Sounding Earbuds! Great Customer Support,"I am a headphone junkie! I am in a constant search for the best earbuds and over the ear headphones for listening to music. Last year I purchased multiple sets of each, So when a model comes along that distinguishes itself in one way or another, I want to let fellow users know about it. The Liberty Two Pro earbuds are one of those models. These earbuds sound GREAT. They are extremely lightweight, and I find them easy to insert and lock into my ear canals. The sound from these earbuds approach the openness, fullness and wide sound stage of my better pairs of over the ear headphones. The phone application that accompanies the earbuds is really an excellent addition to the package. This application allows you to select a sound profile for the type of audio you are listening to at the time. It can also test your hearing an adjust the frequency response of the earbuds to your hearing capabilities. The earbuds get a good 4 hours++ of battery time before needing to be recharged in the case. I do suggest that Anker try to improve that time, because I often use these at night time to listen to music. In my opinion, these are simply the best earbuds out there at the moment! I will add that I arrived at these earbuds because I tried another Anker model that I had problems with. Anker service was extremely patient and helpful during my move from that product to this product. They genuinely wanted me to find the best solution for my music listening needs."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-10,Great wireless ear buds,"I haven't had these for very long so I can't speak of longevity, but right out of the box these are amazing. Sound quality is great, comfortable and easy to use. My wife likes them more than her Air Pods"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-10,Ankr,Not comfortable
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-01-10,Pleasantly happy with my purchase 4.5/5,"This is my first set of wireless earbuds and I was a bit nervous buying them as they're not exactly cheap (retail$150, I pre-ordered at $100). Generally I have been very happy with them though with only a few gripes. My wired earbuds were smaller and I could sit them inside my ear fairly easily, but these require a bit of technique to sit them in your ear correctly. This alone almost made me regret buying but once I figured out how to get them in right I was much happier with my purchase, so play around with the fit for a day or two before you make up your mind. Sound quality is great, battery life is very good (as long as your put them in the charging case for 10-15 minutes every few hours when you break away to do something else they will last the whole day). Charging case is a great size and fits easily in men's jean pockets (charges with USB-C). Noise cancelling is good but you need them sitting in your ear correctly. Microphone quality is good but I don't think it does HD voice, not 100% sure. Aesthetically I feel like these don't look nearly as dumb as airpods so that's a plus. Very happy with my purchase 4.5/5 Although I feel $130 would have been a better price point than the current $150 (most wireless earbuds seem overpriced to me though)
Wishlist for these: HD voice, smaller size,"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-01-10,"Decent for wireless, sound quality is garbage compared to what their advertising.","Initially I had a lot of issues with these headphones, they had a hissing sound when they weren't playing music, I had to write the manufacturer and they had me send them back and it took about three weeks to get my new pair without the hissing sound, they offered me a partial refund which made the headphones about $80 after that, don't get me wrong there a fantastic headphone for a wireless headphone. They sound good enough, they're not fantastic when you compare them to my $20 pair of kz zst's, let's be honest they sound like hot garbage compared to my $20 KZ
ZST's, but they're fairly good with the battery life is pretty good so I guess it's worth to buy. Kind of overpriced if you ask me, for a headphone brand that is swearing by their audio quality it's kind of garbage."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Sound incredible,Sound incredible
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-01-11,Shrill highs,"There is an 8khz spike that makes these unlistenable. I really wanted to like these, but had to return them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Best earbuds yet..,Tried few of the competitor's earbuds and also budget solutions. But this one stands above the rest in quality and battery life.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-11,Pretty impressive,"Though I only got about nine hours of use instead of the ""up to 10"" hours advertised, the battery life still outdid any other similar items I shopped or tried. I use these to sleep in so the bulkiness can be a slight issue, but doable. I've been using these about a month and so far, I can honestly recommend them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,"Not perfect, but all around best.","Sound is amazing, powerful bass, build quality is solid. Customer service is the best, when I told them there is a problem about my buds, they send a new pair to me immediately."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Do not hesitate on getting these earbuds. They are awesome.,"Wow! for the price, these earbuds sound and preform like $300 earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Great sound,"I did a lot of research before buying these. For the price point, these are great. The sound is great as is the fit and function. I love the fact that you can use either the right or left or both. Calls are great as is music. Have had them for almost 6 months with no issues."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Stoning,Very good earbuds
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Good sound,Good audio but not the best at blocking background noise
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,"Great sound quality, comfortable fit and long battery life. Well worth $100!","Great sound quality, great battery life, pretty small overall size and very comfortable to wear. I tried the cheaper neo's first but wow they hurt my ears. These things are very comfortable even after an 8hr plane ride. The battery life is great and sounds quality with Bluetooth 5.0 is really good. Nice selection of tip sizes and the case is a cool design and provides plenty of juice for the 2 separate connecting ear buds. I love that I can connect either the left or the right to my device. Super handy while at work! Can listen to music in 1 ear and pay attention to my surroundings in the other ear. Will suggest to all my friends."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Great for the money,Great quality would be better with active noise cancelation
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-11,Fantastic. What else can you say?,"These are some of the best ear buds I have owned, wired or wireless. The sound is rich, the equalizers are nice if you use the app, and I like the sound customization. They fit well, and I haven't had any issues with them coming out of my ears. Others say the case is large, but I don't think so. What do you expect from something that stores the buds and charges them as well? I'm very pleased with these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-12,These a Awesome!,"I really like everything about these! The fit, sound, battery life. A company paired with Anker is one to go with. My Anker products are great and still going 5plus years later."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-12,Awesome sound,Very comfortable and sound is excellent
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-12,Best at $150 or less,"Best sounding true wireless headphones in the price range. Great bass, very detailed mids and highs. Not the most comfortable, but not the worst by far. Love them so much I bought a pair for work and a pair for home! Edit: Just recently these have developed a very noticeable hiss. Not sure if it's a recent firmware update or a problem with the unit."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-01-12,Hissing Noise,"I'm currently on my second pair and it still hisses. The sound is great if you crank it up loud enough to drown out the obnoxious staticy hiss. They're not very comfortable, they irritate my ears after a couple hours, but battery runs out by then anyway."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-12,Awesome,These sound amazing. They are the best that I have tried so far. The other plus is the app that you can use.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-12,Pretty good,"So far they are pretty good. Every once and a while though, they seems to not sync. Also occasional intermittent audio."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-13,Just sound great!,They check all the boxes.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-01-13,UPDATED: Wanted it to be one of the best,"UPDATE: I tried the different wings and tips I received with my order to no avail. Then, tried the foam tips I received complimentary with my Sony WF-1000. They fit the earbuds, but did nothing to ease the discomfort from prolonged use. I even ordered some 3rd party foam-tips specifically designed for these earbuds and they did not do much to aid my discomfort. I even tried wearing them with and without the earwings. Nothing helps the discomfort I get from wearing them more than 30 minutes. Initially, I was able to wear them for nearly 5 hours straight, but refuse to now that I'm aware of the pain in my ears. Unfortunately, this has caused me to downgrade my review to three stars. I truly wanted to love these. I LOVE my Zolo Liberty+ Backer Editions. They can be used in my ears for nearly six hours without hurting, with the standard silicone tips and wings. These just do not cut it. I'm not sure if it is the bigger drivers or the design of the encasing, but it doesn't work for me. Now I use when my Zolo's or even older Jaybird Freedom's are charging, but even then, only until one of my other pairs recharges. Original Review: I own a lot of earbuds, from many brands that I see as good brands. The Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro's are one of the best. They are just like the first gen Zolo Liberty+, except with all the features you really wanted then. Wireless charging, multiple device switching, incredible sound with bass response, usb-c compatible, premium charging case, true wireless, great range. Sound: I find the acoustical span of these little earbuds to be incredibly broad, from far into low bass to reaching highs. They do an great job clearing the acoustic palette, preparing your ears for what you are listening to. Then, there is the depth that the drivers seem to cover. Nuances that you may miss using ordinary devices are clear and beautiful in these buds. A lot of in-ears try to deliver booming bass at the expense of dynamics, but these do not do this. These deliver. Wireless charging and USB-C: It just works. Range and versatility of Bluetooth 5 - Range is great, able to even get through interference such as microwaves and dense walls. Multiple-device switching can be finicky, as you have to disconnect from the first device for it to switch to another, but works as intended. Charge & Charging Case: I've yet to have them die on me, and I've used for up to 5 hours straight without tossing them in the case. That said, I've never had to charge the case due to it dying either and I've used them for nearly five days straight without placing them on my wireless charger. They just aren't that needy. Comfort: The only drawback I would have to share is comfort. They are most certainly not the most comfortable earbuds to me, but then again, most aren't to me. I'm sure some foam-tipped earbuds would help."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-13,Amazing sound quality,Wife got them as a gift for me. Love these earbuds best I've used for wireless and rival my klipsch wired earbuds with sound quality. Only con for me is i wish the wing tips fit better or they had a moldable accessory to replace the wing tips im in the grey zone of smedium. A moldable product the decibullz would be amazing with these. But this hasn't stopped me from enjoying them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-13,Amazing!,"These are the best ,for sound,noise cancelling, bass, everything im glad I bought these, they are simply the best! !"

2. Wish it is more louder at max volume"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-13,Sounds great,The sound is phenomenal. I can hear the instruments clearly. You would notice the difference if you compared it to Apple Air Pods

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-13,A good buy for a $100.00 !!!,They sound really good. For me I would prefer more bass and phone calls aren’t that good with these. Now if you like to listen to music these are a great buy. I just personally would prefer more bass and better ability to make clear phone calls !!! Good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-13,"Sounds great, but too much highs","Sounds very clear in all ranges (highs, mids, lows), the bass is enhanced but still sharp. Fit is alright, but I prefer if it came with foam tips. It had a tendency to register certain highs (like 's' sounds, cymbals) as tinny and piercing. Had to give these away"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-13,Price,Very good product
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-14,Great earbuds for the price.,"Great battery life, amazing sound. Would recommend 10/10"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-14,Quite Possibly the BEST Earbuds EVER Conceived,"TINY. HECK'N. SUBWOOFERS. in your ears! These are truly amazing. Never before have I thought of having TWO speakers per ear in a wireless earbud, but these changed that. The sound quality is spot on and the way these carry themselves is equally as fantastic. I haven't been able to find a true thing I dislike about them from purchase, but I will be honest when I say I did not expect such superior sound AND microphone quality from a pair of wireless ear buds. Pros:
- Fantastic battery life
- Fast recharge
- Superior sound quality
- Tweeter & Subwoofer individual speakers in EACH earbud
- Can use one at a time
- Fantastic design, fits well
- Everything else
And at what cost? Cons:
- None."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-14,High Frequencies are TOO High,"I wanted to like these, but the high frequencies are turned up way too far (past 8k hz). The highs go past the mids and lows. You can't turn these up as loud as you would like without piercing your ears and causing ear fatigue. The presets help, but not enough. Tried the largest ear bud size as well. Had to return these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-14,Pretty great,"Been using it for almost a month now. I was skeptic as most while buying since I had not used any Soundcore product in past. I was a jaybird x3 user before this, and the sound quality is a bit better than jaybirds for sure. I like bass heavy sound to its lines well with that, otherwise I can change the preset settings if I am listing to something different. There is nothing negative that I have noticed so far. it would have helped if the case had a mechanism to hang with keys or something. If you are wearing tight jeans it's a little big to keep in the pocket. The case doesnt have sharp edges so that helps."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-14,Great with phone...not so with laptop.,"Ear buds work great with my cell phone, but the bluetooth connection with my laptop leaves much to be desired."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-14,"Great fit, quality, and sound!","I own multiple TWS earbuds, including the Jabra 65t Elite and the Tozo T6. These are definitely the most comfortable! The sound quality is great, but not as good as my 65t's. Call quality is great so far too, as I use these primarily in my work van while driving, with no complaints from anyone about call quality issues. I have found that with the 3 sets of buds I own, volume is still not the greatest. These do get plenty loud, but just a few more ticks of max volume would be perfect. The 65t's do seem to get a little louder than the Liberty 2 Pros. I was able to get a good deal for these with a coupon through YouTube a few months ago, which I paid $120 total. Definitely worth that price. $150? Naw, I don't think so. I paid $155 for the Jabras, and those have more options like hear through (although the hear through is VERY difficult to get used to when using them for a long period of time). Overall, if you can find a good deal for these and pay less than $150, then these are definitely worth it! For me, these are the most comfortable ear buds I've ever come across! UPDATE:
After owning these now for a few months, I'm even more impressed! The Soundcore app now has a custom EQ!! This solves the previous problem of not quite loud enough that I stated before. After spending more time listening to music (heavy metal🤘), I now believe these are just as good, if not slightly better than the sound quality of my Jabra 65t Elites. When cranked to max volume, there is little to no distortion! Very impressive! O, and I failed to mention before, I have NOT had any hissing or static noise at lower volumes, as some have stated to have this issue. Now I still can't bring myself to bump up my rating to a 5⭐ rating, as no hear through is definitely a feature that is missing from these bad boys. BUT, I definitely still believe these are the MOST comfortable ear buds I've ever used, IMO!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-14,Wow!!!,"Amazing! These headphones surpassed my expectations. Now for a disclaimer I did hear the ""hiss"" that some people complain about but the overall experience is truly out of this world. If it wasn't for that I would give them 5 stars. I was also lucky to find these for 109 bucks when they were on sale but at that price point they would destroy the competition at that price point. Everyone talks about the ""soundstage"" now I see why. With the app and the eq settings you can listen to any genre of music and enjoy everything you listen to. It's hard to describe but it's like having a concert in your head. If you are on the fence and see these on sale don't hesitate to get them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-15,Amazing sound quality!,"These earbuds are the real deal. The sound quality of these is unbelievable. Very crispy, clear sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-15,Worth the money,"These are great earbuds, good fit, great sound for a good price. I had the privilege of being these at a discount. Thank you @Anker."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-15,Good set of earbuds.,"Holy mother of bass! Wow these things bring the thump.. love the sound quality and they are well built. Fit well in your ears too, very comfortable."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-15,Good,Size is too big but sound quality is good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-15,Solid,"Sometimes when using headphones to talk on the phone, the other person says I'm really low or they cant hear me. Other then that, great pair of buds. Couldn't be happier"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-15,Way Betta than those AirPods,"So I just bought this and I will update a couple months from now. I am pleasantly surprised! If you are a bass person this is for you! R&B, HipHop and House sounds amazing. This is way better than AirPods and I love the app that allows controls to certain genres of music. This is great for the gym or plane rides. The only downside is the noise cancel, I live in NYC and I like to be aware of my surroundings lol but if you ain’t tryna be bothered these are awesome. Also the look is a bit bulky for me so I’ll be switching between my AirPods and these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-15,Great buy for truly wireless headphones,"They sound way better than the apple pro, and the Samsung buds"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-15,"Great Playback Quality, Good Battery Life, but the Mics Are For Calls Only (No Recording)",The audio quality is really great. Perfect for the gym and podcasts. The only thing I'd change is a little more headroom (+5db would be great) and to enable the mics to record (currently for calls only). That second one may be a firmware updatable thing.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-15,So disappointing.,"The sound from these is really good for the price. Loud without distortion, kicking base. Except for the constant static when not playing any sound. I actually have to turn these down. 👍 Unfortunately, the battery life is annoying. Right bud runs out at about 5 hours, which would be fine but left continues for another 2-3 hours?? So it feels defective. And case will only recharge buds twice not the three times?? So play time for both buds is about 15 hours total. The Liberty neo's will do that with a better noise canceling fit at just $50. At $150 the sound isn't that much better to warrant poor battery life. Not to mention they advertise up to 8hrs with 3 recharges. I received a replacement set really easily. But same problems. Ending up returning. That being said I'll keep an eye out for an update version of these. I like anker and am hoping they will take care of it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-15,"Amazing Sound, but annoying white noise","I was really looking forward to getting my soundcores, even though I've read some reviews complaining about a white noise or ""his"" on the earphones. Thinking that Anker would've definitely fixed this issue, i ordered them without any concern. Sadly enough, my earphones have this problem. its most noticeable between tracks, and when listening to very soft audio. When contacting Anker, they seem to know of the issue, but claim that i have the ""fixed version"". anyway, they offered me a partial refund, claiming their engineers are working on this matter and there is not much else they can do to help. Other than that, the sound is great, they sit comfortably in place, and the app is great. Although i wouldn't recommend buying them if you have a sensitive ear which will almost definitely pick up the white noise."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-16,AMAZING BETTER THAN AIRPODS !!!!,"I love them. They are great, the only thing is you can hear the static and it’s not perfectly silent when you don’t have anything playing, but a small price to pay for the sound quality. You hear so much more in all the songs!!! It’s really cool! Also I recommend 8d audio songs 🤤"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-01-16,Excellent sound but horrible comfort,"The L2P is an excellent wireless earbud with powerful clean crisp sound that will suit an audiofiles taste. Battery life is superb and the design of the earbuds looks classy and sleek on your ears. The only downside, and this is a major downside...is the comfort. After 1hr or so ear pain starts setting in due to the design of the earbuds. The earbuds sit nicely in the ear canal but its the hard bulge which houses the driver is where the discomfort lies. If these earbuds fit you comfortably then these are the best bang for the buck. Otherwise, no matter the sound quality, if it doesnt feel great on the ears, then its just paperweight."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-16,I bought Jaybird Vistas... Ended up keeping the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro instead.,"So around Black Friday/Cyber Monday, I ordered a pair of Jaybird Vistas to supplant my Apple AirPods. And for those few weeks before Christmas I tried to enjoy them. Sure, they had a better seal than the AirPods, they kept put in my ears wonderfully during a gym session, nice case w/ mini lanyard, and a multi-pair function. However, there was something missing, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Those Vistas had a decent seal, a good snug fit - not uncomfortable, but not necessarily comfortable enough (read to find out). Overall sound quality was similar to AirPods (before using custom EQ settings, again, read to find out) and it's overall 16-hour battery life begged the question; Were these Vistas, for $180 - a $20 premium over baseline AirPods, a suitable replacement for those very AirPods when the SQ is the same, and have a lesser overall battery capacity?? Enter: the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro. About a week, week-and-a-half maybe, before Christmas, Amazon decided to put a discount on both their Liberty Air 2 (LA2, for short) and Liberty 2 Pro (LP2, for short). Decided to give the LA2 a shot. For me, the LA2's were a two day affair. In my conclusion, the Vistas seemed to have more worth than the LA2, even though for the price the LA2's were a steal; they were more comfortable than the Vistas, but didn't seem to stay put in my ears as well as the Vistas, or even, ironically, my AirPods for the matter, and pairing the LA2's for some reason was a nightmare (although this doesn't seem to be the case w/ the Liberty Pro 2's), so that was that. I returned the LA2's, and moved on w/ getting ready for the holidays. Two days before Christmas, I noticed Amazon still had the Liberty Pro 2's on sale, and knowing it definitely wouldn't be discounted after the holidays for awhile; I pulled the trigger on a pair of the Liberty 2 Pros for $40 off. When I finally got the LP2's, I spent a good 2-2.5 weeks comparing and contrasting the Jaybird Vistas and the Soundcore LP2's. In regards to sound, the Vistas achieved only decent sound quality in conjunction with using the custom EQ on the Jaybird app. On the other hand; the LP2, right off the bat, sounded just as good - if not better; better detail and an equal amount of bass w/ the default EQ option, than the EQ'd Vistas. Using the HearID feature of the Soundcore app in conjunction with the LP2's completely leveled any candle the Vistas were trying to hold in the sound quality department. Sound was lively, all the little details came to life. I'm by no means an expert in audio, or a sound engineer, but I do have to give credit to the dual-driver construction on the LP2's, the Knowles balanced armature that handles the highs and the 11mm dynamic driver that handles the mids & lows work so amazingly in tandem. All your favorite songs become a smorgasbord of fine audio detail; you're left noticing all the nuances your favorite artist put together in their songs: vocals, instruments, synths, you name it. The overall sound quality is incredibly rich and detailed with the LP2. Fit & comfort were a plus on the LP2's over the Vistas. I was worried that they'd fall out during strenuous or constant activity because they stick out at lot more than the Vista's, let alone AirPods, but the earfins kept tension which helped the LP2's stay in place, even during gym workouts. Originally using Jaybird Vistas supplied with their earfin sleeves were quite painful, and using the sleeve without an earfin only lessened the discomfort, not alleviate it; I could only wear the Vistas for 2-3 hrs. tops before my ears felt fatigued. Contrasting that with the LP2's, using their smallest earfin, and their medium-sized ear tips were a lot more comfortable with little to no fatigue whatsoever (looking up ear anatomy, it seems that I have a small cavum, which would explain why I'm one of those people who can keep AirPods on w/o them falling out, and why I would get so fatigued fairly soon w/ the Vistas). There are 7 different sizes of silicone ear tips, and 3 different sizes of earfins, so, one can get the optimum fit for their ears. Of course though, as everyone's ears are different, your mileage will vary. After comparing the two for these past few weeks; eventually preferring the LP2's more than the Vistas day-by-day, it's not all rays of sunshine when it comes using the LP2. There's a very rare occurrence where the L and R buds won't pair together, sometimes requiring a disconnect then re-connect on the preferred device, although rare, it is something to keep in mind. In contrast to the Vistas; there's no multi-pair function, which means whenever you'd like to connect, let's say to your tablet from your phone, you have to disconnect them from your phone and then pair them to the tablet, or vice versa, so on so forth. Or, you'd have to put them back in the case, press the pairing button on the case, and connect that way if you'd prefer. Mutli-pair is so much easier and much more convenient on the Vistas (and the AirPods), and I hope it can be incorporated in a firmware update (along w/ the rumored noise-canceling feature I've been hearing about in the web looking up these Soundcores) for the LP2's. Bluetooth quality is stellar on the LP2's, and - aside from the L & R issue - would never cut out as I was listening to music. Given that the LP2's are very comfortable, this is not that big of a deal-breaker for me, but they do stick out of the ear, reminiscent of the Sony XM3's true wireless earbuds or one of those single bud cellular headsets from the 2000's. It may be quite a deterrent for some, but I would justify it; seeing as Anker were able to fit two drivers, Bluetooth 5.0 components, and an 'oversized' battery, which allows for 8 hr. playback time in both the left and right earbud, the bigger size is worth it in this case. The playback time of the LP2's alone is leaps and bounds over the AirPods (5 hrs.) I've been using, and has the edge over the Vistas (6 hrs.). I average about 2-4 hrs. of use between any true wireless earbud per day, so the increased endurance is a welcome update. The charging case looks like a smooth large pebble, or one of those fancy bars of soap, it definitely has a slight heft when the earbuds are inside. It is a bit bulky, but it's certainly not the behemoth of true wireless earbud cases, it is slightly bigger than the Vista's charge case, and significantly bigger than the AirPods charging case. That said though, it is still very pocketable, the 8 hr. playtime of the LP2 is supplemented by an additional 24 hrs. in the charging case, totaling to 32 hrs. of overall use before having to charge the LP2's via USB-C (a major plus) or by the Qi wireless charging-standard. This is in contrast to the Jaybird Vista which only have a 10 hr. reserve on its charging case to supplement the 6 hr. playtime of its earbuds, tallying only 16 hrs. total. The Soundcore case, like the AirPods case, can easily be opened one-handed, which is a nice ergonomic touch. The Soundcore app shows you how much battery is left in each individual earbud during use, you can also customize what function is done on the button of each bud - the buttons on the LP2 earbuds are also convenient; mounted on top of the unit instead of the side, so a press of the button isn't unintentionally trying to jam the earbuds into your ear. Along with a whole array of EQ options, including the HearID personal custom EQ feature, the app also offers firmware updates for the 'buds. Using the app is very smooth and it does what it was made to do. All-in-all, for $40 off, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro are a great, quality, value. Even with its flaws it's definitely worth a buy. After using them for a few weeks I definitely enjoy them, quirks and all. If you're looking for true wireless earbuds w/ great playback time, a charging case that has an additional charge for a full 24 hrs., superbly great sound quality; this is the one. Definitely scoop up this pair when Amazon has them on sale."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-16,These earbuds are a big advance over last generation Bluetooth Sound Capability,"Gave these earbuds to my daughter for Xmas. She has a new generation Samsung phone with the latest version 5.0 Bluetooth next gen Sound encoding capability. She said ""These earbuds are awesome. There is so much more being broadcast in the sound-field than before. It is amazing to realize that I could only hear about half of the music being broadcast in earlier generation earbuds."""

Other then the air pod pros these are definitely the best headphones I've ever used, extremely comfortable, customizable wings and tips to they'll fit any ear perfectly, amazing sound quality and with the sound core app you can play around with the equalizer to make the quality perfect for you, and of course, a battery life to rival Jesus."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-01-16,They are good until they’re not,I love these earphones they’re really nice but I’ve used them for about 30 days and one of them lost connection through Bluetooth and cannot get it to work yet similar to what happens with AirPods from Apple.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-17,"Best earbuds, only a single big problem, edit; but great customer service","The best sounding headphones ive ever had, with a catch...
I'm no audiophile or whatever ya wanna call it, but these are great for rock, metal, rap, pop, just about anything with a lot going on in the background
But theres a loud hissing which ruins just about any song that doesn't have a lot of instruments and classical music, or even just watching a youtube video
For the week that ive used these, they've been amazing, never had to charge the case once, battery life on the earbuds were great too, but the hiss is too much, hope liberty 3 pros can fix this. I'm waiting for my refund so far, ups says they have dropped it off but I've received no update from Amazon or anker, so I'm not sure how good they are on customer service
Edit: Ankers customer service has been great... better than anyother customer service ive had so far, I'd recommend these headphones over anyother at this price and even higher, unless you listen to classical music and other quieter songs constantly, get these"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-17,"Sound quality is mind blowing ,but the hissing sound is the achilles heel","If I'm listening to a podcast ,then I can definitely hear the hissing sound. If the music is loud even ,then the hissing sound will be masked. I'm getting a replacement pair to see if the issue persists. Otherwise, it is totally worth $150."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-17,Impressive sound quality for the price,"The sound quality of these earbuds is quite impressive. At first, I struggled to get a proper seal with the tips provided in my right ear. I guess my ear canals are different from each other. I purchased a pair of XL tips (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015UG6K9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This made a world of difference! I used these on a daily basis while commuting to/from NYC. Sound quality: Great as long as you can get a good seal. (5 stars)
Comfort: They aren't the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn, but you get used to them. (3.5 stars)
Noise isolation: ok as long as you can get a good seal. (3 stars)
Battery Life: Great. I haven't used them for more than 3 hours at a time. So far so good (5 Stars)
Overall, I think they are a great value for the cost."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-17,Finally wireless earbuds that stay connected AND sound fantastic!,"These Anker Liberty 2 Pro earbuds are wonderful. They have rich, full sound on both my phone and my PC and are capable of tons of base. Connectivity issues are non-existent, and they support APT-X for incredible sound. The Liberty 2 Pro earbuds come with an additional 12 different earbud tips and 4 ear tensioners. The sound is full, and the base response is fantastic (especially if you have a graphic equalizer in your music app). I am using these for gaming on my PC and they are plenty loud once you turn on Loudness Equalization and Bass Boost (for Windows PCs). The wireless charging works great, and the earbuds themselves charge quickly and have long battery life. I've gamed for over 4 hours with these in my ears and the battery was still 'high'. Personally I'm happy about this, but others might think it's a downside - The earbuds have physical buttons instead of tap sensors. The buttons are on the top of the earbuds and are easy to reach. I have no complaints."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-17,Really nice earbuds,"My first pair had a dud left earbud and I had to have a replacement set sent out. It would not pair, even after multiple tries. Amazon customer service was great as usual and the replacements arrive promptly and paired on the first try. The return process for the defective pair was a breeze too."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-17,Amzing earbuds,"OK, I was a bit skeptical about all the hype on these earbuds, but yo, these are the real deal. When I first paired them to my Oneplus 7 pro I was not convinced but after some tweaking of the EQ settings what a difference. These are the ones I will use daily. I am not experiencing any hissing what so ever even on low volume. I have read that that seems to be a major issue but on my pair there is no hissing (maybe its the firmware update).. I have never heard of this brand before but I am a fan now.. I'll be chillin with these earbuds for a while.."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-18,Great bang for the buck,I was really skeptical about these but decided to give them a run. Glad I did. Sound quality is great. There are better out three but for 2x-3x the price of these and these aren’t far off from the major brands. Battery life is fantastic. Once paired they pair automatically instantly every time.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-18,Incredible headphones,Omg these headphones are my life right now!! You can customize it to fit in your ear!! Plus use the app to customize the sound. My boyfriend also has some and we also bought some for his dad.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-18,3+ stars sound quality is phenomenal I have multiple $150+ headphones these are the best of them,One headphone discharges faster then the other I get about 6 hours of battery life and sometimes have issues getting one earbud to charge
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-19,Not perfect but better than most expensive ones,"*plus be advised I have a natural biased against wireless headphones and mice*
So you must be asking yourself why are ppl so uninformed and buying crappy apple products that are expensive and worthless? Hell I don't know but if your looking for quality headphones that outperform apple earpods in price and sound these are it. Don't bother with the anker liberty air two those aren't good either. I had these for about three months and they are fantastic but far from perfect. I'll say I have used the Samsung galaxy buds and apple earpods 2 pro (don't worry I didn't buy them) also my Sony extra bass wired earbuds and will be comparing them n maybe the app last. Pros:
-fantastic bass tho not as punchy and nice as the wired Sony ones it still beats Samsung and apple by miles. aesthetic look: while subjective Its nice i just wish it had more red. -battery life: well I own anker battery and chargers so tho I'm impressed I'm not blown away cuz its anker battery life is awesome. Low battery? Charge for ten minutes boom u have an hour more. -tho good if you put them on right and clean and dry your ears these won't fall out. However this depends again on u putting them on correctly if not these will pop out and fall out easily. By putting on correctly I mean holding them vertically gently pushing the tip inside your ear all the way and then slowly rotating it so the wing locks inside the I guess nook of your ear? -clarity and sound stage beats the competition
-water resistant not waterproof very good in this regard you can't submerge them but rain and sweat won't damage them. -carrying case:really nice oval design great battery life and tho they won't scramble while inside if you pop the lid and shake hard they will fall out. -wireless charging: tho I am against wireless charging for phones I bought an anker wireless charger for these n its superb fast too tho I have an anker fast charging brick too so your miles many vary. -app tho I'll talk about it later the equalizer kills it! (Meaning it improves sound sugnificantly)
-customer service: tho I dealt with them years ago n they were nice (not about earbuds but charging cables) they really surprised me if anything is wrong they will help and are really awesome tbh. -volume:they are louder than samsung and apple but they don't distort at all and sound awesome but they aren't super loud either
-physical button : these are league's better than the finicky touch controls on other earbuds its crisp easy but precise to press. -you can charge one earbud and listen to stuff with just one it will just pause. -good passive noise cancelling
Well like I said not perfect...
Cons:
-microphone: so on phone calls these are not as good as apple or samsung. They are not trash and horrible but there have been times ppl say I found far away and or underwater, also u have to have both of them on for ppl to hear u when its working properly. -fit: so tho they are better than apple and anker liberty air newest version they are inferior to the Samsung Galaxy buds. They require ur ears to be clean dry and like I wrote above correctly inserted or they will fallout. The galaxy buds are brainless and just easy to have them fit. - no independent/ dedicated volume rocker or physical buttons. This was disappointing sir u can use ur phone but it's not the same n yes u can remap thru the app but not enough recaps like triple taps n it doesn't work properly and you can't adjust it in the app like if I press the button I can't adjust how much volume up or down it goes per activation so it will go very slow in both spectrums. -no earbud finder, so these are small n wireless n they are easy to lose especially when u fall asleep and the fall off but the app has no earbud finder. -volume boost tho they are loud not all music is and it be nice to have a volume booster. -limited color options
-not ipx7 rated like alot of newer ones. -disconnect issues I have experienced a couple tho rare where in a phone call or listening to something left earbud would distort or disconnect, one time I thought it broke n I got heated n contacted anker n they had me unpair and reset the earbuds n it fixed the issues
-no active noise cancelling (I don't really need or care about it, the passive does a pretty good enough job in the NYC crowded and noisy subway)
-no passthrough mode (again I don't need it but if ur in school or at work depending might be a con)
-when not listening to anything you can hear some hissing but never heard any while listening to stuff so ppl who experienced this might need a firmware update or theirs is defective. -no multiple devices pairing? I mean it can be convenient but how difficult is pairing to begin with? [The app]
Well it has actually improved since the first time I used it.. but first it has a ton of profiles depending on the music n preference you like. They have a custom hearing ID mode where it tests ur hearing but it was disappointing so I just prefer the profiles. But they updated it now where they actually have a full blown equalizer so u can tweak n customize to your liking but that's really it. ....
So to sum it up as far as I'm aware unless something better has come out at this price since decemberish this is the best sound in price and performance and tho it can have improvements to wipe out the competition it's a solid foundation and this is coming from someone who prefers wired but not an audiophile."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-19,Great Sound for your dollar,Absolutley live them. My husband and I both bought a pair and they are beyond great. Love the extra ear pieces to help fit in our ears better. Also live the case and bettery life. I purchased in early december and charged them for the first time a week ago. Thus was with moderate use.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-19,"I didn't keep them, I got the beats 3 and I am way happier",Sound was excellent but not loud and not bassy enough
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-19,Best ever,I'm beastin over here. Not a real word but it's TRUE. Haven't even downloaded the app. Personally their is no need. I'm good. It last for me day and some. Have not the words for this product. I'm buying some more fa sho. Not a technical person but I know music and sound. This is this stuff people. Best $150 I have spent on some stereo headsets.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-20,Promising step up!,"I really like these earbuds, except I find them hard to fit so they stay in while I'm hiking. Also, I find them too quiet even at full volume. The quality of sound is very good but lacks volume for me, but the most disappointing attribute is the secure fit issue"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-20,Top 3 on the market,I love them. I have no issues.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-20,Best true wireless earbuds out there,"Buy these instead of spending money with the Fruit. These have better sound, better battery life, better fit, and are a fraction of the cost. The app to make eq and other adjustments is even decent! If you care about image, buy the white ones from the Fruit. If you care about sound, fit, and battery life, by these, you won’t regret it, and you’ll save money too!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-20,Had high hopes but was let down!,I bought this product with very high hopes. They seemed very cutting-edge with their dog drivers and each year bud so I expected the sound quality to be excellent. I was let down and I return this product. I heard a constant buzzing sound out of the right earbud and to be honest the bass was not very clear. I think the concept is great however these seriously need to be reviewed by an engineer and some enhancements made before releasing these to the market.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-20,affordable price for good earbuds,good price for a good wireless earbud
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-20,You Should Know...,"These are very highly rated wireless earbuds, and I would've given them 5 stars except for the fact that I like to fall asleep with earbuds in, but these are just a little to large (deep) to comfortably sleep on my side. Otherwise, I would've given them 5 stars."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,Great product,Ease of use
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,Almost too good,"The sound quality ia off the charts. Compare these to my wireless Beats and this makes Beats brand sound like bargain basement brand. No contest. Great for work calls- even at the airport! It's not flawless, but these earbuds definitely isolate the users voice over background noise
Amazing for working out
Only drawback- the noise isolation is SO GOOD I find myself keeping one earbud loose to hear background noise. Could not be more pleased"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,Good quality for the price!,Way better than airpods and 1/3 the price!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,Great Sound,"Might have some difficulty Synching the Left and Right Earbud. However, once this is done, they are great!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,Prepare to have your mind blown literally!,Amazing Audio! Sound better than my Beats Studio 3 wireless in both overall audio quality and head rocking Bass! Was sceptical but I couldn't be happier with them! Still can't believe such sound is possible with earbuds!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,Great quality of sound,I bought these for my son and he loves the quality of sound it gives.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-21,"Best sound I heard from earbuds, ever.",The only thing I miss with the earbuds is that there is no way to increase the volume except through the device connected to the earbuds. Otherwise I love my earbuds and I am glad my husband didn’t listen to me and went ahead and bought me a set like his.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-21,Still they are a good buy,What I like about the product was its ease of Bluetooth connectivity great sound quality but I did not like this simply just not loud enough even though I know the manufacturers are concerned about hearing loss that should be up to the discretion of the listener overall I think they should sell for about 60 to $70 and not $102
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-22,I really wanted to like these!,So I read a bunch of reviews on these and I needed to try them. I had them for about a week and thought that would be enough time to break my ears and the buds in. Unfortunately I'm just one of those that the tips didnt fit. I tried pretty much every combination and still couldn't get a comfortable fit. I'd ether get them to stay in my ear and have pain or they would be to loose and fall out and not a good seal for sound. I would urge anyone to try them out and give them a shot!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-22,Sound quality,"Love the sound, the ease of portability along with the case, beyond expectations."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-22,Amazing Earbuds,"These are great for the price! Id go as far to say audiophile level sound quality if not very close. The sound separation between bass and high end is phenomenal. I must say i think the EQ settings are very drastic. I wish they had a setting to manually control the EQ. These have a very V-shaped sound, which I personally enjoy, but its not an accurate representation of sound by any means. I have read reviews where people have complained about hissing , maybe they released a new version but i have not had this problem. They also sound much much better than any Airpods. The microphones work well except when its very windy out. The Airpods/AIrpod pros mic seems to be a better in this regard. Noise-cancellation in an earbud is also kind of unnecessary. Even on the train in NYC I have very little noise bleeding through with a good seal. Soundcore/Anker has really stepped up there game here. Kudos."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-22,great earbuds,My son loves his earbuds. He says they sound so awesome. And he can differentiate the different tones and highs and low sounds. He says they're very comfortable. His only complaint is that he would like them to be LOUDER! I'm thankful they're not! I prefer he not lose his hearing :)
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-22,Soundstage + CLEAN BASS!!!,"The bass is strong and perfect. They bang hard and clear while not overpowering the nicely balanced mids and highs. I'm used to listening though my Audioquest Nighthawks headphone, Schiit amp, and Schiit multibit dac setup on my home desktop PC. Tidal HiFi & Master tracks. About a $700 setup. Definitely not the best as audio can get stupid expensive, but damn good for the price range. These earbuds feel like I have a compact version of all that with me while I use them at the gym. Of course the dynamic range and soundstage can't be matched but these do a damn good job of trying and they sound amazing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-23,Solid buy,"Pretty good, got it when it was $40 off, not sure if I would buy them for $150. Sound quality is good. Battery is good. The product is overall solid. That is all"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-01-23,Good bass,"Good bass, Great sound. However its a little difficult to remove the buds from the case."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-23,Save your money,Buy now!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-23,Anker SoundCRAP TureCRAP headphones is what they should be called,"Anker Soundcrap True Crap headphones dont waste your money... earplugs have better sound quality than these amd I'm not talking moise cancellation, no even tho ear plugs dont play music EAR PLUGS still have better sound quality (even with the Soundcrap EQ App which basically does nothing). Do yourself a favor save some $50+ and buy a pair of 1MORE true wireless headphones or just about anything other than these would probably be a safe bet"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-23,"They stay in, stay charged and are a great price.","They sound pretty good overall. I Certainly can’t hear any background noises. Although, I’m still partial to my beats. The soundcores have a bit of tinny sound to them while my beats have more bass. That being said though they keep just as good of a charge and I like the case better than the beats. And soundcore were so generous to include all the different size ear pieces to swap into for those who can’t normally keep earbuds in their ears ( like me). The fit is totally secure."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-23,Best ear pods we’ve bought!!,"Best quality ear pods I’ve ever tried and bought!! It comes with so many options for the customization for them to fit in your ears, so if one is smaller/larger than the other, you can adjust the ear pieces that are plastic (forgive my forgetfulness of their name) and I love the app that comes with these, studio quality is a nice way of saying mind blowing my great quality ear pods for a great price!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-23,Best sound quality,This is the best sounding true wireless earphones that money can buy.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-24,Great Earbuds At A Reasonable Price- Much Better Than Apple AirPods For Less Money,"The best way to review these earbuds is to compare them to the Apple AirPods I've used for the past few months:
-Things That Are Better Than AirPods:
- The sound quality is much better than the AirPods. This is partially due to them being fully in-ear with a silicone earpiece which really enhances the sound, but there's more to it than that. The bass is extremely good due to the larger-than-normal 11mm driver. It really pounds, especially if you put the equalizer in Rock mode. You might get slightly better sound from more expensive ear buds, but these are pretty damn good. - The battery life of the buds themselves is better. I get about 7-8 hours out of these, while the AirPods need a ""nap"" in their case after about 5 hours. - They're more comfortable. With eight different silicone tips to choose from and five inner ear holders, if you can't find a fit that feels like you have nothing in your ears, you don't have anything resembling normal human ears. They stay in more securely than the AirPods, also, (although, as I note below, they aren't quite as easy to put in your ears). - The app is amazing and includes a hearing program that can be used to customize the buds to your exact hearing levels at different frequencies. This worked well, although I still prefer to choose ""Rock"" from the many set options. - The price is quite a bit less than the AirPods. These have a wireless recharging case and the AirPods with that feature are about $50 more. - Purely subjective, but I find them much more estheticly pleasing in my ears. I always felt a bit dorky with the long, white ends of the AirPods sticking down. These buds, while not invisible in your ears, are certainly much less noticeable. - Things That Are Worse Than AirPods:
- While these buds have buttons on them to allow you to do things like advance songs without going to your phone, they are extremely small and hard to use. The simple tap on an AirPod is much preferable. - Not everyone likes the fact that when you take a single AirPod out of your ear, the music pauses, but I think that is awesome. These don't do that. - They are a bit harder to install in your ears. The AirPods pop in with almost no effort or thought. These take a bit of practice to get seated well, but that's true of almost all buds that use silicone tips. As mentioned above, those tips really help to seal in the great sound, so it's worth the small extra work. - The recharging case, while pretty cool with it's clamshell opening, is considerably bigger than the sleek AirPod case."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-24,"Purchase New, receive Used!!!","Package is broken badly, all protect films are removed, looks used one."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-24,Best True Wireless Earbuds Ever,"Sound is crisp, loud & full of all the sounds you never heard. New technology brings great sound from both drivers & the price is right."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-24,But them now.,Best earbuds ever love them and anker.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-24,Update - Anker Customer Service Rocks!,"Update:
Anker Customer Service is the bomb! Without solicitation, Anker reached out to me and sent me a replacement unit. I did not have to return the original. Either I had a defective unit, or they fixed an underlying issue. I have not had any connection issues, either between the buds or to my cell phone. I've had them for about 2 weeks, and use them 4 about 3-4 hours/day. All the pros I mentioned in the original review are still there. Great Customizable sound profile via the app, great fit, super long battery life. Others have mentioned a hiss. I have not experienced this. In terms of fit, one thing I've noticed for a more secure fit is rotating them forward once in the ears, like a cork screw. I also fiddled with the ear tips and ear wings to get the perfect combo. As for the old ones, I've left them at work and use the 1 ear bud like a head set when making phone calls. Pros:
Sound quality is top notch, especially when adjusting with the app.
Noise isolation and comfort is very good with alot of ear tip options. Battery life is awesome with the case. Pros:
really only 1 and it is a huge one. The left ear bud regular does not connect, does not turn on when case opens. Then trying to reconnect is a time suck and huge hassle. Frequently have to reset the whole thing to factory settings, and then re-pair with my phone. I use this every day, and it happens probably every 3-4 days. I'm getting to the point that I just grab my wired Shure's instead. Anker really needs to fix this. Essentially becomes an unusable product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-25,Sound,I like the look the way it stay in the ear the case I just like everything about them
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-25,"Fantastic sound, nice build quality, and good tech","Excellent sound - best I’ve heard from ear buds. Clear highs and mids, with only a slight bass emphasis. I agree with other reviewers who say the sound stage is really good for ear buds. It surprised me how open they sound. Fit is pretty good, with lots of tips and wings to try. The hybrid tips are a big improvement over the basic silicon or foam tips. Still, I wish I could get a little tighter fit on my right ear - wish they included a tip that could fit a little deeper. Battery life was great. I have not run out unexpectedly yet. The case is very nice, but it’s stupid and not at all intuitive how they orient into the case - tip: take the right bud out of your ear with your left hand (and vice versa), and they’ll naturally line up better when you go to put them into the case. Overall they sound amazing for the price, they look great and fit pretty well, and they have great battery life and fast charging. Definitely one of the best ear buds in the $150 range."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-26,Best earbuds from under $500. You won't regret.,"I tried several different wireless earbuds. I tried the sennheiser (good sound but major battery issues), the Sony's (Zero bass, battery life and noise cancellation was terrible), Samsung (just ok), the Klipsch (just ok sound, but the ear buds felt cheap). Then I decided let's try Anker's. First off make sure you try every ear bud tips. Once you find the right one, the bass sounds Amazing. These sound as good if not better then the $300 sennheiser for less then half. They also fit the best. The sennheiser would fall out if you coughed. To sum it up, I am very picky. I would give these a 9 out of 10. Best bass for a earbud. The mids and highs are very good too. Also top notch on the box design. Mic could be better, that's the only complaint here."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-26,Great wireless earbuds,They sound great I was impressed with the sound quality and comfort in my ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-26,Great product,"Excellent earbuds. Great sound. Compared these earbuds to several others (Airpods, Jabra, Powerbeats, Sony) and found these to be the best in sound and comfort."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-27,Simply Awesomeness!,These are just awesome! Good clean deep full sound! Just buy them! You won’t regret it!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-27,"Good quality, poor connectivity","I previously had Bose Soundsport earbuds, which were good, but I use them so much that I wanted better battery life. First, the good: the battery life on these Anker earbuds is fantastic. Occasionally, one of the two will not fully charge, but the fact that the case can be wirelessly charged, and that each earbud can function independently of the other makes this a five star feature in my book; the sound quality and the noise cancelling are also top notch. I have no complaints there. However, at least once a day I have to completely re-pair these to my phone. No other bluetooth product I own has this issue, so I don't believe it's my phone, but just in case, I have a Pixel 3XL. The bluetooth menu on my phone shows that the earbuds are paired, but they won't play anything, any the sound goes to my phone's speaker, even when the earbuds are selected as the output option. I haven't been able to find any fixes for this besides doing a hard reset...which is easy enough, but it's a hassle to need to do this 1-3 times per day. If I had to buy another pair, I'd probably go back to Bose, even though the Anker has great features otherwise."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-01-27,Anker Soundcore is still figuring it out.,"I bought these back in September directly from the Soundcore website as an early adopter. I figured that Anker is pretty generous with its warranty and return policy that it was worth the purchase to try them out. Especially since they were only $99 at the time. My previous headphones were the OG Liberty Air. Here are the quick pros and cons:
Pros:
-LOUD and really do give an expansive sound stage. -Wonderful bass
-App for updates and EQ Changes
-USB-C & Wireless Charging Case
-R&L are always in sync when they should be. -Better than AirPods (not AirPods Pro)
-Phone calls have been good - my test is walking through my windy and noisy neighborhood in Brooklyn - it really reduces background noise and people don't hear the wind. Cons:
-At $150 they are overpriced. -There is a constant white noise hiss - when music is playing - you won't notice it - but during calls, podcasts, and the likes - you will definitely notice it. (more below)
-Battery life is much shorter than advertised on the case and on the earbuds. At 50% volume - I was unable to find a reviewer to get more than 6 hours of battery life on the buds and 3 recharges - for 24 total hours. -While calls have been good - at $150 - they should be much better. People hear me and understand me - but it doesn't sound like me in certain conditions. In addition - it seems like one of the bud mics is stronger than the other. Calls are only really great when I use both buds. More on the hiss: Search for Liberty Pro 2 hiss - you will find that this issue is widespread and effecting multiple anker products. There is a revision of the Liberty Pro 2 out there that reduces but does not eliminate the hiss - but also makes the headphones quieter overall - yes you lose volume. (this has been verified by many). Apparently none of those grammy winners produced audiobooks or podcasts."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-27,The best buds ever.,It’s great buds the only thing I miss the noise cancellation and it will be the best buds. But I still loves it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-27,Much better than expected,Believe the hype about the sound quality and better than expected call quality. Better than AirPod Pros!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-27,Excellent. Bought 3 pairs for gifts.,"Christmas gifts for 3 members of the family. They all love them. Great sound, battery life and noise cancellation. The mic is crystal clear on calls. They were about 30% less if I recall, prechristmas so look for a sale."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-27,Great quality earbuds. Buy it you won't regret.,"Initial Impression: Wide soundstage, comfortable and good music quality once you select the right preset from the app. The bass is very good as well. It sounds more like a over the ear headphone. Best wireless earbuds I have owned. I am yet to hear any hissing sound as others have mentioned."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-28,Superb Sound Quality,I owned the previous versions of ear buds with a wire connecting both ears. I went with these Anker brand buds because of the last version I used and they did not disappoint. I do a lot of streaming movies and videos on my iPhone. These little buds make all the digital movies I watch sound extremely fantastic. Highly recommend these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-28,Headset quality,It doesn’t perform as a headset as well as I expected. Picks up a lot of background noise. Great for music and working out!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-28,Best headphones you can buy under 150 hands down!,"These are the best ear headphones I've ever owned. Takes a little experimenting to find the right size for the ear. Other than that The attention to detail they put into the sound quality is phenomenal. When ever I want to get the most out of a song I put these in my ears. You can walk pretty far away from your connected device without and problem. Im constantly making and answering calls througout my workday and have great, clear, convenient conversations on the phone with them. These are by far the best headphones you can get under 150."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-28,Clarity,Sweet sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-01-28,"So close, yet so far away.","I wanted to love these sooo bad but in the end, I just couldn't. The lows on these are incredible. Second to none really. Super responsive and accurate bass. Mids were pretty great too. Connection for the most part is pretty straightforward. I like the wireless charging and the battery lasts forever. What it came down to for me was the highs. The sibilance and white noise was unbearable, especially at high volume. I ended up turning 8khz down almost all the way to try and mitigate it. It helped a bit but not enough for me too keep them. As always Anker was great with their customer service but in the end I had to return them. I would have loved to have kept them in the hope that a firmware update could have fixed it but didn't get any real info on that. If they can fix the highs, I'll buy them in a heartbeat. Beyond that, I'm back the their Neos wishing they were the Liberty Pro 2s."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-29,Call their customer service before you buy or try.,"I tried four finally return the last one that lasted the longest. Really wanted them to work sound the app the q and the headphone settings were a real plus the mic was a problem people thought I was far away off and on in the left earpiece went out on the last one and I had same problems on one of the others hopefully they'll get it call corrected but they only
pair with one other unit
they do have great customer service I just don't understand why they don't work it's a great idea especially if they would pair to two units at one time sounds traffic they are comfortable
lights on the buds are a little too flashlight they should just be minimal."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-29,Best on the market,Excellent earbuds with fantastic sound. No earphones or earbuds ever stay in my ears - these do.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-29,Great value for the price,"Can't believe that these buds are almost as good as my more expensive wired earbuds that I usually use on a plane and are a much better sound quality than my Bose Soundsports were. The HearID worked very well with me. Give it a try and place yourself in a room that is the quietest you can find and really concentrate on the tones. It took me about a day to get the right fit. You know you have it when you can turn the buds counterclockwise so that the long sides of the buds are parallel to the floor, basically, locking the tips into your ear canal. The crispness of sound in all frequencies is perfect with all types of music I have listened to - from EDM to classical. The spatial sound sounds natural and not contrived. I am a bit of a sound fanatic - Naim Audio sound system, Allen and Heath mixer, Alesis recorder, etc. Back to the airplane - while these guys did not cancel out noise completely, they did such a good job on my last flight that I didn't even bother plugging in my wired buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-29,Used every day for nearly two months,"Sound quality is fantastic. Battery life is absolutely stellar. There can be some discomfort for long wear, but can be fixed with adjusting with the plethora of tips, or rotating the ear bud. The sound isolation is fantastic, I cannot hear my roommate talking to me across the room. However, there are times I wish there was a passive mode that allowed me to hear. The buttons aren't amazingly convenient, I wish it had touch considering how large the earbuds are."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,0,2020-01-29,CAUTION: DOES NOT FIT IN ALL EARS,"BEWARE DOES NOT FIT IN ALL TYPES OF EARS. I tried all of the tips and instructions about how to put these on, yet they fell out repeatedly due to the poor design and uneven weight distribution. Nevertheless, I trusted Anker as a loyal customer and wore them regardless. One of the earbuds spontaneously fell out the other day with no agitation, and I lost it. Contacted the Anker support team asking to replace the single earbud. The customer representative said their warranty didn’t cover design flaws and condescendingly told me that I should have learned how to put them on properly. No replacement of the earbuds was even available even for purchase. A full $150 — literally down the drain. Don’t buy the expensive headphones, they are not worth the risk. Terribly disappointed at the product but even more so the company."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-29,I wanted to love these so much...,"Sound is absolutely amazing. Sparkly highs mixed with intense thumping bass. After awhile I was addicted to sessions. Also loved the button controls that include volume (much better than fiddly touch controls). Great app with custom eq, nice quality feel to everthing, and great battery life. But then they became so uncomfortable on my ears. I tried every combination of ear tips and wings. On the most comfortable set, I could only last about 30 min before I wanted to take them out. After that I didn’t want to put them back in because my ears hurt. I also started to notice a ringing in my ears after sessions that was alarming. I tried listening at low volumes, and turning down the treble on the EQ. Still I had that ringing in my ears after. Not so with other headphones. I don’t know if it’s because of that low-level hiss others describe or the knowles driver being super intense. I finally decided to send them back. Given the incredible sound, so bummed they didn’t work out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-30,Just the best.,"I love these plugs. I have searched many others. For a hundred bucks, these hit every box. Great sound, water proof, wireless charging, long batteries, comfortable,c type plug. Must try be happy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-30,Great sound,Good as advertised
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-30,Decent wireless headphone for most people. But may not for the audiophiles,"Just for the reference, I am a Sennheiser user. I own all of their top end in earbuds, on the ears, and over the ears headphone. So I am the type who prefers the type of headphones that clearly produce the native sound from the source. To me, Anker Soundcore Liverty 2 Pro produces clear High (even a little too much treble to my ear) and a perfect amount of low for the size (just right amount of warm base), but unfortunately the middle is clearly missing. If you are an audiophile, it will be obvious to you. However, since this phone can be tuned to your unique hearing profile (first of its kind, that's why I'm trying it), I found it actually do compensate some of its lacking of middle to the point most people might not even realize the missing middle frequency. So yes, setup and turn on your hearing profile. Who is ASL2 Pro for? Most people will find it of a very decent wireless headphone in its price range. Beautifully designed and quality built, very portable, and it is comfortable to wear (make sure to find yourself with the proper fitting, cause it also effect your sound quality). For audiophiles, you may be bothered by the hissing at the high and the lacking of the middle, despite the overall sound quality can be tuned to quite decent level due to its unique software and hardware capability. Yes, the ambien noise when no music is playing. I have no problem commute with it. Hopefully Anker will update its firmware to dampen some of the hissing at the high. No sure about the lack of the middle if there is no driver to physically produce it. But maybe they can digitally compensate somewhat. Yes, I would recommend it for most people at around $100 price range."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-30,My review,This product has impressive sound with innovative technology backing that sound. The high to the low tone all run harmoniously. No latency. I own several bluetooth headsets including jbl endurance peak and samsung buds. These have become my favorite. Problems I have had is the buds fitment being a little strange. Falls out. Other devices seem to interfere with playback. Causing deadspots in the song or complete loss of connection. Not sure if it is other bluetooth devices or other frequencies.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-30,Amazing sound for the price!,These sounds amazing and the battery life is awesome!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-31,Great sound quality,Great pair of ear buds! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-01-31,Great quality headphones with an amazing battery.,"I've had these for about 2 weeks now and absolutely love them. The sound quality is great, an upgrade from the zolo liberty+ I used to have. I upgraded to the Soundcores after accidentally leaving my zolos in an airport in Thailand. I use these headphones on my daily commute while walking to work. They block out most of the sound, which is great, however I wish there was a ""transparency mode"" like the predecessor model's did. Call quality is pretty good, I like how the call comes through both ear buds. The battery life is absolutely amazing. I use it for 1.5 hours a day, and only had to charge it once upon opening them. Great buy! Great company and customer service."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-31,"Hissing noise, disappointing","First off, I love Anker and swear by their products. These were intended to replace my SoundBuds Slim, which have been my standby for nearly 2 years. I was looking for a more premium option with these, and was disappointed to experience white noise hissing coming through every time I played music or got on a phone call. Sound quality was good, but not touching the quality of a wired IEM. The build quality was okay, plastic everywhere, but I guess I expected a more premium feel for this price range. Honestly I would be okay with these issues if not for that obnoxious hiss. Dealbreaker for me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-01-31,I really want to LOVE these...but...,"I'll preface this by saying that with music these sound amazing, especially with the app. The ability to customize multiple EQ's really allows you to fine tune your preference for various genres. This is great, but my primary use for these is more dialogue drive. Movies, TV, Youtube, etc. I watch a lot of content on my iPad. Coming from Airpods, these are far superior in sound quality. Volume can even be higher if you raise the necessary frequencies in the app's EQ settings. However, I find that for my ears these are natively too bright. On a flat EQ (which is what is apparently recommended by the HearID feature of the app), the ""S"" frequency range is far too bright, but no big deal, I can adjust the EQ to fit my liking, and compared to the Airpods, there is simply more detail (thanks to the dual drivers). So why can't I LOVE these? Well, I really, REALLY want to...but there is this very annoying, almost irritating background noise that is intermittent. No it doesn't persist all the time. It's a very low hiss (probably in the 3Khz to 7Khz range) that comes on when I switch apps, or start and stop a video (in some apps, not all). If it was there all the time I would likely get used to it and accept it as part of the sound. It doesn't happen in the Music app, or the Soundcore app, or even the Disney+ app. But it does happen in the YouTube app, Safari, and probably more that I haven't tested. And yes, this is when no media is playing. And yes, I've updated to the latest firmware. And yes, I can tell as media starts to play that the noise doesn't disappear, it just gets masked by the audio being played overtop of it. To me, the fact that the hiss CAN go away, and doesn't persist constantly indicates to me that it shouldn't ever have to be there. I've heard about this being an issue in a previous iteration of this model, but that a new version has come out that does not have this hiss. People complained that on the previous version the hiss was unbearable, but I cannot say this is unbearable. Maybe unacceptable for this price point, but seeing as I can't find any documentation that would allow me to figure out if I was shipped the new version, or the previous one, I cannot know for sure. As for comfort, they are not too bad. Not as comfortable as Airpods or Airpods Pro, but they felt secure. I did have an issue after just a few days where the inside of one of my ears became irritated to the point of pain at the contact point of the stem. If all I had to deal with was slightly less than perfect comfort this wouldn’t bother me, but with the hiss this just adds to the distraction. With earbuds you shouldn’t have to think about them when they are in your ears. There’s too much about these that distract me from what I’m using them for. In the end, I decided to return these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-01-31,Hiss hiss and more hiss,All I hear is a background hiss if the music isn't SUPER loud. Very Disappointed in what I was expecting to be an excellent product. I've contacted Soundcore to see if there is anything they can do to help with the problem.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,Awesome,If your playing on getting a pair of earbuds this is the set for you especially if your a bass head there blow everything out of the water and they get super loud in also have the Sony’s m3 these 100 times better then the Sony’s make sure you used the app for these it does make a difference
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,Wow,Best ear phones I have ever owned.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,Best sounding wireless earbuds at this price point,If sound quality is your main focus at this price range the Liberty 2 can’t be beat. They will stick out some due to the shape and don’t have the best isolation but the sound makes up for that in my opinion.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,Worth the full price. Their great!,Best Bluetooth earbuds I have ever owned. Once these are burned out I will buy them or an updated model. I can't believe how long they last. My whole workday of 10 hours with these in and the battery is still going and they don't hurt my ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-01,Good sound quality but horrible voice call quality,"I used it for over couple of months. The music quality is good considering the price point. It's better than Samsung buds and it offers decent bass and excellent mids and high but the voice call quality is utter rubbish. Also, everyone complaining about the white noise is correct. There is a constant hissing noise when the volume is low. Overall a decent earphone but horrible voice call quality. Updated to 4 star : Anker customer care reached out and sent me a soundcore neo. The neo is great for voice calls, overall I'm very happy with the customer service experience."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,Great earbuds.,One tiny suggestion. When using the custom sound based on age. Add an extra modifier for bass and treble. In case bass or treble is too high.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-01,"A little bulky, but fantastic sound","Best set of earbuds I've ever owned. Punchy bass, clear highs, and a great equalizer in the app.
The only downside to them is the size, they're a little bulky, and I had trouble keeping them in my ears; but once I hit some foam ear tips for them, that wasn't an issue. Plus the only reason they're heavy is because of the 9 hour battery, which I think is a fair trade."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,"Small and wireless, big sound!","The sound and comfort are amazing! Love the app as well to customize your sound. You can't go wrong with these. I tried many different buds and these were comparable with most over ear headphones, that is how good the sound is."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,Great noise canceling,My husband was so impressed! He works for ups. When I would call him before I could never hear him because of the noise. With these I can hear him so clearly. It really does cancel the noise.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-01,These are the best I've tried.,"Best fit out of many that I've tried. Sound is fantastic, clear, bass is nice. Battery is less than advertise by an hour or two. Over all I love them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-02,At this point i don't know if is anker or the seller's whos to blame for the faulty earbuds.,"First pair had a wierd sound out of the left bud and the sound would come and go.But what was wierd was that it happened only on calls, the sound of the music was awesome. So i got another pair by next day and it was the same problem, plus the first pair looked like it was used as compared to the second one."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-02,"Great sound, Great app!","Absolutely love these. Great sound, great app that provides a unique equalizer to tune these to the sound you like."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-02,Top notch,Great ear buds great sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-02,Another good one by Anker! Pros and cons,"I am really big on audio quality. I have a pair of audio Technica M50x which sound amazing but over ear headphones are a little impractical in some circumstances. I have tried the beats wireless earphones and to be honest they don't seem like you're getting the best bang for your buck. I think their overpriced. I have the Anker soundcore pro Bluetooth speaker, which I love and use all the time, so I decided to do some research about Anker headphones. After doing research and reading reviews and based on my good experience with Anker products, I decided to go with the liberty 2 pro. Here's my pros and cons:
Pros:
-battery life wasn't quite up to advertising but still nothing to complain about you're still able to get a few days depending on how many hours a day you use. -the case is small, supports wireless charging and feel sturdy. -the headphones themselves sound amazing they don't really stick out of the ear if put in properly, and fit nice and snug in ear. I've never had them fall out. They paid to my phone very easily. -soundcore app has a lot of presets for equalizer, and you can update firmware, map touch commands, etc, directly from the app
Cons:
-they can be a little uncomfortable after a while of use but it's not really noticeable until you take them out. I know everyone is different but that's just for me. -this one isn't really a bad thing but out of the box the bass range drowns out the high range a little but that's nothing a little mixing on the EQ can't fix. -I'd rather touch controls instead of buttons but really that's just a personal preference thing, the buttons are still very easy to use
Point is do you research and don't pay for overpriced things such as brand name and pointless feature that you won't use."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-02,Whoa...🤯,"Even after reading/watching all the reviews I was not prepared...🤯 Don't hesitate, these things are perfect... A ton of included tips means you're sure to find your ears' perfect fit and they stay in nice and snug. Once you go through the hearing test (you read that right. The app tests your hearing sensitivity over a range of frequencies to dial in the EQ perfectly for each individual ear...) the sounds quality is nothing short of astounding! Controls are simple and intuitive, works a treat with Google Assistant, and single ear mode is perfect for work with the added bonus of never having to worry about charge levels with the charging case and wireless charging. Have yet to use it to make calls but I know the sound quality will be great and I'm sure, with how clearly the Google Assistant was able to hear me, the other caller will hear me nice and clearly. In summation, these things are freaking amazing! Update: sound quality on calls is fantastic! Caller sounds like they're right there next to you and caller on the other end heard zero wind noise even though it was blowing about 20-30mph!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-02,Amazing headphones,These are amazing headphones. So much better than any other expensive headphones I have had. Make sure to try HearID ...it made a huge difference.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-02,Finally Bluetooth Handles Lossless Audio,Finally tech has caught up with audio capabilities. The Bluetooth does NOT drop. Steady signal with outstanding audio...especially even with uncompressed audio files.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-02,Excellent sound. Comfortable.,Excellent sound. Comfortable. Would buy again.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-02-02,It sucks,This head just stop connecting ( left ear) I have done everything and it won't connect.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-03,No noise pass through,this is a great earbuds. It's just missing noise pass through so having a conversation with someone next to you is hard with them on your ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,Worth it,Very comfortable and very clear crisp sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,"They are just, OK.","I don’t think this product has a very good volume output, otherwise I’m happy with them. I’m very savvy with these types of earbuds,, but I have to say, they didn’t meet my expectations."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,"Great Sound, Excellent battery life","I first bought the Liberty 2 ear buds. When I got on their Site-while setting these up, I discovered the Liberty 2 Pro was on sale from the factory. I used the originals for a couple of days and then sent them back and got the Pro. I will say I don't think either one will disappoint you. Both sound really, really good. The sound Pro is a bit better balanced, with less Bass (the bass is also tighter). The sound stage is a bit better and the mids and highs are crisper. My source is an I Phone 8 Plus. It pairs easily with the buds. The buds come with several different sized silicone tips and three different sized rings. They fit my ears really well and are comfortable. I use these at the gym. One thing, the IPX rating for the pro is 4, while 5 for the non-pro. I don't know that this is any issue for anyone since several high-end ear buds claim water and sweat resistance with a rating of 4. They appear well made and the charger/case is fairly small and also looks well made. I hope this review helps in your search for wireless ear buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,High Quality,These are some of the best sounding wireless headphones I have ever used. Even with the app and setting the custom eq is amazing. The only thing that I am missing is a moldable over the ear wire to hold them on instead of the rubber piece that puts pressure on the side of my ear. If I have them in to long my ear starts to get soar. But other than that I would highly recommend these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,Great Earbuds with Powerful Base,"Some minor hissing without audio playing, but people make it out to be a lot louder than it actually is. Great earbuds!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-03,"Good sound, not very comfortable for me","I loved the sound this produced. It made the music sound very clear and more lively. I unfortunately had many problems with them. First was even getting them to fit in my ear at all. A grain of salt tho, most ear buds for me, do not fit in my ears comfortably. I have had alot of trouble with getting these to either ""twist and lock"" in my ear, keeping them from slipping out, or keeping the sound from outside out. The ear wings either were way too small for my ears or were stabbing into my ear. There was no real in between for the sizing. The ear tips were either rubbing the inside of my ear raw or were just slipping themselves out of my ear and not keeping any sound out at all.. In the end, I was tired of forcing these to stay put in my ears for the full 40 hour work week. (I did use these every single day. I really wanted these to work.) I did keep these for 3 weeks before I felt the inside of my ears getting more and more sensitive and painful..
Second up was on the ""Hip Hop"" setting on the app I could hear the hissing sound that others were speaking of. I did update these ear buds through the app asap. On the recommend setting in the app I did not hear the hissing sound. I did try all of the settings in the app. I didn't hear the noise for the other ones as well. This was kinda unfortunate, because the Hip Hop setting for the music I was listening to made the songs sound so good. There was songs I loved and listened to all the time and these made them sound even better. I think that was the reason why I didn't want to return these as late as I did. Third the Noise Cancelling was not present in the slightest. No matter how many times I did the ""twist and turn"" they showed in their info books they would not stay in my ear and did not keep any sound out. I did use these at home and work and was able to hear my TV, people who would walk past, and the forklifts that were being used at work. I could even hear people whispering and my music would be loud as hell. So that and the fit were the major issues that I had with these. These ear buds didn't really like me too much. I unfortunately kinda liked these. If my ears didn't hate the ear tips and wings, I would of kept these and still would be using these. The sound quality was great. Me personally I didn't even care about the hissing sound from the hip hop setting. It made the music sound fantastic. I loved it very much. Unfortunately the overall experience of these....I couldn't keep these at the price I bought them and not be comfortable with them at any point in time. So if you're looking for some good quality ear buds and can actually wear buds comfortably, these are a good competitor to the others. If you can't like me, I'd say stick to headphones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,Awesome earphones,"These sound as good or better than my Master and Dynamic mw07’s but get significantly louder. As with any in ear headphone just make sure you have the proper size tips. Also, use the Soundcore app to get the sound signature you like."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,Finally long battery life,Best ear buds I ever got
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,Missing accessories,These are a great pair of wireless eat buds but for some reason mine came with no accessories inside the box.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-03,My new favorite for when I don't want wires in the way,"Pros:
*Great sound quality (for a bluetooth device anyway)
*Great sound isolation
*Tons of fitment options with the many included tips and earrings
*long battery life and several charges in the carry case battery
*nice lows, mids and highs with a good rolloff so highs are never harsh in my ear
Cons:
My wife couldn't get any of the tips to seal in her ear, so they won't work for everyone, but they seal in my ear great, and they sound fantastic when sealed properly in the ears"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-03,Otherworldly,"This wireless bud is the best... every quality top notch... battery life... otherworldly, sound quality- epoch!!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-03,sound or fit,"They sound really good but do not stay in the ear. Silicon tips are useless they do not hold them. I was about to return them but I find memory foam tips and is much better, but still i do not think they are for running rather for sturdy workout. Over all good build quality and sound but not perfect fit."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-04,Great sound — great bass!,Great sound — great bass!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-04,So Far,These are my 2nd set of wireless ear buds. They are definitely better than my first much cheaper ones. I use them at work and the gym. They stay in pretty well and are fairly comfortable.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-04,Great quality and tunability,First pair of earphones of this brand. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and performance. The sound tunning is great but wish it would drown out more of the outside sound.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-04,Absolutely love my Liberty 2 Pro's,I bought these after my knockoff Airpods died after less than a month of use and wanted to try a higher quality product. Obviously get what you pay for. I mostly use these when I am weight lifting at the gym. They drown out all noise around me and even though they are on the larger side I forget I have them in. The physical buttons for skipping tracks and pausing took about a day to get used to but now I don't even think about it when I use them. Only things I would change on them is the ability to map 3 or even 4 presses to possibly increase or decrease volume or other functions. Along with the ability to connect them to multiple devices. It can be a pain to connect to my phone to watch videos and then connect again to my Apple Watch when I am in the gym. I would buy these again. If you can find them on sale it is even better. Plus the white ones they just released really look cool too.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-04,The perfect wireless headphones,These headphones are perfect in every way possible.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-04,Liberty pro2 rocks,Clear and crisp sound
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-05,"If sound quality is your top earphone priority, buy these now. Seriously. Buy them.","I have had and have numerous pairs of true wireless earphones. If you care about sound quality above all else, buy these. I have owned true wireless earphones from Bragi, Klipsch, 1More, Cambridge Soundworks, Sennheiser, Sasmung and Sony (the Wf-1000xm3s). And my wife owns Airpod Pros, which I have listened to often to compare with others. While these do not have ANC, the passive cancellation with a good seal is more than good enough. They stay fit in your ear even during exercise. They support aptx. Most important, regardless of price, they sou d better than anything else currently out there. The Sonys come closest, but the Liberty Pro 2 is decidedly better in soundstaging, clarity, punch and tightness of bass and musicality. And they are $150 retail (I got them here on Amazon before Christmas for $110). They are a steal: $100 less than Airpod Pros, $80 less than the Sonys, $65 less than the Sennheisers. Bonus: the physical buttons you push to operate them, about which I was skeptical, make them so much easier to use than any of the tough control earphones with swipes and taps. Outside in winter, you don't have to remove gloves to operate them."

However...these are the BEST SET EVER!!! Great bass and treble balance and the my ears do not hurt after two songs. The only thing I would like to see as an improvement would be for them to be able to connect to two devices. I use an mp3 for my audio and that means I have to ""watch"" my phone for calls. They are the first pair I reach for now."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-05,Maybe I received a lemon,"Out of all electronic brands, Anker is among the most reliable. I own over 15 Anker products and is always my first choice especially when dealing with accessories for our $1000 phones. After reading and watching reviews, I was disappointed in the clarity of the mid and high frequency sounds. Bass was very clean and powerful, but the mids and highs sounded staticky. It sounded bad. It had to be a lemon if it was endorsed by musicians, right?"

I have a ""normal"" headset. However. I would like to leave my congratulations to the Anker support team who after I wrote my opinion about the product and knowing that the headphones did not work properly. Take a note with me note 1000. I could not solve my problem 100% but we had a conversation to alleviate the problem. I thank you for your attention with me. Anker support 5 stars!"

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-06,Awesome sound!,"The sound quality of these wireless buds is exceptional and the battery life is a huge bonus. Overall, it’s just good."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-06,A most excellent set of earbuds for listening to music.,I use these earbuds when I workout at the gym and go for walks. I have not experienced the “hiss” that some users have complained about. The Soundcore app. now has a full equalizer which I use when listening to music. Wireless charging works well and Bluetooth connectivity was quick and easy. I use these everyday and enjoy them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-07,Very good alternative to more expensive products,The only negative is that there is a very low hissing noise when no sound is being played. Great packaging. Nice case. I also like the availability of functions given by the use of the buttons on the earbuds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-07,They’re great,I love these ear buds
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-08,Convinced me to go wireless,"I was skeptical of these at first. They do seem expensive given how loud they get--a cheaper pair of wired 'phones will compete with them on sheer volume. With that said the sound quality is good and they deliver good bass. I do feel that they lose a little bass response when battery levels decline. The battery itself lasts a long time and the case isn't as annoying to carry around has I had thought when I have a backpack. I can go for a week on a single charge of the case. Also, they're amazing for phone calls and the gym where the lack of a cord is really convenient, just make sure you size them right for your ear so they don't fall out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-08,Phenomenal Value and Quality.,"I did about two months of research from YouTube to articles on reddit to you name it. And everything I found pointing to sound quality, battery life, ease of use, for the price showed that liberty pro 2 were the absolute best option for me. No they don’t have active noise cancelling but the seal they create with their ear tips do a dang good job of passive noise cancellation. My wife will be trying to get my attention while I clean the kitchen or am picking up around the house and I am completely unaware of her because it blocks sound out so well. The sound is wide, punchy and boomy and there’s eq settings that’s are easy to use and help you find your sound. I’ve used these every day for two weeks and have only had to charge the case once the entire time. To charge I just sat the case on the wireless charging pad and a few hours later I had weeks worth of listening time. Best purchase I’ve made in awhile and these have made listening to music fun for me, has made phone calls easy for me. Can’t recommend them enough."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-08,Great buy,Great
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-08,"Amazing sound, fit, and quality","After trying many different pairs, I finally bought these and I am completely happy with the purchase. I did not want to go with AirPods or the AirPods Pro just because of the cost. I got these on sale but they are worth the full price. They fit great and stay in without any worry of them falling out. The battery life is amazing and even better is that you can use one at a time, essentially doubling your battery life if you just switch from one side to the other. With both in, the passive sound isolation is really good and I feel like even if these had active noise cancelation, it wouldn’t be a huge improvement. The sound is nothing short of amazing and just need to be heard. The case is solid and holds a lot of charge for the earbuds. I love the usb-c rather than the older micro-usb. Do yourself a favor and give them a try. The one thing I wish they had was a pass-through mode or a feature where you could choose to have a certain percentage of the surrounding noise be mixed with what you hear. It’d be nice to hear your surroundings like that-if you wanted. I suppose it’d also be nice If they had touch controls instead or physical buttons (the buttons though are perfectly placed and have a nice click feel). However, I have never used earbuds with touch controls that worked well so I don’t feel like it’s a big miss."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-08,Would not fit my ear shape,"These buds would not fit me regardless of what I did. However, ifni held them in, the sound was pure Bliss. Call me snob, but I am immensely picky when it comes to sound quality and these not only met but exceeded my expectations."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-08,"Impressive sound, great quality!","The ads for these feature various experts on sound reproduction, which made me a bit wary... but, they were right! Incredible sound, integrate well with my iPhone. A little iffy on phone calls outdoors in the wind, but other than that, top notch!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-08,Absolutely wonderful product,"I gave these to my wife for Christmas and she loves them. They are comfortable,sound great and the battery life is exceptionally good. I would without a doubt recommend to anyone and buy again."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-08,Amazing audio for your money!,"As far as sound quality goes these are amazing for the cost! Very well layed out sound stage presence while maintaining great high/mid/low separation and clarity. With the huge array of included tips/wings fit should not be a problem with a little experimenting. The only place these seem to fall short is in the mic department, everyone says I sound tingy and distant. Battery life lasts all day and recharge is incredibly fast. If you are looking for a great audio experience at a mid range price, look no further."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-09,Terrible hiss sound on these and the replacement pair,"There is a WELL KNOWN and documented problem with there ear buds. I got mine and there was a constant hiss sound. Soundcore was EXTREMELY difficult to deal with after they had my money. I fought and fought with then to get a fixed product. They offered to let me keep the extra pair if I would give them the chance to send me the fixed set. Before I agreed to accept them, I addressed the issue of getting a bad second set, and what to do. They said they would have me keep the newest pair and return the oldest. I was worried I might get another set that had the same problem, and didn't want to end up in an akward situation. Because they seemed like that would be fine to do, I agreed. I got the second set, and they had the same issue. I contacted soundcore and the language barrier became a problem. After returning the original to Amazon, they got back to me. They said I was send a second pair from the bad batch, but they would absolutely not deal with me anymore since I returned the original set. I understand that. But then they began sending me emails demanding the second pair be returned at my expense! Not happening. So after some back and forth, management got involved, agreed that I could keep the second set, or return them for a discount on a new pair. I am done with soundcore. They were rude, and couldn't communicate clear enough. I will say that I've bought several sets of their earbuds before this, and they have all been a great value. The specs on these sound great, but that hiss is too much to take, ESPECIALLY at that kind of money!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-09,Better than others I have,Was skeptic about purchasing these buds since I always stuck to the more common brands. Was glad I decided to give these a go and must say as a all around ear bud these things are awesome. From the eq settings to the wireless charging these things are great. The sound quality is amazing as well.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-09,Great buy/great choice,The sound quality is amazing on these ear bud. I highly recommend these over any other wireless ear bud. I feel like these are on par with the sennhiser momentum’s is not better.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-09,These Bang,You want the overhead headset experience then you get these. Battery life was awesome. Charged the case every other week. They are bulky but still light. Never had the hissing sound people talked about in some reviews. They have a passive noise cancelation. Never fell out my ear. Customer service was pretty awesome too.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-09,great ear buds,love these ear buds. only nit is that sometimes only one side will connect via bluetooth. may have to manually connect or open the soundcore app.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-02-10,Too high of a noise floor.,"First off let me say these defiant have a better dynamic range than the AirPods Pro. They have too much background noise though and its distracting from what you are playing especially if its spoken word, or there is silence or quiet section of the music. Also they are uncomfortable for periods longer than an hour. Honestly their low-end Liberty Neo are more comfortable and they done have the same noise issue only problem is they don't have USB-C. I am hoping when the Spirit Dot 2 come out they will be a good happy medium. But these are defiantly going back."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-10,WOW.,A completely new experience! So happy I refer everyone!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-10,Water resistant!!,Loved them
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-10,great sounds awesome bass definitely recommend,so wanted to leave an update about these headphone contact the company and I will never buy from another company regarding any kind of air buds the response time from the people at anker was unreal literally a few hours later I was mailed the proper tips to prevent slippage during my intense workouts not only do I recommend these air buds but recommed buying any products from this company cause not only dont they listen the response time is perfect
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-11,Not that ideal for me,It was not perfect on connection with iOS devices especially when you need to switch to multiple devices
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-11,Best price/quality,"I love them, was a better choice than buying other wireless headphones that I was looking into price/quality I couldn’t have made a better choice"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-12,Great sound quality and great fit.,These earbuds are excellent. Didn’t know what to expect. I had Apple IPods and was very dissatisfied with fit and sound. The Liberty 2 Pros fit great and the sound is terrific. I love the fact that you can customize the sound through the app. Well worth the price and I’d highly recommend them for audiophiles.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-02-12,First impression is bad,"First soundcore product. Your first impression is bad. My left earbuds didn’t connect with my device. It was glowing in purple colour
Tried resetting it. Still no use. Can’t update since it requires both earbuds to be active"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-12,"First defective, second amazing. Great customer service.","My first order had the ""hissing"" issue when a bluetooth connection became active. This seems to be common for the early runs based on a Google search. It was not a problem for music, but it was for audiobooks. I contacted Anker for an RMA and they sent me a set with the hissing issue fixed. These things sound amazing and have fantastic battery life. The second pair is the best set of wireless earbuds I have ever owned, by a very wide margin. I'd have knocked off a star due to the first pair's defect if it was not for Anker's amazing customer service. They were patient and accommodating almost to a fault. Seriously, I can't believe the extent to which they worked to ensure that I got a new pair with no inconvenience to me. I can't recommend this company enough."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-12,Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 are great.,Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 are great.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-12,Amazing sound dont hesitate!,"Amazing product! The best sound off all 3 that I have tested including the Jabra elite 75t , the edifier, and the soundcore liberty 2 air. Look no further if you value sound above all else! Btw the hissing that everyone on youtube is complaining about is non existent on my pair I dont think it is an issue anymore with the most recent update. Go for it if you have been debating these because of the hissing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-02-12,"Excellent headphones; Great sound, calling, etc. But: Terrible case design!","These ear buds are great. I have not had any of the issues that people have reported (hissing, pairing issues, etc.) For just straight up music, they sound great and the equalizer in the app is very useful. Microphone/phone call quality is excellent. They have ridiculous range and pair up easily/quickly every time. You can pair each one to a separate devices however, this can be somewhat difficult given how fast they are able to pair together and the range (distance apart) they can pair. I pair the left with my work computer and leave it on the desk. Then I walk about 50 yards or more away and pair the right with my phone (turn on Mono sound in accessibility settings). The charge time is great. I've used them for multiple days without charging in the case and the case charge doesn't seem to fade. My only issue is the design of the case. It's absolutely maddening. When you take the earbuds out of your ear, you are not holding them in a position that you can just place them in the case; you have to rearrange the way you're holding them in order to put them in. It sounds like its not a big deal but It's like you're holding the last piece of a puzzle that doesn't seem to want to fit in its place no matter which way you flip it; every time!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-12,Sounds like Mediocre Home Theatre,"They sound good, not great. Sound is like mediocre home theatre quality. Fit is good."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-12,Really crackly mids - dealbreaker on an otherwise nice product,"I'm not sure if I managed to get a bum pair, but the mids (i.e. vocals) were super crackly, which for the price is just unacceptable. I also found the fit less than ideal, though that is 100% a case-by-case individual issue. I have some cheaper wireless earbuds from Anker (different sub-brand; zolo rather than soundcore) which to me sound much better, so I know that they can and do make better-sounding drivers, but I have some other issues with the UX that has me looking for alternatives. The UX on these is nice; there's a small button on the top edge of each driver that's easy to get to and not overly clicky (one of my main complaints on the zolo), and the actions are adjustable with the app.
I also really appreciate the ability to wear either one of the earbuds individually. I may give these another shot, hoping the pair I got was just a dud."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-13,Wont be mad you bought,Love these .. may cause ear fatigue over long periods of use but these are great quality
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-02-13,"Earbuds fall out of ears, dropped into ocean","Earbuds fall out of ears, dropped into ocean"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-13,Initial poor product experience but these turned out to be great sounding,"First to mention, I received an empty package when I first ordered these earbuds. I should have taken that as a bad omen. But I’m reviewing the product and not Amazon’s shipping and handling. Which to say, they were very good about refunding my money. After receiving the second set of earbuds, I followed the instructions to pair them and the sound was very nice. But that’s where all the features of these ended. After installing and configuring the Soundcore app I tried upgrading the firmware. They would not upgrade no matter what I tried; different devices, multiple resets, app re-installs and pairings. Nothing worked/works. The version for each earbud remains L Version: 01.09; R Version: 01.22. The Soundcore app is now useless as it’s stuck trying to upgrade the firmware it can’t. The equalizer and other features in the app are inaccessible. The earbud features the firmware was supposed to provide are null. This renders the majority of the product useless. An Internet search turned up other customers with this issue but no resolution. I contacted Anker/Soundcore support and still waiting. I am glad I didn’t buy these to give as a gift. Currently researching other brands. Update 2/16/2020:
After some looking around I decided to pick up the Bose Soundsport Free earbuds. Paired them with my cell and updated the firmware with no issues. Currently enjoying the Bose earbuds. I want to say the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro earbuds sounded better (from what I can remember) but I can’t currently compare them as I sent them RMA’d to Anker support. Now I’ll probably get a re-furbished pair for the cost I paid for new earbuds. Update 2/25/2020:
After receiving a replacement for the earbuds I was able to upgrade the firmware with no issues. The replacement pair came with firmware version 01.16 and easily upgrade to version 01.22. The earbuds sound amazing. Better than the Bose. And battery life is great. Once getting over the initial issue I find these earbuds to be a great product and as advertised by Anker. Anker support was great and very attentive. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of bluetooth earbuds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-13,Not what i expected,Horrible could not keep a connection kept cutting out in the gym maybe they are food for home use only i was using an android phone the app was ok the buttons to adjust the volume frustrated me because it kept going to the next song.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-13,"Initially great, then hit a problem and then great again","Some context, first of all, I did a lot of research before I bought these wireless earbuds and bought several other brands before deciding on these as my primary pair, mainly due to all the positive reviews (Amazon & YouTube) on the audio and build quality, the tipping point was the discount coupon that brought the Amazon price down to $120. Initially, the buds were great everything the review stated, superb audio quality and clarity, great battery life, tuned to your ears (great feature), light case that is also charged by USB-C, water-resistant, sound isolation but no *Noise Reduction*. The problem started when I moved from a Note 10+ to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and tried to pair the headphones to the iPhone, it simply wouldn't pair as stereo headphones but as 2 distinct left and right. I found a forum discussion about this very problem and followed all the suggestions to no avail. I contacted the wonderful Soundcore Customer Support and within 3 days returned my old buds and had received a brand new pair shipped from Amazon. All is great again very happy with the purchase and especially with the after purchase support, I will likely buy a pair for the wife. Highly recommended. Note I reduced my rating by a point due to the problems defined in m,y review"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-13,"Update: Replaced received, works amazing.","After speaking to customer service and getting a speedy replacement, the headphones work better than I could've expected. Lin who is on the support team was really patient with me and helped me to both troubleshoot the issue and work through some bumps. Previous message:
Left-sided headphone stopped charging after a month of use."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-14,Give these a try,I'm still taking them through their paces however I must say so far so good these are incredible sounding True wireless earbuds
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-14,Incredibly fun sound.,"These earbuds sound fantastic. Very fun sound with punchy bass and bright treble. Decent soundstage and great instrument separation. The earbuds are pretty comfy despite their size and battery life is great too compared to other wireless earbuds. Only thing is the mic quality isn't that great, my friend said i sound ""Far away and a little staticy"" Still a great earbud for the money. The only thing that would make it perfect is noise cancellation and better mic quality. Maybe if Anker releases a Soundcore Liberty 3/Pro they can add that."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-14,"Amazing product, 100% worth the money","I love this product, it sounds amazing and is so compact that I can carry it around everywhere so easily. Plus, the wide assortment of buds and ear wings made it so easy to find one that made it comfortable to wear."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-14,Great True Wireless Earbuds,"Pros:
- Sound quality is fantastic. These are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds I've ever used. Vocals are clear & vibrant, bass is clean & punchy. - With the wide collection of silicon tips & wings included, I was able to find the right combination that was comfortable for my ears and they stay in securely. - Build quality of the case & buds are both great. It feels like a well-made product. - Wireless charging is great and I'm glad to see these have USB-C instead of micro/mini USB. - Built-in microphones for taking calls is always a welcome feature. I haven't heard what it sounds like myself, but nobody has complained about being able to hear me clearly on calls. That's good enough for me. Cons:
- At this price point, I'd like to see touch-control on the buds. The physical buttons are a less-than-ideal way to control audio directly from them. It's bad enough to where I simply do not use it and rely on controls on the device paired to them. Other Thoughts:
As someone who has great appreciation for audio quality, I'm quite happy with these. The overall comfort, sound quality, and build quality make these a worthy purchase. I'd just like to see touch controls & perhaps a higher water/sweat resistance rating on the next iteration of these, even if it means a nominal price increase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-14,These true Wireless Earbuds will not disappoint.,Amazing sound.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,Ok,Awesome sound... no white noise. Only issue is I can’t use the app to customize the sound ... everything else is good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-15,Price=Quality.,Better than my JBL earbuds.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,These earbuds sound amazing!,"I've been using these Liberty 2 Pro earbuds for 3 months and they are the absolute best sounding earbuds I have ever tried! They sound great, look good, and they hold a charge for way longer than I need. The fit wasn't perfect for my ears until I spent 30 minutes trying out the different rubber fitment tips. I found what worked for me and now I absolutely love these things! And the Soundcore app is also a nice touch when dialing in the sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,Concert in your ears.,These earbuds are awesome. The best ones that I have ever owned. Definitely worth the money.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,Great earphones,Great product
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,Affordable and worth it!,The BEST bluetooth ear buds I've ever owned.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-02-15,Ok for starter earbuds,Fit ok but would fall out sound quality and battery life could also be improved
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,The app is icing on the cake.,Great little size. Great battery. Great fit. They have a very helpful app to great the right sound. Worth it.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-15,Excellent Product!!!!,Very light.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-16,Amazing Sound with caveats that may or may not apply to you,"Sound wise these are truly impressive, they just about match any true wireless buds out there. The highs are clear and the base is powerful and doesn't crowd out the high's. Mids are vibrant and they achieve a good volume for something wireless. But I returned them for 2 reasons. The right ear bud was consistently using more battery than the left, some days it was twice as fast as the left! Second was the fit, but this will vary for different people. While they are very secure in your ear, the rounded hard plastic adjacent to the tip put too much pressure on the opening to my ear canal. Wearing them for more than 30 minutes would cause noticeable discomfort. Some may not have this problem as my ears are on the smaller size. If they are comfortable to you and you don't have the battery issue they are great! ++Impressive sound quality, elite really
++Powerful base that doesn't drown out higher note
+Good Volume
+Great weather resistance
+Decent BT connectivity
--Right earbud consistently used more battery than left
- I've seen others with this problem but it doesn't seem to
be universal, big deal if it can't be remedied
-- Fit, very secure but wasn't comfortable to me personally
- Your experience may vary"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-16,"Top heavy, but sound great!","They're a little on the heavy side, but they sound great!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-16,Understand.,"This is what you've been waiting for since bluetooth tws came out. So, What are you waiting for?? Buy it!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-16,Deep Bass and software EQs,"The bass is really present on this Bluetooth. I had the Monster in ear gold and that was a $400 mistake, but this one sounds really balanced with deep bass. On the plus side you can use preset EQ or customize your EQ to taste."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-16,Incredible headphones,Balanced sound great battery life have no complaints
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-16,I love it,Grate headphones
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-16,Almost perfect wireless earbuds,"The sound is great on the wireless earbuds. I just wish they had audio passthrough, multiple device connection support, and better button functionality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-16,Best among the rest n good bang 4ur Moni,Very nice product n also sounds wonderfully well.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-17,Great for listening but not speaking,"If I had these just for listening, the media sound quality is great, however, i needed the microphone capability as well and multiple people said the phone kept ""going in and out"" which made it impossible to have a conversation so this was a deal breaker for me. As an aside I also had them connected to my laptop bluetooth and when clicked the button to answer a phone call, they locked my laptop screen with a dark overlay. did not investigate as I was returning them anyway due to the microphone not working."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-02-17,Meh,"Honestly, not worth the money. When I wasn't having problems with connection issues, I was having problems with it falling out of my ear. If I wore them too long, my ears also hurt. When they did connect without my turning everything off, they were just okay sound wise. The tap and rub sound was pretty loud with these and the functions didn't turn off when you took one out. They do have a lot of accessories and the little charger case carries an amazing charge. The mic quality was also great. I am a huge fan of Anker products, but this was kind of a miss for me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-17,"They work great, no problems!","I have been using them for months, they sound amazing! They last longer than I need them too, and are really comfortable to wear."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-17,Amazing fit and quality,"I am absolutely impressed with these earbuds. When I buy audio tech, I try my hardest to get the best sounding device I can afford. These buds don't disappoint. The bass is heavy and punchy without overwhelming the very crisp mids and highs. Plenty of volume. Any louder would be dangerous. Bluetooth connection has been solid up to 25 feet but would probably go a tad further (paired with an S10+). Literally the only gripe is the white noise mentioned by a fair number of users. It can only be experienced in the first moment of unpausing a track and a brief moment after pausing. The only time I notice it is when no music is playing and my phone is making system sounds. The drivers seem to have a sleep mode or something similar when no sound is being played and will trigger when the OS uses sound. That being said, I have had 0 issue noticing the sound when audio is playing, regardless of volume. Podcasts, music, and YouTube videos all sound great. 7 different sizes of tips and 3 wing sizes are included. I have asymmetrical ears and was able to find a perfect fit. Seal is good. Don't hesitate if you intend to use these mainly for music. Very VERY solid buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-18,Bad fit,The product would not stay in the ear. It was a poor fit for my ear canal
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-18,Buy These Now,Incredible. That's my review.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-18,Comfort and performance,I have walked to each end of the house and they stay connected and the sound they put out musically is off the chain..and wearing one for phone calls they sound just the same...I can hear u clearly...with multiple ear adjustments that come with u get a great fit
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-18,These absolutely suck. Buy something else.,"I bought these, as all Anker products I've ever owned were fantastic. They have a very noticeable buzzing that comes in and out. Customer Service sent me a new pair that were supposedly ""fixed"" but they were even worse. I really hope they figure out their problem (The gain is set too high for the onboard amplifiers) and these would be great. Returned direct to Anker, they issued a refund."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-18,Stays in Your Ears,"The fin helps these actually stay in place. Other headphones never stay in my ears, which is a much bigger concern for heavy, expensive, true wireless earbuds. Though I'm no audiophile, I find the sound is great. Definitely as good or better than any other headphones I've used."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,Great sound! Great fit!,Love the quality. Really impressed with all of the different sizes of cushions to fit in the ear. Much better than having a snorkel hanging out of your ear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,Best priced balanced iem I own....,These are the best sounding iems I own! You can't go wrong with the clear balanced sound and the price they want for them! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-19,Great sounding ear buds when they work,"These are great sounding ear buds. Their hear ID works great and really setup a profile that worked for me. They also support AptX which makes music sound that much better. Bass is great on these as well as the mids and highs. The app they have is great and has a TON of preset equalizer options, a custom one, and also a personalize one using their HearID feature. My only issue with these and it's why I had to return them is that the left bud would constantly not connect. Turning it on or off wouldn't always fix the issue. there would be times I would have to put them in the case and reset them. That also resets the HearID setting and you have to run through that process each time. Anker support was great and sent me out a new set but they started to do the same thing after a few days. In the end I sadly had to send them back. It was disappointing as when they work they sound amazing. But the frustration of them not working all the time was too much. I will check back when they update the model as the sound is just too good to not take a chance on their next version of this. Hopefully the issue will be resolved. So far Soundcore products I have are great sounding for a fair price. They may not have all the bells and whistles some other brands have like NC or Ambient modes but they beat them all with better sound quality. Also their customer support is great."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,What’s most important to know?,Love everything about them except the fact that they tend to slip off/fall off every now and then.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,Great buy for the price,"The sound is great, and the price is right! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-19,very good,very good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-19,Boomin Bass,"Great for Music for BASS heads, would give 5 stars but making phone calls It always calls the wrong person when asked in my call list. Otherwise Great product! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-19,Sound Is Better than Sennheiser HD650 with amp But...,"I don't care what some say, the advertising regarding the sound is not exaggerated. It's incredible. But the fit for me is absolutely horrendous. I am forever adjusting them back into place and running with them is just a complete joke. I have tried all the combinations of ear lobe and ear canal attachments. They are simply heavy and stick too far outside the year. Some report a different ergonomic experience. But I must have had at least a dozen earpod style headphones and I've never had a problem with a fit of any of them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,So much better than AirPod Pros!,"My friend at work was the first one to tell me about these headphones. We work at a cellular store and we’re very big into our tech and accessories. I had just gotten the new iPhone 11 Pro Max and I was telling him how I wanted to try the new AirPod pros but didn’t really want to drop $250 on them. He recommended the Liberty 2 Pro’s after seeing the video on Jerry Riggs everything‘s YouTube channel. I read a ton of reviews about there is and what mainly sold me at first I was the aspect of their customer service. I was hesitant after reading the reviews about the ‘hissing’ thing but felt comfortable in trying them out once I realized how great their customer service seemed to be. Now that I’ve purchased them, I can say that I am SO glad I got the liberty to Pro instead of the AirPods. The battery life is fantastic and I love the but I can charge them wirelessly. They also are so comfortable in my ears, I wear these at work and at the gym and they are perfect. The sound quality is insane, there’s also an app where you can customize profiles depending on what kind of music you are listening to you. The connect easily, have many different options of earpieces, aren’t heavy - I could go on and on with the things I like about these. I’ve never heard any hissing in my headphones, I’m not sure if maybe I’m just lucky or if that problem has been completely resolved but I’m so happy that I got these. Two other coworkers of mine have ordered these because of My great experience with my pair and they love theirs as well. I highly recommend these and I think they are better than the AirPod Pros by a mile. Not only did I save money but I feel like the battery life is much longer and the sound quality is hard to beat. I wanted to write this review for all those people in my same situation because I was hesitant at first but I really could not be happier with my choice. Thanks Anker!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,Great bluetooth headphones,As advertised. Love you can control with voice.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-19,Great sound quality,"Excellent customer service. Great sound. Easy BT connect. Even with good ear seal, noise cancellation is deficient."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-20,Great buy.,"I really like these. They are not really noise cancelling. Maybe someday...
The sound quality is good and they have very good battery life. I am in the audio transducer design business and I would recommend them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,Review,They're good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,Good sound quality,"I enjoy the sound, the case, the wireless charging. They have a good sound, sound IQ is nice. I am very happy. They are comfortable."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,Buy these or else...,"After I searched, read reviews and asked friends what to get I kept seeing get ipods but along with that there was an ad for the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro. So I ordered them thinking there has to something to them if there's always an ad rivaling the statement from said influencer. Thank God I did. They are awesome in sound quality, volume, comfort, call quality, ability to use either bud one at a time, speed of connectivity and above all the customization via the app. I love these buds! I forgot to mention the battery life of both the buds and case. It is exceptionally good. Buy these!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,Dope... Dope... Dope...,"I luv everything... For my ears, these are so damn perfect! The bass, mids, and highs all shine! And the app is pretty damn cool as well..."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,best earbuds and affordable,everything is amazing
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-21,Sound,everything was all right with this earpods battery life was good sound quality was very good but only one thing that kept on bothering me it was a prolong I had in my ear the wings hurt my ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,Great quality sound,Love the quality sound that comes from these and the app which uses hearing id to perfect the sound for your ears
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-21,Love them.,"Wowww. These sound amazing. I never write reviews, but I had to. I'm hearing sounds I didn't know existed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-21,In my opion the soundcore2 ltp has a great sound rich bass could do a click more volume,It was not comfortable in the ear the right side of the earburs plays lower than the right big problem
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-22,Price is right,I have had issues with finding a pair of ear buds to fit. These fit ok for me. No complaints. I would like for them to be somewhat louder. The price is right.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-22,Convenience,Sound amazing to too heavy and bulky... and to do anything as far as noise canceling you have to use their app. Went with the AirPods pro instead. Way better package overall
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,0,2020-02-22,"I owned another model, the Soundcore Liberty Lite","After owning 8 months, the base stopped charging and the earbuds eventually died."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-22,Awesome sound quality,"Once you get the correct combo of the many, many tips and wings that are supplied, sound quality is the best ive heard after many pairs of buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-22,I'm loving my Soundcores!,"Up until I bought my Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pros I have been using Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10's which are wired and have 3 Knowles Balanced armatures per side. I'm really taken by Anker's hybrid design. The dynamic driver delivers awesome bass, really I was a bit shocked at the depth, while the balanced armature delivers miss and highs not achievable by a single dynamic driver. For me, the fit is better than any earbud I've ever owned. I got lucky, mine were the perfect fit right out of the box. Once inserted, they stay put even with vigorous head shaking. The battery life is exceptional and let me the majority of the day at work on a single charge. The buds and case seem very well constructed and sturdy with a quality feel to them. I'm really pleased with this purchase, and I actually like these far better than my trusty old TripleFi's."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-23,Great battery life,Battery life is excellent. Sound quality and noise cancellation very good. Overall great value.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-23,Soundcore nails it again,"Great set of earphones. The app is a must have as it gives you endless possibilities for customizing them to sound however you want. The bass is insane for such a small package, the kids are nice, and the high could be a bit more pronounced but that could all be tweaked with the eq (mostly). Wish they had anc but for the price and the sound quality you are receiving it doesn't seem too bad to not have. Battery life is also amazing !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-23,Boom boom but still ahh ahhh,"Firstly, I’ve had Powerbeats Pro, Airpods Pro, Airpods, Sony Wf-1000xm3’s, and Sony WH-1000xm3’s (the headphones everyone agrees are the best sounding for the money), so I know what good headphones sound like. These are good headphones
I’m going to address the most common complaints I’ve seen in the reviews so far:
HISSING/STATIC
- update the firmware via the SoundCore app and this goes away. Mine came shipped with the new firmware so I didn’t have this issue. The most annoying hissing I hear by far is from other reviewers. TOO MUCH BASS
- That’s subjective. I think they have a good amount of bass, I find that the default setting is my favorite. Anker has a pretty robust EQ system in the app, so this is fully adjustable. They even have a “bass reduction” preset that completely neuters the bass if you hate fun. CONNECTION ISSUES
- haven’t had an issue at all
CANT CONNECT MULTIPLE DEVICES
- .....disconnect first? That’s every Bluetooth device ever
THEY HURT/MY EARHOLES ARE BLEEDING
- please see a medical professional
-...because these are perfectly comfortable and didn’t cause your injury
The best part about these headphones are that they have extremely strong bass with exceptional clarity and separation. No matter how loud they get or how much bass the song has, you can clearly hear all other parts of the song. The soundstage is fantastic. To word that sentence in a way some of the other reviewers here can actually understand, “HEADPHONE GO BOOM BOOM BUT SING STILL AHHHHH GOOD”
Do yourself a favor, if you’re looking for good workout headphones, get these. They’re the best I’ve heard so far. If you’re looking for the best overall headphones, and don’t mind the fact that you cannot get them wet or sweaty, get one of the Sony 1000xm3’s (go with the over-ear ones if you can make it work, they’re the best sounding by far, but the wireless ones are a close second)"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-23,This is a must buy!,Best wireless earbuds I've gotten so far!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-23,Esthetically they did not work for me. Good quality and sound though.,I returned this item not i due to performance or quality but because they were rather bulky. They sat rather far off the ear and the appearance want what i expected.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-23,Definitely recommend as Bose or Beats alternative.,Like these earpieces as much or more than Bose. Battery life is great. You won't be disappointed.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-23,Great earphones,"I absolutely love these ear phones. The sound quality is great, and they are comfortable to wear. They can also withstand sweat, so I can gym and sweat without a problem. The hissing sound when I took calls was there at some point, but I no longer hear it. I assume a firmware update has sorted it out."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-24,Sound quality is great,Overall good; but when talking to people at times they have bad feed to hear me or breaks in speech. Not sure if it is just the mic issue. Will have to find out.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-24,"Great range, bass, and fit","Used for running on the track
The range is really good. Can go away form my phone for about 100meter with perfect sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,0,2020-02-24,More like Sound Core Liberty Hiss!,I really wanted to like these but the hiss is to loud to ignore I got a replacement and the second pair still has the hiss just not as loud. They offered me a 15% refund the third time as if it's my fault they made headphones with a hiss.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-25,Fantastic earbuds for the price.,"This is one of my favorite earbuds having used Bose Soundsports, Zolo Liberty, and Apple Airbuds. I pre-ordered this earbud back in October. Overall, I am amazed with the sound quality, the battery life 8hr +, and the overall quality of the product is perfect to wear every day at work and it blocks out all additional noise in the office. I did have Bluetooth issues with my first pair headphones. My phone had trouble connecting to both headphones at once. I think that was due to my device thinking each left and right earbuds are its own speakers. I filed a ticket and Anker responded the next day and sent a replacement shortly. I've yet to have any additional issues and I've been using this earbud constantly everyday for the past few months."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-25,Battery life is great I could go 3 to 4 days on a full charge.,Very comfortable clear sound use it every day on my bus commute home .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-26,"Was on the fence, but not anymore","I've owned quite a few true wireless earbuds, and I love Anker products. I own the Soundcore Pro Bluetooth speaker, but my wife swiped it from me, and she loves it. I own cheap earbuds, and a pair of Galaxy Buds. The buds fit very well, and they sound nice, but I wanted some buds that had a lot more punch. Enter the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro. These are amazing. Don't let the weird look fool you. They're long and they dangle a bit, but who cares when they sound this good! The equalizer settings aren't a gimmick, it changes the sound profile immensely. Bass is thumping, most people find it overpowering, but I love it. The highs though. They sound amazing. A piece of advice: do not turn on treble booster. Your eardrums will hate you. Overall, I loved these. I've reviewed a few Anker products in the past, so I'll say it again: their customer service is top notch. A lot of people complained about a hissing sound, but honestly, I've heard a hissing sound coming from ALL of my headsets, wired or wireless. Don't let that deter you from picking these up. I love my Galaxy Buds for their portability factor, but at home, I rock these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-26,Get Them!,These ear buds are AWSOME! I wouldrecimend these to any one that loves quality sound and are audiophiles. I cant say enough about these ear buds. Bit they are better than the Bose....the the over your ear Apple Beats...and a slew of other top shelf ear anything. Hats off to Sound Core very good job. The only thing that its missing is the active noise cancelling. But to be truthful it doesn't need it!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,"Great sound, instructions unclear","Sound is fabulous, especially if you are coming from airline earbuds. They are easy to stick in your ear and they stay there and keep out ambient noise. If you can figure out how to turn them on. Any 10-year-old can probably operate these with ease, but senior citizens like me who like good sound need our hands held. Took me about two weeks to figure out and I still don’t always get it right. Amazon should have a special help section for seniors."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,Awesome earbuds in every way,"These are my new favorite toy. I am a software developer and so I listen to music or white noise pretty much all day. Sound quality of these buds is just amazing… full, powerful bass and super crisp highs all at the same time. I use these with at least three different devices, and the Bluetooth pairing process (pressing a button on the case while the buds are inside) is very easy. And the connection is very strong once it does connect... you don’t lose connection in one (or both) ears as you walk around, unlike other Bluetooth earbuds/headsets I own. The wireless charging option is so convenient too! Great earbuds ... I highly recommend them!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-26,Left ear bud stoped working,They worked great for the first month or so then the left ear bud just completely stopped connecting to my phone..
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,Solid headphones with good bass,"White noise floor is a little too high, but you get used to it. The slider case is satisfying but I'm unsure if it'll hold up well overtime. I do not recommend the signature sound, let it do the Hear ID instead. Otherwise very solid headphones, with a nice app."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,The best sound quality,It's really the best sound quality
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-26,Great for everything but conversation,These are great for music or listening to a book...the phone conversation quality is non existent. My clients could not hear me sufficiently to have a conversation.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,Almost perfect!,"Update: Costumer service contacted me and I feel like an idiot lol... pressing the button once do the Play/Pause option! I don’t read manuals for gadgets. The reason I was confused is because the app when using the Liberty Air 2 does show the option for play/pause but not in this Liberty 2 Pro. Original Review:
These are great earbuds. Almost prefect. Excellent audio, confortable, great battery life and manual equalizer with the app. Price is good but if you are like me, you add the product in the wishlist and eventually you will find that the price decreased 😃
The only bad thing: there is not an option to play/pause with the button. Seriously? I have the option to do this with the liberty air 2 with the app... But not with the more expensive and almost perfect ones. I'll update my review when the do the update. Sorry I just feel disappointed!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,great,love these!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-26,All good,Amazing!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-27,Best phones ever,Perfext in everything!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-27,Sound quality is impressive,"Lots of bang for just a few bucks... Great fit with the right tips. I love the sound quality and overall tone of these little gems....
My new everyday go to buds...."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-27,Great sounds and a great price!,I have had these since about the end of November 2019. I wanted to wait a few months before leaving a review. The sound quality is top notch and the battery life is awesome. The customizable app is really nice as well. Highly recommended
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-27,Nearly Perfect,"I returned the AirPods Pro I had ordered from Amazon due to some connection issues but there are other obvious flaws with them that I won’t get into here. The big flaw for me was they would always get loose in my ears after a few minutes and would eventually fall out if not constantly pushed back in. Needless to say, not an issue with the Liberty 2 Pro. While they are a bit large, they fit my ears snuggly and don’t move at all even after several hours and they stay comfortable to wear. They are lower profile than my Bose Soundsports and the music quality is top notch. With that said, you do need to tailor the sound to your liking. The Soundcore app has several ways to do this which saves the sound profile directly on the earbuds. The Hear ID test sets EQ based on a type of 3 min hearing test it does in the app. There are stock profiles like you can get on iOS, but the new feature that apparently wasn’t available previously is a fully customizable manual EQ that saves your EQ profiles to your online account in case you switch phones. Nice. The app also gives you the ability to customize the buttons on the Liberty 2 Pro so you can control volume rather than Siri or Google Assistant. The case is a bit large but easily pocketable and has a slight grippy texture on it that the AirPods cases do not have. I was always losing a handle on my Airpods case. The top of the case slides and is my only real concern from long term reliability as it looks like it could be broken without too much force. The case’s wireless charging is nice as well. Battery life is great. The last few days at work I have used them nearly a full 8 hours straight and still have some battery left. Way better than the 4 hours I was getting with Airpods. That was really annoying for a $250 set of earbuds. Speaking of price, these are way cheaper too at $149. I got mine for $129 which made them even better. Bluetooth pairing was very easy and has been rock solid. Not a single drop or crackle yet. Many people have complained of a background hiss. I’ve heard no such hiss. That may have been an early manufacturing defect or maybe was solved with a firmware update. Either way, I’ve had no issues. My only thing to improve these would be to make them a bit smaller so they are closer to the ear, add touch controls, add a hearing pass through, and maybe work on making the case a bit more robust. I don’t want noise cancellation on my earbuds as the technology makes my ears feel like there is pressure on them. Not comfortable. Besides the seal is so good on these, much of the ambient noise is blocked anyway. Those are my only real “gripes”. They really do everything that I was expecting out of a quality set of buds so take it from somebody that lives in the Apple universe, save yourself some money and frustration and buy a set of these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-02-27,If you can ignore the constant static hiss...,"I was always happy with many Anker (and their related brands) products and finally decided to get a pair of wireless headphones. They look and feel good and fit well into the ears. The case is also very nice. I've read other reviews about static hissing, as well as some people mentioning that the problem was resolved in more recent production batches. Unfortunately it is not true, and the problem still exists as of February 27, 2020. In my pair the constant hissing is more audible in the left earbud, and slightly less in the right one. I'm near 40 and I do not have particularly sensitive hearing, especially compared to my teenage daughter (as we checked recently she can hear wider frequency range). I paired the earbuds with various devices trying to put the blame first on my phone, or the tablet, or the laptop - but in all cases the hissing is present, it is quite audible and it did not go away even after downloading their app and upgrading the firmware to the most recent version. If it were a hissing power charger, I would maybe removed a single star if at all (I'm not there to listen to power chargers after all). But for an audio device whose primary function is to play sound - sorry Anker/Soundcore but the hissing means that all stars go away."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-27,"Great, clear sounding ear buds.",I like quality sound and these do a Avery good job. One concern they went on sail right after I bought a pair. : )
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-27,some good quality ear buds,performed very well no complaints
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-27,Ok,Ok
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-27,"Great earbuds for music, not so much for calls","Best sounding pair of total wireless earbuds I have, for music. Sometimes, it gets out of sync, but syncs back in 1a few seconds. As for calling, not the greatest quality... Will have to raise volume of voice a bit"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-28,Very pleased.,"I have zero complaints. These were 66%+ charged upon receipt, installed the app, connected without any issues. I used the custom interfacing through app.
Sounds great! Battery life seems good. Used for a call and was told it sounded more clear than some of the equally priced headset only devices."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-28,"Good buy, watch out for minor audio hiss","They have good sound but it does have a slight audio hiss on quieter parts of music or shows. Not the worst hiss though and I’m fairly picky about this issue. I think the Jabra 75’s hiss was worse. Other than that, the battery life is great, they stay on nicely during basic workouts with right wing/tip combo (mind your ears on hack squat machine yokes), and they don’t cut out with regular body movements (another issue I found w/Jabra). I hope this helps!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-28,Great product,Great product... love the pri
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-02-28,Died after a few weeks,Im pissed off that these decided to stop pairing! They were good until now
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-28,Very good,"These are perfect for listening to music. The sound is phenomenal definitely have to use the app to set your settings tho. For me I only use them for music. There is no noise cancelation but they are loud enough to where you do not hear any background noise. Microphone is Ok. If these had noise cancelation, transparency mode, and a better microphone they would be 100% the best true wireless earbuds. Can’t beat the price tho."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-28,Best wireless earbuds I've owned,"Wow, these earbuds are amazing. The mids are highs are on point and theres just enough bass to where you feel it but not too overpowering. As for the noise cancellation goes, it's average, I can hear a little outside noise but not to the point where its overpowering my music. The battery lasts a while I havent charged them since I recieved them in the mail and its been 2 days. I also love the way the case opens, its really satisfying the way it slides back and forth. The case isn't too big or too small, its sleek and super portable. I have heard a lot of rumors that these earbuds have a bad hissing sound but I havent had that problem at all before or after the firmware update. All in all these are so pretty great earbuds for the money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-28,Soooooooo good,Really nice one
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-28,"Great sound, cool look and noise cancelling",These things are pretty great. Sound quality is superb and clear. I got these for my workouts and they have stood up to the test so far. I'm not an audiophile necessarily but I definitely look for good quality sound and these have it. Wish they got a little louder but that is my only complaint. I did not have an issue with call quality like others have shared. Calls sounded clear and the caller on the other end could hear me clearly.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-29,"Great for music, terrible for calls.","Pros: Excellent sound quality, the personal ID equalizer thought their app is awesome. Cons: Voice call quality is terrible inspite of claims of multiple mics with cutting-edge cVc technology. Right earphone was losing charge about an hour and a half sooner than the left earphone."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-29,2nd Updated review. The sound quality is awesome!,"The mids and highs are very crisp and clear, but there was hardly any bass. I tried all equalizer settings. The right earbud would not sry in properly. I tried all the tips and none would work. Main reason for return was the lack of bass. For the price I expected much more. I bought some $39 ones (Tranya T3) and they had nearly the same quality for mids and highs, plus lots of bass. They also fit perfectly right out of the box. This company rocks! They sent me another pair for free! I did not expect that! I put them in and these still are not as loud as the other ones, but there is definitely more bass! Now overall I have to say the sound quality is excellent! If you consider yourself an audiophile, these are the headphones. Quality of the sound is extremely good! I still have an issue with the right side not fitting as good as the left, but I’ll play around with the inserts to see if I can get it to fit better. Give these a chance! I may have had a defective pair initially. Finally I went riding on my bicycle and started out with the less expensive headphones and a new jazz playlist. They weren’t putting out the bass I was use to. Switched to the Soundcore headphones and , WOW, what a difference! These have so much note clarity with the mids and treble and the bass was perfect. These are my got to headphones for sure! Can’t go wrong with these headphones!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-29,Perfect gift for my son!,Excellent product that does not disappoint!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-29,Perfect Bluetooth Buds,"Super comfortable and amazing sound clarity. These stay in even while working an active job or exercising. Great bass and crisp highs, and they pair seamlessly with no headache or fuss. Get em!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-02-29,So So earbuds.....,Sound quality seemed to be good but after trying to get a good seat with different ear tips and wings I gave up.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-29,These Headphones are Amazing,"Way Better Then I imagined, Super Great Sound, fit in my ears well, don't fall out when you move your head, easy hook up, And Sound Great, A must if you like wireless Headphones"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-29,Amazing Sound Quality - Great Charging Case!,"Its so cool to find a truly awesome product on amazon like these Anker Liberty 2 Pro earbuds. Coming from the samsung galaxy earbuds (which I really loved when used with the app only and my galaxy phone), these earbuds are like hearing the music for the first time. The sound stage is better than the bose I used to own. The bass response is very strong, but not overly booming. Also, the app worked very well with no weird problems and pairing was also simple to a samsung galaxy s8+ and no BT connection drops. The case. It is fantastic, it feels very high end and I love the way it opens. USB-C and wireless charging worked very well. The longer I listen to these, the better they sound and the more vocal & instrument detail I can identify. The technology in these is really great and well worth the cost. The packaging (who cares) is also very high-end and nice esp the magnet that keeps it closed. When listening with Spotify on Very High streaming, and normalize volume off, the power of the sound is truly astounding. Obviously a good source helps a lot (1980s GO-GOs wont sound that great of course). When there is no sound (between tracks) there is total silence. No buzzing, no electronic humm, nothing. Its perfect. I havenet tested the battery claims yet (32hrs) but honestly I can charge them wirelessly anytime so its not a huge deal for me. Call quality I have not tested much, I never use earbuds when taking a voice call I just take them out. Between the samsung galaxy buds, bose buds, Jabra 65t, the new sony buds (i returned them and did not like their dull/flat sound quality) and these --- there is no contest, the Anker product is totally superior. I would never trust a vine paid reviewer for any product on amazon - why are they allowed?"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-29,The music sounds amazing,"I use this product mostly for music. I do love the way I can hear more of the musics details that you can only hear with studio headphones. I always love that they cost a decent amount. I think that when using them for calls could improve, the mic I think could be better."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,Excellent Buds for the price!!!,These buds are very good. The bass and treble have a good mix and they are loud! I use these mainly to listen to instrumentals for the clarity of each track. For the price these are awesome!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,What Are You Waiting For..,"If you are reading this I’m sure you’re looking at making a purchase for some wireless ear buds.. What are you waiting for, buy them now!! I’ve been a drummer for 40 years and I personally have been in and out of recording studios for 30 years and these sound amazing.. The highs are clear and the lows come through without sounding muddy.. They handle everything from Cannibal Corpse to Snoop Dogg and I’m sure they can handle anything in between.. Death Metal guitars, bass, and drums are reproduced quite nicely and even Hip Hop heads will love these also.. If I could give them six stars, I would.."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,Absolutely Astonishing!,"Perfectly crisp highs, unbelievably deep lows. These are incredible! I'm so pleased with this purchase:-)"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-01,Poor connection issues.,"Excellent rating in sound, comfort, and battery life. However, the sound cuts out frequently."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-01,Keep on tinkering,"I got these earbuds after a lot of research. At first I couldn't get a good fit; they kept wiggling during my runs. I swapped ot the ear pieces and fins a couple times and finally found the perfect fit. I downloaded the app and tried out all the different presets for styles of music. They were all okay, nothing that made me love these earbuds more than any other ones that I've tried. Then I did the personalization, which involves tapping the screen when you can hear tones. I didn't expect much after doing this (heck, I wasn't sure I was even doing it correctly), but holy cow! The difference was phenomenal! Honestly, if it weren't for the app, I'd be a little disappointed with my purchase. So, getting the perfect fit and having it personalized to my exact hearing have made it an absolutely incredible experience every time I use them. Buy these, download the app and enjoy. Side note: I haven't noticed the hissing sound a lot of the negative reviews talk about. Maybe the manufacturer has corrected the problem."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,Good quality,Sound great
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,Right brand,It's what suspected in the review for the ear phones
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,La Verdad!!!,"The bass extension on these is incredible. I’m not applying any EQ or even using the Anker app, right out of the box these things just rock. I wouldn’t put them up against reference headphones or anything over Bluetooth for that matter due to audio compression inherent in Bluetooth. I don’t like noise cancellation and these are really good at passively blocking out noise. I will update after I do a couple of workouts to comment on active use but my initial impression is that they’ll rock."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-01,Great sound,Sent back due to Ear discomfort. Could be the weight. Great sound though. Maybe they won’t hear your ears.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-01,Great value but wish they had noise cancellation.,Amazing sounding earbuds at a great price. It's just too bad that they don't offer any noise cancellation and that they are a bit big in the ear.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-02,Some of the best earbuds ever!,"Probably some of the best earbuds I have ever tried. Everything about them is awesome... Only complaint is that they are a bit big. Sound is phenomenal, battery life and controls are excellent."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-02,nice,like this product
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-03-02,"Cheap, Definite hiss, short battery, good sound.","Update: Purchased these roughly 4 months ago, the left ear bud has stopped working. It makes a crackling noise and the audio cuts in and out. Have tried restarting, recharging nothing fixes this new issue. Decent sound, definite hiss throughout most of my listening. Battery lasts for about an hour and a half maybe two, then the right earbud starts LOUDLY telling me ""Battery Low!"""
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-02,Excellent buy!,"I have several earbuds, these are ranked in the top two. Excellent sound, profiles, options - - user friendly. Battery life is great, the custom sound option is something I've never seen. Excellent buy!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-02,Worth every penny...,The sound is awesome and they are super comfortable!! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-03,Really good buds,"Really like these buds. Hurts my ears after a couple hours, might need to adjust the tips."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-03,Great sound. sharp clear with strong bass,Great sound and quality.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-03,Absolutely the best TWS buds at a great price!,"I'll start off by simply saying: These are the best TWS I have ever owned. I've been an Anker fan for what feels like a decade. All their products are quality and a great value. This one is no different. The charging case is the best by far out of any of the many I own. The case is smooth but grippy enough and fits in the pocket so well I don't even notice it. The case can be charged via USB C or my favorite, wirelessly. You get a few charges out of the case and I've never ran out of juice on the buds or the case with infrequent case charging. The packaging is amongst the best out there if you're into that. Other bits include a selection of silicone tips and wings. The biggest size works great for me. My only complaint is sometimes the the wing can rotate off the bud if handled roughly but this has only happened twice within months of use. Pairing is trouble-free. The buds fit nicely and secure in the ear without sticking out. The connection to phone is top notch. These headphones sound great just like the other products from the company but just to a whole new level. I gave plenty of time to break in the drivers. I can honestly say these have the best sound quality of any TWS buds out there. Sound quality is great for music. Voices for podcast are super clear and full. No tinyness even with low bitrate samples. These are excellent True Wireless Buds. The app allows you to choose from a set of preset, custom, or HearID equalizers. I recommend you set it to Piano if you just want something out of the box. Ideally run through the super easy personalization wizard and it will tune in the equalizer to exactly fit your hearing. This works amazingly. The app also allows for firmware updates, which there have at least 3 in a few months. I love that they keep perfecting a product even after it is sold. I could go on but I will make it simple. If you are in the market for TWS buds then you have found them. You will not find anything near this quality at this great pricing. A note: the very first launch edition of these had a possibility of very low tone static when nothing is playing. They quickly remedied this and there are 0 problems. Buy these, you will not be disappointed."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-03,Great quality sound,Sound quality is very good but it doesnt lock in my ear so much
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-03,A value buy for an all-rounder!,"Sound quality is excellent. With the equalizer app you can fine tune music to your liking... I am a big bass head so I turn that all the way up! But with this you can hear all the musical instruments; the highs, moods and lows. On pair with my seinheiser earbuds I have that cost 2x the price. Design wise; this is in the big side as they protrude out the ear a little bit. But worth the sacrifice for the sounds quality you get. Price; for the price you pay, this is a value buy! On par with any $300 dollar earbuds. Noise isolation; no ANC but no need! Once these are on and the music is playing you literally can’t hear anything but the music and instruments. Wear these to the gym and basically get lost in my world and can focus on my workout without hearing anything around me. Would not wear these for swimming despite the IPX rating. Overall getting a lot for the price! I have earbuds ranging from seinheiser all the way to taotronics and these are right up there with the best. Also very durable so if dropped, nothing breaks. Can beat the combination of value and quality."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-03,Good,Good but no better than the non pro version. Save your money and get them. I have both now. Maybe slightly better battery life with the pro but both are rated at 8 hours and neither gets that.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-03,"Hiss? Def, but you can easily get past it.","The ""Hiss"" is real but I could have forgotten about it over time as the mind adapted. The audio quality is truly remarkable and def deserves 5 stars I only deducted for the hiss sound when connecting or dis-connecting from music tracks. The reason I returned is the syncing to bluetooth. I've owned airpods since they first came out so I'm use to very fast instant connections (in that respect I'm bias) and if your use to 10-30 seconds to connect I wouldn't hesitate to buy these. I had so many bluetooth issues either syncing to my 2015 vehicle or my iphoneX that I just couldn't bear to keep trying after a week of multiple times a day usage. Sometimes it took nearly two minutes in my vehicle to get it to link up. Secondly they are mono-sound for single pod usage, which is so much quieter than dual usage. I use my airpods frequently as a single pod so this also became a major ""doh"" for me. I had really high hopes for these after watching numerous youtube guys talk them up. In the end no ones coming close yet to touching apples H1 chip in their pods. Like no ones even a 3 yet compared to apples 5. I purchased the new airpod pros. Of course it's a never look back decision. Hope this helps. If you like exceptional audio and wear your pods 2 at a time (always) this is a great purchase you can easily get past the hiss for the couple a seconds it affects. Hopefully the bluetooth connections will improve with updates in Ankers app which is also a stellar feature for the customizable in audio. The case, battery life, and call quality were all above pair in this market to beat the H1 chip."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-04,Great sound quality but hiss noise,I was surprised and pleased by the sound quality when I first got it. I do think it is really next level quality for true wireless earbuds. Using apps is must. Choosing different equalizer makes sound different. Using correct size ear hooks and tips made me feel very comfortable too. However the hiss noise exist as many people mentioned. Maybe I am more sensitive than average people but it kept bothering me. I contacted customer service and got confirmed mine is revised version so I returned it. Customer service was very supporting by the way. I appreciated. I do miss the sound quality though. If those hiss noise doesn't bother this earbuds are really good.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-04,Best true wireless earbuds in the market right now.,These earbuds are something else. Definitely the best true wireless earbuds I've ever used.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-04,Just buy them!,After doing the research I decided to buy these earbuds. Bought several pairs before but these are the best for my money! !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-05,Love them,They are my daily driver. Great audio quality but the right ear has some cracking noises.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-05,So good,JUST BUY IT.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-05,Wiw,Excellent product.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-05,Good quality and comfortable,Really good quality and you can run with it everything will be okay
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-06,Best for audiophiles ONLY,"Pretty good although I gotta hate these because these they’re so bulky. They stick out of your ear too much so when running they tend to want to come out. The 3 ipx rating is a no go for me as I would like to run in the rain and work out with these so they could short out easily. All negatives aside the sound is pretty good, when using the Soundcore sound signature in their app so it sounds pretty balanced. The personal signature thing is kinda useless unless you actually have hearing problems and would be better if you could customize your own signature as well. Bass is there it doesn’t sound to quiet or loud and that goes for highs and mids as well. The case is pretty alright, kinda gimmicky in my opinion as it slides open but the usb-c is pretty cool. Bottom line don’t get these if you want to workout or even commute, they’re only really good for audiophiles who want to use them for listening to music. I won’t say anything about the call quality because Idgaf about call quality so find another review if you care so much about it."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-06,Very good and compact,"The earbuds sound great and are comfortable to wear (you have to kind of twist them into your ear, then they suddenly sit in just right). I just got them and the battery was fully charged so i don't know yet about battery life. They are compact and don't have the longer piece that other earbuds have."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-06,Perfect product,Probably the best headphones out. And affordable
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-07,"Amazing sound, fit and quality!","These are great! In fact, so good I bought a second pair just for work. Bass is amazing. Not the ""tinny/small"" sound that I've experienced with other earbuds. Battery life is excellent and with all of the different earpieces provided, there is no way you won't have a perfect fit. Almost noise canceling capable. Great product!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-07,Best earbuds Anker makes.,"Some of the best earbuds I have ever owned. They offer excellent battery life. 32 hours of play time, up to 8 hours when fully charged and then 3 more charges in the case. Deep bass and clear vocals make these earbuds a good choice for a variety of genres. Magnetically held in the case so less risk of them accidentally falling out. HearID when setup properly makes a notable improvement to the stock EQ settings. I alternate between these and Samsung buds but find myself using these more often. Combine all that with the superior support from Anker and you can't go wrong. Highly recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-07,Sounds not as good as bose,I like to compare. Currently I have a Bose earbud and sounds very good. I would like to try Anker soundcore liberty 2 pro but sounds not as good like Bose. Return it on second day
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-07,Sweet Buds!,These earbuds Bang! Great clarity with no distortion at high volume. No passive hear through that the only ball drop. No Anc and no hear through they would be the best if those options were included but there among the best sounding for media consumption good call quality also. The battery life is top tier they can go for an 8 hour shift easy.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-07,Lives up to its description!,"I'm very picky when it comes to headphones, love my rock, love my Bass. These headphones were the first purchase that I had no regrets with. Portability, sound, and battery life all were right on Par. Only issue was the necessity for downloading it's proprietary app to enjoy all the EQ settings that come with it. Would recommend to anyone still, great buy."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-07,#1 Audio hands down,"Best sounding audio in the game. The only thing I wish it had, was ambient pass through. Otherwise, these headphones are the truth, PERIOD. I didn’t believe the hype... they’re as good as advertised."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-03-07,Not worth,Not worth the premium
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-07,"Great sound, app has tons of EQs but just didnt fit snug.",I love everything about them except one thing amd unfortunately its a big one. Sound quality is great and the app has EQs for everyone's listening pleasure. Button layout is easy to use and customizable to a small extent and phone calls have been good but not great with some instances of feedback. Although they come with several sized ear buds the major gripe i have is that I cant get them to stay in after a while. I find myself having to readjust them in my ear to get them back snug. Id recommended them on the sound quality alone and hoping to find some way to get a better fit with these buds
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,These will be your favorite,"The sound is excellent. I've been testing A LOT of ear buds and these are by far the best. My only complaint is that the buds don't shut off instantaneously when you put them back in the case. But, that's it. The build quality seems very solid and the case is my favorite to date."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,Better than Bose Soundsport,"OMG these are awesome! I'm an audiophile and I've tried 4 different true wireless earbuds in the past 2 months, trying to find the best sound, long battery, noise cancellation, staying in my ear, etc. I use them primarily at the gym and phone conversations in my car. I dont hear any of the external gym noises, and I don't have to max the volume. Very simple design, easy to use. I found that with these, and they even sound much cleaner than my Bose Soundsport! All the sounds are much crisper. The downloadable Soundcore APP allows you to run a hearing test to customize the ear pieces' sound and much more. Very highly recommended! Anker is really pumping out some quality product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,Sound great,There were many complaints about a hissing. Its pretty much nonexistent. Over happy with the purchase
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,Good product,Sound is very good and connection between them as well
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,Excellent ear buds for the money.,"The ear buds sound quality is very good, sound stage is excellent, and battery is very, very, very good. You can't go wrong with these sound core Liberty 2 pro's."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,"Great performance, sound quality is beautiful","It has different levels of ear pieces, that feels comfortable."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-08,Good,Good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-09,Great Sound Quality,"So much passive noise canceling that it’s impossible to talk with them in. Other than that, they are exceptional. Sound is superior and the app lets to tweak to your liking."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-09,Liberty 2 pro,"These soundcores are amazing, love these!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-10,"Great earbuds for the price, good quality and battery life","Sound quality is very good for the price. Even with all the different tips, I still find it difficult to get a tight fit that is comfortable and also blocks externa noise correctly. My corded normal Shure headphones block more sound and are comfortable to wear for longer periods. They tend to become uncomfortable to wear after 3+ hours. They protrude from your ears so can rest side of head on anything with discomfort, which was expected. The app that comes with them to tube profile to your hearing is nice. Overall a great set of earbuds for the price."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,Best tws headphones hands down,"Sound quality is unmatched for the price, these should cost way more. Battery life is also amazing. Only wish they came with active noise canceling."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,WOW,"After doing research...I decided to pull the trigger and buy the Library 2 Pro. First of all let me say WOW. This is everything I expected and more. Kudos to Anker... great job, well done. You will not be disappointed"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,"Base booms, wide sound stage, comfortable",Just buy these! My friends have the high end Sony’s and Sennheiser. All that matters is how it sounds - right? Well these blow away my friends in terms of bass and breadth of soundstage. They are amazing! At $129 my friends both bought them as second (but now preferred) second set. It’s March 2020 and mine have zero of the hissing others had in the past - so relieved. Must be the firmware that updates when you first synch to phone ap. Seriously amazing! Worth every cent.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,Awesome that you can tune them for your own ears!,Battery life is reasonable. Recharge is fast. They're NOT ANC earbuds. They do block noise because they're earbuds. The clarity of the sound is awesome. I tried several others before I settled on these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,my sound cored,I like the sound and the bass is really great
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,Great,"Great sound. But you realy need to downlaod the app and go through the optimism process to get the best sound. Also it automatically does a firmware update as soon as the app is open, thats something that you cant avoid."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-10,MUST TRY! 😍,"I love these headphones! I went through 4 different pair of bt headphones before finally deciding on these. I'm a bit of an audiophile and mainly listen to EDM so my music had to be loud and the bass punchy and boy do these DELIVER in that department! The highs are SUPER crisp which I love. My only complaint is that they stick out of your ear a bit, making them appear like a regular Bluetooth headset. However, they're very comfortable and stay in during my intense workouts in the gym. No official noise cancellation but these create a pretty good deal in my ear and considering how loud they get, outside noise isn't an issue."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-11,The best I've tried out of 3 others.,Professional Hearing test/Custom EQ
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-11,Great hi fit in ear experience,I was recommended these in ears by a recording engineer and they live up to expectations. Great sound.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-11,Amazing sound from these earbuds!,I've been using these for a couple months now and they sound incredible! I had an issue where only the right side would pair to my devices so I emailed Anker and they provided me with a solution. You need to hold the button on the back until the lights on the earbuds flash red. This indicates that they have been reset and can both be paired again. The right side controls the left side pairing so resetting them allows it to pair both right and left. The battery life on these is also incredible and I've never even come close to depleting just the charge in the earbuds themselves let alone the case!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-11,Best ear buds I've found on the market.,Excellent Bluetooth ear buds. Flawless connection with one or both ear buds. Great equalizer options and perfect fit stays secure in the ear while walking or exercise.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-03-11,Better products at a lower price available. Buyer beware.,"Bought these for my wife as a gift. She uses an iPhone and after tiring of me asking what she thought, she finally let me know she could only use 1 bud at a time. Tried resolving issue with no luck. Had some significantly cheaper pair of phaiser one buds I swapped for these knowing they worked with my device. Wow, all I can say is these sound like a $10 pair and cannot hold a candle to the phaiser earbuds at 1/3 the price. Distracting hiss, no bass, and terrible sounding all around. What a waste of $150."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-03-12,Very loud audible clipping or skipping sounds often,"Oh boy. I had hopes for these, they worked pretty decent the first 6 or so hours, but that's about it. They don't charge in the case half the time, the battery seemingly goes from 100% ""high battery"" to ""low battery"" 20% after about 40 minutes (the time I leave my house to around the time I end my walk). The worse part is they constantly ""clip out"", not sure the word but it sounds like when a CD or cassette would skip. Terrible sound. Very disappointed, should save and get some good name brand ones."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-12,Sound quality far exceeds price,"Awesome sound. I recently had sent back a pair of Sennheiser buds. (a malfunction in the left bud), and decided to give the Anker’s a try. In my opinion the AS Pro 2’s sounded noticeably better at $80 less. Sound The bass is great and I really liked the way they sound in the higher ranges. They pair immediately once I initially paired them and the battery life is great , I would definitely recommend them"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-12,Better than Bose,"These are amazing headphones. Some people are annoyed by a hissing sound that is present just before audio plays, but that is part of their noise cancellation process. I absolutely love these headphones!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-13,Just received my pair - NO AUDIO HISS PRESENT,"I just recieved my pair today and have only had a brief amount of time using them. I was hesitant to purchase these earbuds because of all of the reviews that mentioned the audio hiss at low volumes. Luckily, my set does not have this issue. So far I am very happy with them, and will add content to the the review once I have had a chance to used them more extensively. I mainly wanted to share that the audio hiss is not an issue with all units. These ear buds sound fantastic, and I am looking forward to putting them through their paces."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-13,Awe product I would highly recommend these,Wasn't anything to dislike
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-13,Racegirl5204,They are awesome
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-13,Totally worth it.,I love the sound of these things and that I get a full 8 hours out of each ear. I love that I can wear either the left or the right by itself and I'm not stuck with a master. I like that they stay in my ear better than the old version. Altogether an upgrade. I wish the case battery was a bit beefier so I could go longer between charges.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-13,Great product for the price,Great product for the price. Fits snugly into the with multiple different options for different sized ears
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-03-13,Better choices for the money,White noise unbearable- anyone who says it has been fixed is lying or deaf.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-03-13,Good sound but has some bugs,Earbuds were good with excellent sound for the price except I had to pair them up to my phone multiple times. Usually I had to delete the software from my phone and reinstall which was more than annoying.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-14,Excellent wireless earbuds,"The ""Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds"" are top notch units, providing a comfortable fit with excellent sound quality. Battery life is very good and the buds fit perfectly in the charging case and charge properly every time unlike some cheaper units from other brands. Overall quality of manufacturing seems much better than most other wireless earbuds I've tried (and I've gone through almost a dozen by now) and I have high hopes that these buds won't arbitrarily break/crap out/stop charging which are the problems that I encounter most with the cheap-end competitors I've tried. These Anker buds are substantially more expensive than many others but it may be worth it to avoid the numerous problems that most cheap sets come down with."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-14,You'll never buy anything better!,These just destroyed my Klipsch x12 neck band! Hands down best head phones you can buy. The sound quality alone should make these cost more than they are and the true wireless should be an additional cost! The headphone functions are customizable so you're not stuck with whatever someone else chooses is best for you. I will be buying another pair of these for my wife!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-14,Sound quality is amazing,"These sound amazing and with the app it's way better. The only thing that I dont like is the phone calls, my party couldn't really hear me that well and I sound funny."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-15,"Great battery life, sound, and comfort.","Great battery life, fit is amazing. Clear sounds, wish they could go a little louder. Overall best ear buds I've ever bought!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-15,"pretty good, but a bit overpriced","Fit is good and comfortable, though maybe not quite as snug as it could be. Something contoured more like my ear would be better. Seems reasonably stable/secure although I've not tried any vigorous activity with them on. Controls are fine. I like that the earbud button is on the top of the earbud so that when you push it, you're not pushing the earbud further into your ear. Had no problems pairing (with a Pixel 3, HP Chromebook or Windows desktop) and the connection was stable. I did not hear any of the white noise or hiss that some have reported. I tried turning the volume way up, but still could not hear it. Sound quality right out of the box wasn't that great (flabby, bloated bass). But after some hours of use, the sound quality gets better. Clarity, mids, and soundstage are good, bass is good and plentiful without being overwhelming. The Soundcore app is recommended, although I didn't find any of the presets to my liking. The app allows you to tweak the sound signature and your settings get stored on the earbuds, so you will have the sound tweaking when you use your earbuds with a device (e.g. a PC/laptop) which does not have the Soundcore app running. Plus, you will need the Soundcore app to update the firmware on your earbuds. The case has a nice, grippy rubberized texture on the outside. The oval shape of the case makes it comfortable to hold or slip into a pocket. Here are the negatives/cons:
- soundstage is decent, but not as wide open as in the Lypertek Tevi. I found the Tevi was just more enjoyable to listen to. - earbuds are difficult to take out of the case. This is because the earbuds are stored laying on their sides when in the case and there is very little open space around the earbuds in the case. That makes it's hard to grab onto them to pull them out. (Yes, you can hold onto the earbuds' rubber wing and pull them out that way, but I think doing so would cause them to eventually break since they weren't meant for that.) The way I've found that worked well was to poke my pinky into the little space between the 2 and pry them out one at a time. Doable, but it's definitely harder than it needed to be. - while fit is good, I think it could be a little more secure with more contouring
- they are definitely good, but overpriced at $150"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-16,Expected to get a bad pair. Didn't.,"My pair have a very slight background static when video plays with no sound (such as video preview on youtube) but it's very minor and similar to the static of older bluetooth headphones. The battery life seems quite good when fully charged, but the indicator in the app may be wrong as I've seen them marked as fully charged once so far and die within a couple hours. Even with the smallest wingtips they come with they can really start to bite into your ears after a while, I probably wouldn't use them for active use because of this, and due to their size, they just won't stay in for very active workouts. Overall pleased with the sound, the EQ in the app does make a noticeable difference and I feel you can actually use more than one setting because of it (compared to say galaxy buds which you just leave on dynamic). I thought the case was a bit of a joke at first, but it's got 4 full charges in it, is still of a reasonable size that you could keep it in a pocket if you wanted, but I would probably suggest a bag if possible, and it's just a breeze to open one handed. Honestly I just like fidgeting with it too. Like a lot. Good pair for at home/at work, probably not the best for going out to the mall/whatever due to their size. Overall 8/10, if you can stand the wingtips and if you get a pair with minor to no static I think it's a good purchase, especially if you get them for $129."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-16,Superb. Surpasses the best on the market,Was looking for one set that has great bass. Purchased JBL top of the line and Nakamichi. Both outstanding bitbthis baby surpassed them. Want to hear the best? Download the equalizer app theyr recommend. Unreal.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-16,Better than my Airpods!,"The sound quality on these is very amazing. The app has a ton of preset equalizer settings, as well as the ability to let you easily customize an EQ setting. The battery life is wonderful and rivals the airpods. While it doesn't have active noise cancellation, the buds fit in your ear very well and securely, with different size silicone cushions included. They lock in your ear to block out noise. They are very comfortable. The comfort and sound quality beats my Airpods hands down."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-16,Great earbuds for the price!,"These little buds are great for this price! Bass is very well balanced, though a bit overpowering on the default EQ. Fit could be better but I always have trouble finding well fitting earbuds. But the one shining feature is the customer support! I had an issue with my old pair outside of 90 days but they replaced it free of charge. Buy with confidence!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-17,Excellent product,Overall most impressive earbuds I've ever heard.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-18,Excelente sonido!,Es sonido es muy bueno!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-18,Really great for the money,Very good product for the money. The manual says not to get wet not even splashes of water so if your thing is running or going outdoors maybe pay an extra 50 for some Bose?
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-19,Be aware of return charges even with prime,"The good: for earbuds, great sound. I don’t know if their as mind blowing as reviews on here & YouTube say, but decent. Nicely packaged. Premium feel, fit & finish. Great app.....the bad: overpriced for what you get. Should be around the 75-100$ mark. Many complaints about hiss, I think I got a newer set that I read Anker corrected by lowering the overall volume of the buds, because I could hear no hiss. The packaging is overkill. This is a page companies are taking from Apple. You take a cheap product, & put it in an elaborate package that costs pennies, it makes the buyer feel their buying something premium. Its wasteful. How Mach paper & plastic is really needed for this stuff? And now the worst thing, the fit. I tried all combinations of tips/wings & they always felt they were just barely sitting against my ear canals. Went on a brisk dog walk, & they never fell out but constantly had the sensation of them slipping out. In order for them to be loud, they have to have a large driver, that means larger, heavier earbuds. I have a pair of $28 taotronics 72s. That I’m comparing them to. Bluetooth was identical. Mic was slightly better. Sound much better. But $100 better? No. I’m not spending $130 & have to buy aftermarket tips on top of that. Now we’re into apple/galaxy/jabra territory. And just to top it off, I’m being charged $7.50 to ship back- with prime. This is not a bad review per say. Their just overpriced."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-19,Anker is the best!,"I have bought many power products from Anker over the years. They have all delivered top notch performance and reliability. I recommend Anker products to everyone I know. I bought my Liberty 2 pro ear buds at a local retailer, but they are far and away, the best earbuds I have ever owned! LOVE ANKER PRODUCTS!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-20,Beautiful earbuds,These are absolutely fantastic. No problem pairing them. Audio and video sync is impeccable. The app that you can use to tweak the Sound is amazing. You can get any sound out of these buds however you want them. They are very loud if you want that also. They are perfect.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-20,Over powering bass kills these for me.,Some of the reviews were correct that changing to the more shallow bud does lessen the bass but not enough. It is super overbearing. If they could dial it back I would rate these up there with some of the better headphones i have used. As is I will use them as backups and try to replace the battery in my V-MODA Forza Metallo. Currently they are cheaper than these and as long as you dont have to have the truly wireless earbuds and are ok with the nerd necklace style headphones they sound Leagues better than these. The sound isn't even comparable. I had my current pair for over a year now the battery is only lasting 3 or 4 hours rather than the 8 or so they did originally so need to fix them if I can but those VModas sound so much better.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-20,Great!!!,Works so well. Highly recommend them.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-20,All good,All good
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-21,Nice portable headphones,"Super portable, sound great noise cancelings not the best, but in their defense I am used to the noise canceling of the Sony WH-1000X m3"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-21,Good for music bad for phone calls,The noise cancellation make it hard to have decent phone calls the person on the other side can’t hear me
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-21,Sound is amazing,Listening music
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-21,The best True Wireless Headphones on the market !,"Dont let the perceived size fool you, once you put these in your ear you will not want another pair of headphones. Paired with the app for your mobile device these things tick every box. Watch all the youtube videos you want read all the reviews you want Im telling you these are it!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-21,"Incredible quality, sound and price",For the price these have Incredible Sound and are comfortable for long hours of music or watching movies highly recommend for almost anyone
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-21,Amazing!,I really like them. Amazing!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-22,For the money the best headphones I’ve ever had,I love. Them. So. Much. More then my Bose
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-22,Awesome! No buzz or hiss.,"Sounds awesome with excellent bass and sound reproduction. These buds fit well and do not feel like they are about to fall out of my ears. I like the function of choosing one of the sound engineers personal eq setting. I have not had an issue with any hum. I love these buds, they have sound that is almost as good if not equal to my Beats Studio 3 over ear headphones. Batteries haven’t gone dead on me yet, these bad boys last a while on a charge. These are excellent ear buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-22,Best truly wireless earbuds for the money,Battery life is amazing
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-22,Great purchase! No regrets at all!,"I wish they had noise cancellation but, the suction is enough to block out sound. I always say these are the best things I've ever bought. I get more compliments on the case than anything else I carry."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-23,"I'm spoiled, but this sound doesn't quite do it for me. (Update) Found an EQ that fixes this","I'm probably just spoiled by over the ear Sony WH family of headphones, but not very impressed with these off the bat. Build quality is great, packaging A+, instructions and ease of use are great, but as soon as I started listening to songs I know and love I was disappointed. Like many others the ""hiss"" is super prevelent and a deal breaker for me. I did the firmware update, but couldn't hear a difference. I also tried the Hear-id equalizer and couldn't tell an improvement. When the sound is playing it hard to notice, but very annoying when you're between songs or paused. (Update) I found an EQ preset called ""Small Speaker"" that is leaps and bounds ahead of the other options and really delivers the sound I was hoping for! Adding a star back for that, but leaving one off for the hissing sound."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-24,Great bass and highs,The sound quality is great..
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-25,Fantastic Earbuds,"I was looking for true wireless earbuds under the $200 price point for gym use. The Liberty 2 Pro's have turned out to be fantastic headphones. The sound quality is remarkable for the price point. Punchy lows and crisp high's with ability to change the EQ. The fit is fantastic and I've never had the earbuds fall out even when running or lifting. I am not one to always write a review but the quality for the price point compelled me to leave a review. Additionally, I love that these support wireless charging. I workout 5 days a week and only need to charge them once every 3-4 weeks. I'd highly recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-25,sound quality is good,"Been looking for these after seeing a bunch of reviews on youtube. Amazon and Anker didn't ship these to where I live until recently. Sound quality is really good, the only problem i had was trying to keep it from falling out of one of my ear. I was worried about making calls with these, but seems that callers can hear me fine indoors and outdoors."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-25,Love it!,"First off, sound quality is amazing. No static, very clear for people to understand you one the phone. They have no idea you are using earbuds. Battery life was great as I was able to listen to music for quite a while before having to charge it. Lots of replacement parts were included and it fits your ear perfectly without becoming uncomfortable which was a huge plus for me."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-25,Good,Im like..use is one of one..
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-03-26,Does Not Charge | Low Battery | Decent Sound Quality,"I'm quite disappointed in these. Just after a few months of use, the right ear bud just somtimes completely refuses to charge. The few times that it does charge, it dies many times faster than the left ear bud. The sound quality is fine for my needs (just watching videos), but the battery quality is definitely not good."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-27,AMAZING,Bought these fro my wife for her birthday and these are the best wireless headphones she has ever had. Great value for the price.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-27,"The reviews are correct, excellent earphones",As usual excellent quality
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-28,Stop following trends and LISTEN to the best on the market!,"As an audiophile, these earbuds are amazing. Because I'm getting a bit older, these earbuds are phenomenal! The fact that you can customize the sound specifically to your hearing frequency is incredible. Staight up AirPod killers. Don't follow the crowd- get better. For high quality audio, look no further and look down at the rest of the the sheep blindly following the trends... Your ears.will thank you!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-28,They sound awesome!,"I've had these for a few months now and still love them. I tried and returned 4 of the other leading Anker models to make sure it was worth spending a bit more for these. It definitely was. These have a far better bass response and equalization control. Crisp highs, deep lows and solid for everything in between. And they're very comfortable for extended use. I had fun playing with the many EQ options through the Soundcore app, and they make a big difference, but now I've just been using 1 of the settings I really liked for months. They sound great! They have good passive noise cancellation and fit and stay in very well during regular activity. Haven't tried working out or running... in general, but that's a whole other story. ;)
Battery life is very good. I don't think they're lasting for 8 full hours of continuous use, but they're definitely good for quite a few episodes and then the recharge is pretty quick. The case seems to hold its charge quite well. I only plug it in once or twice a week at most."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-28,"Amazing bass, little discomfort","They sound amazing, nice deep bass. One thing I don't like is after awhile they hurt the inside of my ears."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-28,Very Impressive,"I have owned these little beauties for just under a month. The first thing I noticed is the fabulous sound they produce for all kinds of music. Between the EQ thru the Soundcore App and my Samsung phone audio settings, the Liberty 2 Pros produce a very balanced, full sound with plenty of low/bass response (to me anyway). You cant link them to multiple devices simultaneously, but it is easy enough to switch from phone to laptop, etc. I have had no problems charging them whether using a wireless charger or the included usb charger cable. The charge lasts too. I havent used it on a phone call yet but I have used it to speak to friends on Skype and paired for listening to streaming content. No troubles there. Bottom line, for the price point, they punch way above their weight class for sound quality and can get plenty loud. Solid build quality and the charging case is also well made and has a very cool design. I highly recommend this product."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-28,Amazing sound at an astonishing price!,"I have many different headphones and earbuds. From Apple to Sony to Sennheiser. I was pretty blown away with these considering their lower price. First, the fit. Very comfortable and they say in place. With six different ear cushions and different placement pieces it would be very difficult not to get these to fit your ear. Second, connecting to the iPhone isn’t very hard. First time for any Bluetooth is always a bit more of a step than the second time. These were pretty easy. I connected them to both my iPhone and MacBook within a minute. Third, and most important, sound. The sound stage is wide. The Soundcore app is very simple and gives you what you want. Many presets to choose from, including their Grammy award winning sound engineers. Sound preferences are subjective and with the wide range, you get the capability to set to your liking. I recommend listening to so some Sinatra, Dean Martin. Thin switch over to some Metallica, Shinedown, and The Cult. Seriously as you will hear the wide sound stage and all the instruments as intended. Fourth, charging. The case is perfect. Size and the iq charging is awesome. Pay 12-20 bucks and get another Anker iq charger. They battery life is amazing. Both for the case and the earbuds. Almost 40 hours for the case. Solid eight hours on the buds. Fourth, fexibility. I use these to listen to music and talk on the phone. These are definitely geared more towards listening to music as they don’t really have active noise cancelling rather noise isolation. So, you don’t really hear anything in your ear but when you are talking on the phone you don’t have the same benefit of ambient noise being filtered out as much. Still good but not the best. People can hear me fine but they say their is some hollowness. Finally, price. I’m amassed these aren’t going for $300+. At half the price you won’t be disappointed for sure. Enjoy!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-30,Great earbuds,Works great with my Samsung Galaxy s10e.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-30,Good sound,"I like the sound, it has very good base and so far, 2 &1/2 months in, the batteries last several hours."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-30,Wow! Probably will sell my Sennheisers now!,"Great In-Ear buds for Music! The sound quality gets you moving and the Bass really keeps you moving! Sounds good for podcasts, clear on phone calls and works great for business calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-30,Couldn't live up to the hype,"The main reason I bought these earbuds was to listen to music throughout the day while at work and to be able to take calls handsfree. This product excels at those two things. I mainly use just one earbud at a time. The battery life is outstanding. The sound quality while in a call is excellent and, according to some of the people I talk to, the quality is excellent on their end too. They're relatively comfortable but after a couple of hours they get painful so I just switch ears. Where this product fails at is volume. The volume level is so low when paired with my Note 8. I'm not sure if anybody else experienced this but the volume is absurdly low to the point where I'm hearing outside noise. And these things aren't noise canceling at all. These earbuds aren't worth the price in my opinion."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-30,These are freaking awesome.,Really great headphones for the price. Beats bose and sennheiser momentums. Nothing really to complain about. Great for riding.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-31,They're a go!!!!!,"By far my favorite earbuds! I've owned JBL's,BOSE & and many of lesser cost. Best value for your money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-01,Recommend to buy it asap,Best quality of sound in budget price!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-01,Easy to use. Tons of features. Amazing quality.,A friend introduced me to Anker two summers ago and I've really liked the brand since then. I picked these up because my cat chewed on the wires of my OnePlus headphones. Holy cow these are good. Sounds quality is incredible. Basically noise cancelling fitment. You can adjust the EQ to your liking and 8 hours of play back + 3 charges from the carrying case. Wireless charging and they're not bulky like other truly wireless headphones. Very easy to setup and lots of functionality with the buttons. Insane!! 10/10.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-01,They're worth it,Great sound and battery life. The price good to.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-05,Great Headphones,Very light. Long battery life. Good sound quality
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-04-06,"Hissing Noise, Uncomfortable, Ear aches, pressure sensation & Too much Treble",Hissing noise. Not comfortable. Case & headphones heat up considerably during wireless charging.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-04-06,"Everything amazing except for one thing, left bud looses connection","after my AirPods went out after a couple years I told myself I'm not buying AirPods again cause you can't replace the components yourself. even though the same goes for this at least I was able to get the warranty for it, so I figured it was ok. I literally bought 7 wireless speakers before finding these which I loved and still do. The base is amazing, sounds is LOUD which I love. The only crappy thing is that the left bud will not always but frequent enough lose connectivity, I thought maybe it was a lemon so I bought another, same issue left bud after a month or two just started losing connection. did the factory reset, and all the troubleshooting to get it back up and it works but than shortly enough maybe a week or 2 even gotta go through it again. its a shame cause otherwise the product is amazing but in comparison to the AirPods which both my wife and I had, we never not once had them lose connection in the two years."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-07,Great unless the wind blows.,"Well they're great for music but they're basically unusable for calls if the wind is blowing at all. I know they're not advertised as noise canceling but in a 2mph the phone is completely useless. However, I love the sound quality for music and they fit fine and are comfortable. I also like the design of the charge case."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-07,"Amazing Sound quality, good battery life and great customer support!","Like to start by saying these headphones sound amazing!! Definitely top 5 for audio quality with the specialty designed speaker set up! And the app lets you set the EQ just right. Just people I work with I've sold 6 pairs for you guys! Once people listen to them for a minute or two they go and buy a pair! I did have a problem with the right side not lasting as long as it should battery wise. Even if I would switch sides to change the master bluetooth side, as both can be used as the Master side. The Master side naturally will consume more energy leading to the battery not lasting as long. Well if you switch throughout the day you get more listen time because it splits the time one bud is being the master. Anyway. After about 2-3 months My right bud was not lasting nearly 8hrs no matter what volume I listen to music at. Soundcore/Anker sent me a replacement pair without to many questions! The replacement pair so far last about 7-7½ hours of consistent music at 30% to 40% volume. I'm totally fine with that! I wear them 8hrs a day 5 days a week and absolutely zero ear fatigue. They are very light and comfortable in your ears. All the options of different style ear wings and multiple style of actual bud sizes. Find the right set up for your ear and you will forget you have them in after an 8 hour shift at work! I'd like to thank Sunny from Anker for being so understanding and quick with my replacements! I'd recommend Anker or Soundcore products to anyone looking for quality that's not expensive! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-04-07,Mixed bag,"When music is playing, the sound is amazing. And the app is constantly updating and offering new features, like a custom EQ rather than presets or the HearID. But when no music is playing, or you're listening to a podcast or audiobook, there's a noticeable buzz. They've quieted the buzz down with updates, but it's still there. And the 8 hour battery life? That's for the bud that's paired to the master bud. The one that connects to the phone gets you maybe 5 hours. And a half hour before that, you get a nice loud ""BATTERY LOW"" notification. Time to drop that bud in the case and recharge for 20 minutes. I might get the Galaxy Buds+ for that reason alone, though they don't sound as good. When music is playing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-04-08,too expensive they broke,they broke
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-10,Really good but a touch over priced for the quirks.,"Pros: they sound really good and no one has yet to complain about hearing/ understanding me on a call. Cons: The big one is that the earphones have some strange connection issue when on calls. If I am using both when I receive a call then the left bud will begin to cut in and out. The solution is to just put one back in the case. Other than that while the sound is in general very good and richer than the pair of Bowmake Sifi's I have. The bass isn't quite as ""THERE"" as everyone else makes it seem like it is. But for what they are I suppose that that is more of a nit pick. I personally think that they should be a solid 30 bucks cheaper based on those cons though. Other than that they're great so far. So far..."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-04-10,Great sound. If your ear buds don't have APTx don't bother.,If you pay for high quality steaming this is the best value true wireless option that doesn't lose it in the Bluetooth transmission.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-11,"Nice product, but didn't fit ME...","The earbuds sounded great. I say sounded because I unfortunately had to return them due to the size of them being incompatible with my ears. Again, I like the quality of the unit and the details expressed in the music played. Nice sound stage. The app is a nice complementary feature for tailoring the sound to your special tastes. The other minor thing was the individual earbuds' batteries drained differently(one faster than the other). I'll keep my ear to the track, listening and waiting for a more compact package that suits my particular taste. Thanks and have a Good day!! !"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-11,If you like a very clear sound with deep bass.,These are some of the best sounding earbuds. I have ever owned. The soundstage is wide and incredible depth. Even with heavy bass an acoustic guitar still sounds like it in the room with you. I own the Sony WH-1000xm3 headphones and these are easily comparable. I highly recommend these to anyone. Some youtube reviewers mention a hiss. I have not heard it On these at All. Anker really impressed me with these.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-04-13,Quality sound but poor fit,"Sound quality was great but I could not get the left earpiece to stay in my ear, no matter what combination of tip and wing I used. Tried to run with them and had to finally remove the left earpiece and put it in my pocket. The right one was fine."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-14,Great great sound,These absolutely sound fantastic for True Wireless Sound. The highs and mids are detailed and the bass is off the charts (Electronic setting).
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-14,Great ear buds,These little buds sound great. I had Bose before and they fell apart. These sound better than those.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-04-15,Very good,Best out there. You can adjust them to you own hearing condition. After you do that they cannot be beat.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-15,Hit the nail on the head for sound quality.,"The Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro have met or exceeded my expectations in most categories. I was worried about the fit of the earbuds but with all the included tips and fins I have no problem with these fitting comfortably in my ears. Yes, it took some trial and error to get the right size, but once these are seated properly in your ear the sound becomes clearer. The sound quality is amazing and it helps that there is an included EQ which helps you really tune in the perfect balance. Speaking of perfect balance, the hear ID gives you a personalized listening experience based on how your ears perceive different tones. I found this to work the best for my listening experience, but they do have a lot of presets that you can try out. The highs sound pronounced and clear while the lows stay true and will provide heavy and full bass I am hearing lots of people bring up the white noise aspect to the earbuds, I can say that it is faint and is present when you have the music extremely low. I cannot comment on audiobooks or podcasts as I have been using these mostly at the gym and for work and never hear it
These earbuds have been put through the test, in terms of staying in my ears, and they have passed. I have used these on long distance runs, climbing stairs, weigh training, and more, and I have yet to dislodge them based solely on activity alone. They have held up to sweat, and some medium rain and are still functioning properly. I did have to reach out to their customer service in regards to my first pair I received. Let me tell you that their customer service is hands down top tier in all aspects. They were patient with myself in trying to diagnose a problem that I was having. They finally sent me a new pair, free of charge, and that had addressed the issue. Thank you to everyone I had spoken with along the way and offered their help. Customer service is an integral part to making sure we, the users, have people who will actively work and address our needs, so thank you. I spent a great deal of time researching truly wireless earbuds, and I am very happy with my choice. The sound is very clear and the sound stage for the instruments is very accurate. I can say with confidence that I have been recommending these and know that this company is on the right track for future success. If you have any doubts about these, I urge you to buy these and if you do not like them, return them. You will never know what you are missing until you decide to take that first step. Since this is a review based on the product itself I have given it 4 stars to appropriately reflect very minor issues. Outside of the minor issues, I am impressed with these earbuds as well as their stellar customer service. I look forward to trying out their future products."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-15,Amazing sound quality in a wireless design.,"The sound quality is better than any wired earphones I’ve owned. Better yet, the HearID functionality creates sound tailored to you. These are amazing."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-15,Living up to the hype,"Wow!! I was worries about some of the reviews of a hissing sound but took the chance in buying them. Glad I did. There was a firmware update I performed as soon as I received them, so that could have fixed any issues. The application (Soundcore) is a must. There is a ton of presets EQ's (genre types & even the 10 grammy winning producers have their presets, and the Hear ID). I go back and forth between the customized Hear ID and the Hip-Hop setting. Sound is amazing, my only complaint is the ear tips. Don't get me wrong, their fine and just as good if not better than anything I have had before. I just ordered some comply memory foam eartips. Got these on dale for $130, and even at $150, it's a go. What u waiting for? ?"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-15,Best sound of em all.,"These are the best earbuds I've ever had. I also own beatz, havit G1, monster, and Jbl. I travel for work so they get alot of use. I recently lost my charging pod and Emily in customer service got me a replacement quickly. Pairing is quick and battery life is longer than advertised. But the sound is the most impressive feature."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-15,Pound for pound KINGS,"Absolutely amazing on bass boost. No “whirring”. So happy. Easily worth $200+
(Not sponsored honest review) Flossy Carter’s YouTube led me here"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-04-17,"Great sound that’s customizable, long battery life, no connectivity problems","I love, love, love these wireless earbuds! They have amazing sound that you can customize via the product app. They come in a compact, easy to store case with lots of replacements buds in various sizes. And the battery lasts forever. I was very impressed with the Soundcore app that essentially tests your hearing by playing tones across the scale (and you tap as you hear each tone) to determine what tones you hear better in which ear. Then, it customizes the equalizer so you can get the best sound experience. I think that that is genius, as our hearing abilities change as we age, and everyone is different. Or you can choose one of their equalizer settings. So you can basically listen to any kind of music (or podcast) without missing any of the effects. I’ve heard lyrics and riffs that I’ve never even noticed before while wearing these earbuds. I have never had any connectivity issues at all. As soon as I open the case and get them out, I’m connected to Bluetooth. And as soon as the case is closed, it disconnects. That’s great for people like me, who always forget to turn things off! And they have an unbelievably long battery life. One charge lasts me for a couple of weeks. I could not recommend these earbuds more highly. You will not be disappointed with your purchase!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-18,A Lot Better Than Expected!,"I searched/read/watched a lot of content trying to find the best overall quality (IMO) wireless ear buds. These are my first set of wireless earbuds. My main focus was sound quality and overall value for my money. Well I am glad I bought these for sure! One very important point that people dont mention enough is getting the CORRECT in ear fitting. And once I found the correct size for my weird ear size.....let me say I am COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY AT THE SOUND QUALITY!! The different option sizes that come with these was important to me. Like I said before, I am very happy with my purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-04-18,"Great headphone, horrible issue","I've read some reviewers saying these headphones had this issue with the white noise, but I also saw it wasn't every user, and the company said it affects only 1%, and these headphones looked to be so amazing otherwise. Well apparently I'm one of the ""1%"" (I think the percentage is higher), which sucks a lot. The headphones themselves are great, amazing battery life, and when listening to music (at least in my case), you can't hear the white noise and the sound quality is amazing. But that's the only thing I can do with them, any video, even scrolling on Facebook, the white noise drives you mad. Unless these headphones get a fix I cannot recommend them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,0,2020-04-18,Anker Soundcore is junk,The battery is junk. Does not last. Customer service is a joke.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-04-19,Crackling!,"At first, I was blown away by these headphones. Then, all of a sudden (second day owned) they started cracking and distorting. Very upsetting as they sounded great initially."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-19,Amazing sound and comfort!,Sound is amazing and very crisp. I was expecting a little more punch but the mids and highs sound very clear. The comfort is perfect out of the box for me but the included a great assortment of tips and wings to fit any ear size. Would recommend 100%!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-20,Meets all expectations,"Value far exceeds the price, it took me almost an hour to find the perfect fit by combining the assortment of buds and wings but once I did I forgot I was wearing them. Sound quality is very good, volume is a little less than I would have liked but I compensated by raising the bars on the EQ in the app.
No hiss and very good connectivity. Would buy again."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-20,Positively Positive,These are great. I hope you can catch them on sale.

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-04-20,Not worth the price,Another bad purchase
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-04-21,had to return malfunction,"AnkerDirect is wonderful to work with, had a problem with sound in one earbud, they sent the trouble shoot directions, which we complied with, than followed up with return label, and sent the replacement earbuds. They Emily did and amazing job helping us. Thank you so very much, my Grandson truly enjoys these earbuds, would highly recommend them to others. Thank you again for all your help. Sue"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-21,Best buds to buy for,These are worth 150$. I did not regret this purchase and the sound quality is amazing. Noise surpression is ok .
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-22,These are lighter then previous earbuds...,Makes it easier to answer calls while on the go.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-04-23,Sound amazing jsut not good for Phone calls / working,"when I first used them the left ear had a crackle and sound was bad, downloaded the app and updated them and all that went away. the sound quality is amazing, the fit very comfortable, haven't got hot in the ear. the buttons are small and out of the way. the down sides, when on the phone it picks up everything in the back ground and is super loud for the person your on the phone with my wife has to put her phone on speaker phone when I'm using them. there's also no pass threw sound. hopefully future updates will fix them. on the fence on returning them and getting a different brand."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-04-24,Great sound but terrible hardware,"It worked great for a month. But then the left earbud stopped outputting sound, and although the right earbud works it randomly pauses my music on Spotify and I have to manually start it up again. The sound quality was great when I used it but I shouldn't have to pay this much money for a product that quits working after a month. Wish I could get a refund."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-04-26,Defective battery in right earbud,"Loved these earbuds when I first got them although the hiss is quite loud. But after only owning them for a few months and minimal use, the right earbud has started going from full battery to dead in less than two hours. Not sure if I have the first or second hardware iteration but my pair is clearly defective."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-26,Great earbuds!,"These are fantastic, great packaging, large assortment of fitment accessories, USB type C charger, great sound, the app is really good... For the money these are super. Really like that you can use one at a time. Call quality is mehhh... Usable but not amazing. But I bought these to enjoy Netflix, YouTube and music on the various movie devices I have.... For that purpose they are great!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-26,Definitely worth every penny!,"I bought these for work because I wanted something compact and comfortable with a longer battery life between charges. I’m a heavy equipment operator so it’s always really loud at work and these help to block the noise, as well as the perk of good sound quality and customizable sound settings. I don’t usually have access to a charger so the quick recharge case and the long battery life make them a great buy. Definitely worth the money."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-04-26,"Supreme Sound Quality, Beats the Jabras!","Fair disclaimer: I purchased both these and the Jabra Elite Active 75t's. I had heard some good things said about this and its companion app. Overall, I'm glad say that I am impressed; I already own an older mouse from Anker, so I can attest to their craftsmanship, and these earbuds are no exception - they are top-notch quality. While I am no audiophile, I tested both buds extensively for over a week for their sound quality and comfort. Let me just save any suspense and say it flat out, the Liberty Pro 2's have better noticeable sound quality than the Jabra's (more on this below). Overall, these are also better buds than the Jabra's. However, I still decided to return these, mainly due to their prominent appearance (I wanted stealthier buds) and a harder time getting them to fit into my ears as well as fitting them back in the case; I still haven't decided what to do with the Jabra's, as they are still in their return window. Those minor gripes aside, these *would* be the best buds I have tried so far, hands down. Features the Jabra has that beat these buds:
+ More prominent looking case (this is somewhat subjective)
+ More easier side buttons to click (on the downside, it's easier to click them by mistake)
+ Better bass and a stronger, more ""complete"" sound profile (It's hard to describe unless you try it yourself; also, in my case the best sound was achieved after ""fixing"" EQ the settings in their Sound+ companion app)
+ Easier to fit them into your ears initially
+ Easier to fit them back in the case when you're done
Areas where these buds out-performed the Jabras:
+ Superior, more richer sound quality after fiddling around with EQ settings; I like that they offer EQ settings from grammy producers, in fact some of my favorites were Alex Pasco and Ignacio Molino's sound profiles for pure listening bliss. + Their companion app Soundcore, has a much better look and more options for sound profiles than the Jabra's app
+ Lot of options for bud sizes, so I was able to find a better fit in my ear than was possible for me with the Jabra's
+ Mic quality appears to be clearer and overall better than with the Jabra's (if that's something important to you)
+ Side buttons are more difficult to press, but it's also much harder to achieve ""accidental"" clicks
+ Their case can be considered to look sleeker and also ""cooler"" to some (again, this is a subjective point)
Overall, this is mostly a toss up unless you have specific features you're looking for that one or the other buds provides for you. The Jabras are more well-rounded in some areas such as a generally stable sound profile (the downside being that you might need to fiddle around with their EQ settings before getting the best sound) as well as an easier fit initially; they also have a sleeker appearance and looks nicer and more well hidden, in my opinion. The Liberty 2 Pro's achieve a richer and more satisfying sound profile for audiophiles, as well as more settings for sound profiles; they also have better mic quality, and lots of bud choices for the best fit (I actually got a bit overwhelmed that they were nice enough to provide so many bud sizes). In the end, I chose to return these buds mainly since I don't use the mic; and unfortunately their bulkier, less stealthier size seems also designed for their mic quality, though I tend to prefer buds with a smaller footprint in general. Their sound is some of the best I have heard, though in truth I haven't tried a lot of earbuds and am no audiophile myself. So far I own the following buds: SoundPEATS True Wireless Earbuds, Jabra Elite Active 75t, and Liberty Pro 2 Buds (these). Sound-wise, for me it goes like Liberty Pro > Jabra > Soundpeats. Overall, I preferred the appearance and the ease of use of the Jabra's and that's ultimately why I returned these buds. --
Rating:
Sound Quality - 4 stars (Improved via EQ settings, noticeable hissing on some songs like on C's and S's)
Noise Cancellation - 5 stars (what more can you ask?) Battery Life - 5 stars (So far, I can't complain)
Overall - 4 stars"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-27,"Front row sound, excellent bass",These are worth the extra cost. They sound absolutely fantastic! Great bass. And you get to calibrate each earphone based on how you hear from each ear. I've never seen anything like this before. OMG!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-27,One of the best pairs of earbuds I have used.,"These are some of the best headphones i have ever owned. There right up there with the big brands like Sony, Bose, etc. The sound quality is amazing, they are comfortable, the case isn't too big. The app has a good layout. The pairing process is painless and they auto connect out of the case and disconnect when put back in. The battery life is amazing, I'm able to use them for at least 6 house between charges and regularly reaching that advertised 8 hour rating and sometimes longer. Overall, I highly reccomend these."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,1,1,2020-04-27,Product Stopped Working,I have only had this product for four months and it stopped pairing with my phone.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-28,Best quality for the price,"I will preface this review with fitment. If you dont take the time to get the correct ear tips and wings on this these will be a bad experience for you. Onto the review, these earbuds are really the best. I looked at tons of YouTube videos and web pages to see who made the best earbuds. These have the best sound. The bass is punchy but will not overtake the treble yet the mids are still noticeable. I have heard sounds I have not heard before. That is how good these are. I'm not sure about what people are saying about the ""hiss"" or static but I have yet to encounter that issue. I guess from everything I have seen and heard it depends on your set. These have changed the way I listen to music. The call quality is solid too. The noise cancelling is effective for me. I have worn this while it was windy and had to do spur of the moment things in noisy environments and these seem to hold up well. Every call recieved or sent has been clear. I asked people how the call is to make sure of it. The soundcore app works great too. Though this is necessary it definitely adds to the experience. I really like the Hear ID. It creates a unique sound profile based off how well hear tones. It's like going to get the ear doctor where you push a button when hear a beep. There numerous other eq profiles you can choose from too, or you can make your own. You can choose what the answer/end button does with the app. I like how the button Is on the top so you dont feel like your jamming earbuds further in your ear when you press it. Dont expect these to be like the 400$ earbuds out there. These are great alternatives for the apple airpods and the galaxy buds. These do exactly as they described. If you want ambient mode look elsewhere. If you are looking for water resistance buy the soundcore LP2. They have a higher IPX rating for rain. These are just sweat proof. Of course these are geared towards the audiophile not a construction worker. If you workout you will be fine. They definitely stay in your ear well too which really nice even if you headbang or dance around. If you have a seizure I'm pretty sure these will stay on. The battery life is great too, both the earbuds and charging case. The nice thing is with these is if you turn off your bluetooth the earbuds will shut off automatically after I think 5 or 10 minutes to save battery life. I almost forgot, as far as any audio lag goes I have not noticed any lag with YouTube. I don't do lengthy reviews but I feel these are worthy of one"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-01-31,Sound compares to concert/live performance quality at the right price.,"I have to say that these are the first bluetooth earbuds that I've bought. For the price, the sound is hands down comparable to earbuds or over the ear headsets that are in a higher price range($200+). Crystal clear audio for all highs, mids and lows and I listen to a variety of music ranging from dance to country. I haven't had any audio delay when watching my shows. I use hulu, netflix, youtube, and CW. I also use spotify without any audio issues. Call quality isn't the best I've ever used but it's still super clear on both ends. With the right tips and wing tips you get some decent passive noise cancelation compared to other headsets I've used. Note that I've also not encountered the hissing people were mentioning. For the Hear ID feature, I might be doing the calibration incorrectly but after calibration the overall sound seemed lower than if I were to use either the presets or a custom EQ setting. I can walk almost completely anywhere in the house sized around 1550sqft without having connection issues. Starts to break up from 1 corner of the house to the other end. + and - are out of a 5 rating down below for me. Pros:
+++++ Audio quality
++++ Build quality
+++ Call quality
+++ soundcore app compatible
++ customizable EQ settings via the app
++++ Battery life
Cons:
- - the soundcore app doesn't let me customize the buttons for volume control for single press. They only allow me to customize the double tab or hold and press settings. - there's a crackling sound every time I adjust the EQ settings but note that this was resolved after the firmware update. - - when battery life hits below 40%, the bluetooth connection may start to have some issues. This annoyed me as 40% (2 bars on the app) should be more than enough to have a stable connection even if I walk a waa day from my phone for a little bit. - the ear tips that came installed seemed like an extra pair of the Small size ones but seemed like they weren't shaped properly like if they were used even though the set was brand new. Side note. If you have to re-pair your heasset(earbuds) again, make sure you adjust the volume first before putting them back on as it seems like the volume will default back to 100%. I also picked the white/silver version so that they are generally easier to find. Paid $120 for these since I missed out on the $110 sale but worth the money if you can afford it. Definitely worth the purchase for people that want balance sound range in a wireless setup."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-02-03,Best earbuds EVER (if you can fix the hiss),"These blow any earbuds out of the water!!! The personalized EQ for each ear is AMAZING! The depth of all the frequencies is so clear and crisp I was honestly blown out of the water. These are the first ear buds (NOT over the ear headphones) that can actually handle to the low frequency of ""Bass I Love You"" I use that ""song"" to see how low I can get the frequency before it cuts out. Let me tell you...it hits EVERY frequency! To the point where at higher volumes it can actually disorient you! These really are amazing. Now for the CON and it's a big one! The hiss....make it stop....PLEASE!!!! It does not hiss when there is no sound playing so that's a plus. But as soon as you start using the ear buds...hissssssssss. last for about 2-3 seconds before any sound starts coming out. And at VERY low volume its present in the background. You've got the sound! Its amazing!! It's nipping at the heels of ACTUAL studio quality sound. Just stop the hiss and you've got the best wireless set EVER!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-07,Great Bluetooth headphones,"These are great in just about every way. A ton of gel/wing options to get the right fit. Great sound. Very good if you use these for phone calls. The only thing I wish for is connectivity to two devices at once, but it is minor."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-09,3rd times the charm,"I had to order 3 of these. The 1st one was not delivered to my address but Amazon resolved that by refunding me. I ordered my 2nd one and it was delivered correctly to my address. It worked fine out the the box until the firmware update which did not take on those ones, so I returned those. Ordered a 3rd replacement set and they work! Updated fine and I enjoy the sound. I'm not going to knock off points for volume because I enjoy overwhelming volume when I am at the gym. Final notes: if your earbuds don't update, you'll need a replacement set because the troubleshooting doesn't fix a set of duds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-13,Good sounding earbuds with long battery life.,"This is my third pair of Bluetooth Wireless earbuds. I find they are very good for a medium-priced earphone. I like Anker products and see them as one of the better-made tier 2 companies. Their cables, chargers and peripherals have always been good; and now they are doing a great job with higher-end products. These earbuds have a lot going for them. The case acts as a charger to recharge the buds. They claim 8 hours – I listened for two and felt there was a lot of juice left. The case will recharge them twice. The case runs off a USB C cable or a Qi charger. I charged wirelessly and it worked as promised. The main reason you spend this kind of money on earbuds is to get a great sound. Compared to the Sony SP700N they sound great. I was not happy with the Sony – they were thin sounding and lacked bass and warmth. I also didn’t like the fact that there were several Sony apps necessary to make everything work. I want it all in one app. In this case, the Anker did it all in one app had lot of options to shape the sound and were far superior sounding. The other pair I tested these against were the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay E8 2.0 which were a bit more expensive. They also have capacitive charging available for the case as well as USB C. They held a charge well and could also recharge three times before depleting. Frankly, these were the best sounding earbuds of my whole collection – either earbuds or over-the-ear and regardless of price point; the B&O just sound better! However, that being said, there is a lot to like with these well-made, good quality sounding products. The bass in the Anker is a little more pronounced – maybe even exaggerated. You can adjust them with a pretty good little app, to adjust the sound to fit your preferences. Usually bass suffers the most in this type of earphone – the location is critical to how good it sounds. With these I had a bit of trouble finding the right cushion, but once I did they sounded pretty good (and thee are a LOT of extra inserts to make it easy to find the most comfortable ones. These bud are not quite as “refined” as the B&O, but were far better than average. I also liked the mechanical switch and buttons instead of the touch-sensitive pad on the B&Os. Much harder to accidentally turn off or mis-adjust the music. If you are into total accuracy, you may want to spend the additional $$$ for the B&O, but for a good solid musical experience, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 earphones will do well. I did see several review speak to background noise or static. I never experienced anything like that."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,2,1,2020-02-14,Don’t Pair with Multiple Devices,"The Ankers are impossible to pair with multiple devices. I spent more time pairing and repairing the earbuds than listening to music and videos. It was maddening. This is a shame because the sound was great. My other complaint is that the charging case is very big. I returned the Anker earbuds, opting for the Jabra 65t. Our family has three pairs in the house (one for each person). Now that the 75t is out, the 65t are the old model. You can buy these top-rated earbuds for $50 less than the Ankers, and they easily pair with multiple devices, have hear-through for running and talking on the phone, and a much smaller case. Furthermore, I think that controlling playback, volume, and interacting with Siri is easier with the Jabras. I attached a picture of the Ankers above in white and the Jabra 65t below."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-14,Without a doubt these are worth every penny.,"Got the Pro2's for Christmas and they sounded great. However there was a hissing sound to which I contacted customer service explaining the issue. Emily of customer support found that the unit that I got was part of a small percentage of defective Pro 2's. Emily said Soundcore would provide a replacement and was super helpful is exchanging process for an updated pair. Got them a few days later and they sound awesome! I purchased the top of the line earphones from a company that has a ""fruit"" for its logo and in my personal opinion the Pro 2's are far better in sound quality, in being comfortable in the ear for extended periods of time and...the price. The set up is easy and there is a cool feature that creates the perfect sound experience based on the design of your ears. The ear wings the are included make these earbuds fit snug in the ear without any pressure on the ear. They help the Pro's stay put and keep the sound in. Multiple ear tip pieces and wing are provided for pretty much any style of ears. As for the sound, perfect for classical, rock, bluegrass pretty much any genre that you can think of. Clarity of the cymbals and woodwinds are amazing. Cellos, sound like cellos and six strings, sound like a six string. Bass is tight and not overwhelming and mid range is just right. I'm not an audiophile by any means but I love listening to music and without a doubt these are worth every penny so bought another pair for office work!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-15,The Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro - They are Amazing! - Hands Down The Best Ever! I Love Them!,"The Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro maybe the best True Wireless Earbuds ever. Did I say I love them? My first time trying to figure out the packaging was a bit of a challenge, but I finally figured it out. This left me with doubting these earbuds would be any good. It is like they told the packaging engineer money was no object and to make the package into the best they could do. This is my only complaint. The packaging is WAY over board. Now for the storage case and the earbuds, this is way cool. The case has a slide top that turns the earbud on and allow you to connect by way of Bluetooth. It even charges the earbud when they are in the case. If you are like me with large hands and big fingers, the earbud jump into their place, held by magnetic making it easy to remove or replace them in the storage case. Very nice! The outside of the case has three status LEDs to show the battery state. Also a small button for checking the status or to command a Bluetooth pairing. Okay, the first time (I was in a hurry to try them) placed these in my ears and played music I was NOT impressed. I was ready to contact the support. Digging into the papers I found that they have an app. I downloaded the app and found it clear and easy to understand. WOW! The app, using the earbuds gives you a hearing test and customizes the earbuds for your personal hearing! How cool is that? Once I completed this I replayed the same song I first played before the custom audio curve and was blown away! Wow! These things are fantastic. As far as using them with a phone call, the other end tells me they hear me really well. Better than using the stock phone's microphone. The audio from the phone into the earbuds in excellent! Did I say I love these? Battery life is great. 4 hours of bicycle riding and they are still going strong. All in all these earbuds by Anker Soundcore would be a 10 star, but Amazon only allows a maximum of 5, so 5 it is!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-17,Terrific sound that is customizeable,"These are super sounding earbuds. The set is complete with different size earbud adapters for optimum fit. They have a unique twist and lock design for a secure and sound sealed fit into your ear canal. They are very comfortable, and I can use them for long periods without discomfort. The earbuds each have push buttons for controlling your music and other features. The buttons are customizeable through the Soundcore App.
Unpacking the set requires inserting the earbuds into the charging case. I let them charge overnight. First time removing them from the charging case starts the pairing process. Open the Bluetooth settings on your device and pair them. Super easy. Next, install the SoundCore App on your device and start the App. Select the earbuds and check for a Firmware update. Once completed, you are ready to rock. The SoundCore App allows you to completly customize your sound with presets, or using the equalizer to make your own sound preset. You can also customize the button functions. Inserting the earbuds is easy. Just insert and twist the a quarter turn to the rear and they are set. The sound is amazing. I used the ""Signature SoundCore"" preset, as I like the sound best. It is a full rich sound with a super bass response. I tried the Bass Boost preset setting, and searched for Bass Test music. The bass response is just the best. The sound is great for music, video streaming and phone calls. The video streaming sounds great. Watching a movie gives you a full immersive sound that rivals any stereo system. You get 8 long hours of play with the ability to completely recharge them 3 times with the charging case. Best of all, you can place them in the charging case for 10 minutes and get 2 hours of playback time. These are great for use in airplanes. You can get over 24 hours of playtime with the charging case, and the 10 minute quick charge makes them perfect for travelling. In my opinion, these are audiophile quality at an affordable price. These are a terrific bargain for the quality and sound they deliver. This set is a super value, and they get and deserve every bit of the 5 stars I give them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-17,Great quality! Amazing feel!,"UPDATE: I got new earwings and they are extremely comfortable! Best fitting and quality headphones I've ever used!! Great interface and sound. The ear wings are effective but super tight to swap out. One of the size I need ripped pulling it over the hold peg, so it feels weird but the other one is very comfortable."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-18,Best Wireless Earbuds,I have been looking for a wireless earbuds and found the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro is the best one so far. Music sounded great and Voice calling is even clearer than talking through the phone. I love the programmable controls and SW update capability. New bug fixes and features can be added in the future.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-02-18,"Fantastic for listening, not so great for conferencing","I bought these with hopes that they could displace my Plantronics Voyager bluetooth headset since it doesn't support AptX with my Mac and so it won't coexist with a bluetooth mouse. These earbuds do support AptX, don't have a problem with a mouse, and sound absolutely incredible - seriously I think they sound better than my Sennheiser cans. I mean the sound quality blows me away. Unfortunately when I'm on conference calls people say I sound fine and then later tell me I'm breaking up or cutting out when I haven't moved or changed position (I'm still within 4 feet of my Mac), and that's just not going to cut it. I guess I'm going to keep them for listening to music but I'm really disappointed that they're not reliable for calls."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-18,Great for wearing at work,"I am not an audiophile. So for me, it comes down to fit and function. In those regards, these are a very nice set of ear buds. I usually prefer my sony earmuffs, but these are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Again, I'm not a purist, so to me, the audio sounds great. There was no issue pairing with my phone, tablet or the bluetooth transmitter attached to my workstation. Charging is quick. There's more than enough charge to last my day at work. Being able to wirelessly charge is a huge plus. These are a big step up from previous ear buds that I've had. I think these will be used for along time to come."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-18,difficult to use but great sound,these are difficult to use. i can't seem to get them to both work at the same time. but when they do work they sound better than bose and beats!
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,Fan-frickin-tastic audio quality to my ears!,"These things sound fantastic. Audio quality is amazing. I listen to a lot of rock and blues and just amazed at how good these ""tic tacs"" in your ears sound. Voice quality is good for calls. Everyone has different shaped ears, but they fit me out of the box. I just switched from 10 years an Apple iPhone user to Pixel. These things sound way better than AirPods (of course I can only relate to the originals as I never upgraded those). I have a set of Sennheiser (don't recall the model) and Audio-Technica ATH-M50x's over the ear cans and I would put these in that class. Now the niggles... they are not noise cancelling and I did not want them to be... but they kinda shut out all noise around you. Wish they had mics that could let you hear better around you. I suspect that would draw on the battery life, but I think it would be worth it as these things have pretty good battery life. Also, I am not able to get these to pair with multiple devices for some reason. Would be nice if they did."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-02-19,So far I'm loving these ear buds,"I got these ear buds to alternate with headphones, especially in the gym. So far, I love them. They come in a magnetic case that also acts as a charging station. It also makes it easy to pair for the first time. Simply open the charging station slide and let your phone look for Soundcore. There is also an app that allows you choose different sound options to your choosing. The buds have buttons that allow you to pause songs or skip ahead, depending on if you press once or twice. Package also comes with several different sizes to help lock them in place in your ear. Sound is great, especially when I set my own acoustic choice in the app, which you can save. Happy with this choice so far but only had them a week. We'll see how the battery holds up."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-22,"These are incredible. My favorite true wireless earbuds, hands-down. Fantastic sound.","I think I finally found what I was searching for with these Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds. I listen to a lot of dance, EDM, stuff with treble and bass, and a wide variety of other music. I own a ton of earbuds, both expensive and inexpensive - but never could settle on a favorite as an ""end-all, be-all"" of favs. I think these may just be IT for now. Most, if not all, wireless ear buds have the issue of wanting to fall out of my ears during movement, dancing around (horribly...I'm a HORRIBLE dancer), and working out in them - either that, or I can get them to stay in, but they become really uncomfortable really fast. The few that were actually comfortable and didn't fall out...they were OK, but the sound quality wasn't my fav. And so on and so forth. First off, I downloaded their Soundcore App onto my iPhone, and updated the firmware. I'm not sure if there were significant updates to these or not, but it looked like it took a little time getting everything up to speed. Their app gives you a ton more flexibility in terms of control and what kind of sound you are wanting from them - and there's a LOT of different selections to choose from (or you can customize your own). So don't skip that app - you're missing out on what these things can really do, if you do. Pairing was ridiculously easy. I'm used to most of these types of earbuds to be a little tricky at the onset with pairing with each other first before pairing to my devices, but these did it so quickly and easily that I was extremely surprised. I love the style and design of the charging/storage case these come with - it's my favorite of all time, thus far. It's kind of oval shaped (which is like a lot of these kinds), but the top slides open in a way I like better than others. It has a soft, matte, suede-ish feel on the outside of them that I really like, too. The earbuds fall magnetically into them and it charges them very quickly and easily. The sound quality of these are as good or better than my favorite over-the-ear Sony's - and similar to those, you can use the app to customize your sound, and it's deep and rich, IMO. I've gotten ear buds that were twice the price of these and nowhere near this good of sound, hands-down. I can get these nice and LOUD, too (not necessarily a good thing for my ear drums, but it is what it is) - with NO distortions. There's a variety of tips and wings you can use in whatever combination you wish, and most people will probably find a combo that works for them. These actually stay in my ears comfortably - straight outta the box! I don't think I've gotten earbuds with wings that did that before. My husband has different shaped ears and likes swiping my best earphones - so he likes grabbing tips that fit him better, because we're night and day on what fits and feels good to us for earbuds like these. I can shake my head and bounce around in these vigorously - and they just stay PUT. FINALLY - yay! I have not experienced any blipping, hissing noises (like some reviewers are talking about), or anything weird with these at ALL thus far. They've been performing flawlessly for me, and I'm guessing if there were anything buggy about them, the firmware update must have taken care of any and all of that. I did not use them prior to the update, so I don't know if they would have sounded as good without that. Again - I would highly advise downloading the app the second you get these and get the update over with, to make sure you don't experience any potential bugs or complications others have claimed to have. Overall, I'm completely impressed with these in all ways. I have a ton of wireless earphones from all kinds of ranges, and I have my favorite over the ear kind(s), and a select few for earbuds that I enjoy. For wireless earbuds, these are #1 in my book. I love the flexibility for adjusting them through the app to whatever you need them for (you don't need a bass or electronic boost when you're trying to listen to a show or podcast, for instance), and they're just ridiculously easy to use, intuitive, sleek, and incredibly well-designed and comfortable. For the price, I think these are an absolute steal for the sound quality and what you get out of them. I would give these 10 stars, if I could - absolutely love them!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-23,Superior Ear Buds!,"What a great set of Ear Buds! What I Like:
Very well made of quality plastic and silicone. Sound is excellent - very full with nice bass, mid-range and treble. Very pleased with the battery life as well - can use them all day without batteries running out! Very comfortable in the ear - hold well and do not feel as if they are going to fall out like others that I have tried. Very please with these - highly recommend!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-27,Excellent,"These wireless earphones offer tremendous sound quality and bass. They are very stylish and are the perfect size. They came with a convenient wireless charging and carrying case. With over 16 options of different sized tips it was easy to find the perfect fit and level of comfort. The soundcore app is very useful, offering the opportunity to customize your EQ settings and also offering different sound options based on your personal preference such as bass booster/reducer and vocal booster. The ""Hear ID"" in the app is a unique feature that through a short sound test lets you personalize the sound in the earphones. Recent updates of the firmware has led to improvements of overall crispness of the sound. Buttons on the top of each earphones allow you to easily cycle through different tracks, control the volume and use voice assistant. HIghly recommended."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-02-29,"A trifecta of great sound, ergonomics, and usability","I've never known anyone who's not a professional musician as into music as my husband, so much so that, whenever we've needed to upgrade the car he drives every day, it *must* have an excellent stereo. Several months ago, I got him Anker's Soundcore Liberty 2 earbuds and he genuinely loves them and says they sound great for both music or even using just one of them to listen to an audiobook or podcast while working around the house. Not only do they have outstanding sound, they fit comfortably and the app let's him customize the function of the button on each for what he needs. Even the recharging case has been upgraded to support wireless charging just by sitting it on a phone charging pad and it still fits comfortably in his pocket. When I saw that this Pro version was available, he asked me to get them since he's been so happy with the originals. After over a week of use, these are his absolute favorite earbuds. The SoundCore app has a hearing test that can use the equalizer to compensate for hearing attenuation at various frequencies for each ear. He used it on himself and was surprised how much difference it made (and a bit sad to realize how much high frequency loss he has). This Pro model comes with different size ear pieces for both the ear canal and also the outer ear; his ears must be typical size since he didn't need to change these. Truly, a fantastic set of earbuds! Highly recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-02,Great sound; Smart TV connectivity issue,"I like these earbuds a lot. I have some cheaper models of true wireless earbuds and the difference in sound quality between those and these is pretty obvious. With these, it almost seems as if the music source is between your ears and the sound quality is high and clear. Their ergonomics are also good as they fit comfortably and snugly in my ears. The charging case is handy and I enjoy the wireless charging feature. I also like being able to easily use only one earbud for when I'm listening to some non music program and I can be more aware of surrounding sounds when I'm walking or working out. These are not inexpensive, but they are several notches above some of the lower cost alternatives. The only negative issue I've encountered with these is that they're quirky in connecting to my Samsung Smart TV. They tend to drop the connection, which is surprising because I've not encountered that issue with several other bluetooth headsets and the same tv. Not sure what the problem is, but I feel like it's a problem with the earbuds given my experience with other devices and the tv."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-04,Amazing earbuds for the price,"Did a lot of research on ear buds. These have great reviews, and they're a fraction of the price of similar-sounding buds. Only negative for some is the size. Doesn't bother me. I have a big head. Really great purchase."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-04,"Strong connection, excellent sound quality, but ear fit is a mixed bag","Paired with:
Google Pixel 4XL running most recent flavor of Android. Out of the box, you'll likely need to run a firmware update on the earbuds. This is a very simple process which requires the download of a companion application. Once the firmware is updated, you also have the option to full customize every aspect of the way the earbuds deliver sound. Pairing is very simple. Turn on your Bluetooth, leave the buds in the case, hit the pairing button on the case, choose the earbuds on your phone menu. 1 minute process at most. Sound quality is very good for this level of earbud. It's not perfect, but it's worthy of this level of earbud. Highs can be a little muddled, but you can adjust settings to assist that. Lows are very good for an earbud of this level. Vocals can seem washed out, but that can be adjusted as well. Connection is always strong and I've never come close to dropping connection. My one issue with these buds is that their fit can be a little off at times. There are numerous options to customize fit, but I'm just not completely happy, regardless of what fit I choose. It's a minor irritation though and they're never in any danger of falling out. Overall, I feel these earbuds are worthy of their pricing level. I've tested a lot of earbuds over the years and I'd characterize these as a strong 4 star set. Cheers!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-04,Punches well above its pay grade,"Anker's Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds uses a dual driver system that includes a 'Knowles balanced armature and an 11mm dynamic driver' to create an immersive soundstage with finely tuned treble and deep, rich bass. In addition to the two 65 mAh earbuds, this package includes 6 wings (2 each in S/M/L) and 14 ear tips with sizes ranging from XS to XL. Finally, there's a 500 mAh charging case that is equipped with fast charging and can be recharged via USB-C or wirelessly and 3 items of literature. What I liked most about these Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds is the sound. Anker boasts of having 10 Grammy award-winning producers recommending these earbuds because of the level of depth and nuance they can faithfully recreate. I have used these earbuds on both Apple and Samsung products listening to top 100 songs then a few movies and finally some of my favorite classical music pieces. The range of these Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds is second to none. Bass was tight and punchy on rock tunes, but could deeply resonate when listening to RnB, Hip Hop or explosions on action movies. Vocals were crisp and clean on pop and country music and some of my favorite classical sonnets and overtures were bright and lively with nice interplay between musical sections. Augmenting the sound is the Soundcore App that works in conjunction with the earbuds to deliver a customized experience tailored to the user's hearing. The app starts with a hearing test which helps the software determine the proper settings to use for each user. There are other EQ settings embedded within the app users can select however the default is recommended for most users. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the battery life as a positive for these earbuds. I've used them faithfully for over a month now and they're still getting over 30 hours on a single case charge. What I liked least about the Liberty 2 Pro True Wireless Earbuds was the weight of the earbuds. I expected a dual-driver earbud packing 11mm dynamic drivers to be a bit heavier than other earbuds but these are substantially heavier. I own several pairs of earbuds and sometimes I forget which pair I am wearing, except when I am wearing these. I immediately know these earbuds based on their weight alone. Another feature of these earbuds of which I wasn't particularly fond was the battery indicator lights. This implementation has become trite and I would like to see an actual battery percentage so I can make a more informed decision on when to charge the case. Overall, I am very impressed with these earbuds. They look great, they sound phenomenal and thanks to the app and the wide assortment of wings and tips you can customize your listening experience in ways many other earbuds simply cannot. I have listened to this headset side by side with a pair of B&O earbuds that cost over twice as much as these do and if I am being completely honest the Liberty 2 Pros hang stride-for-stride with their pricier competition. While I do give an edge to the B&O's when you need to listen to clean, flat sound I prefer the Liberty 2 Pros for my day to day commute because they're much louder, fit better and are tuned perfectly for my ears."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-05,White anker soundcore liberty 2 pro,I got my white version... Delivered here in saudi in good condition... The sound quality is very nice.. I love the color combination...
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-05,Great sound and we'll made,Amazing sound quality and very well made. Could use location in the app in case one is misplaced so it can be found
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-05,Truly excellent sound and battery life,"These are a big upgrade from the first version - Improvements in every area. And the sound quality is fantastic, outstripping many much more expensive name brand models. On the plus side:
- Truly excellent sound quality – great highs, mods, bass, and volume. Crisp and clear without being boomy or piercing. The easily beat Bose NC700's for sound quality, and are a decent match for voice quality on phone calls. - Bluetooth 5 with a high quality codec (long range and high quality sound)
- Lots of great equalizer presets (and a custom setting based on your hearing) and the high quality codec is still used when equalizer settings are on (many products drop to a lower quality codec then)
- Very good battery life (claimed 8 hours in the buds and 24 hours of recharge in the case) but that's dependent on volume and signal strength (I get about 25% less than that)
- Small, high quality case with USB-C and Wireless charging
- Fast Charging (about 2 hours for a 10 minute charge claimed)
- A large variety of ""wing"" and ""plug"" sizes so you should be able to find a good, comfortable fit
- They turn on when you open the case, and take them out, and turn off when you put them in and close the case
On the minus side:
- When transferring between the case and your ears, you have to rotate in two directions to give them the correct orientation to put in the case or place in your ears. - You need to use a Soundcore App to get full functionality which means you only get full functionality when used with android and ios devices
- There is no ""pass through"" or ""ambient sound"" capability to remain aware of your surroundings
- There is no electronic ""noise cancellation"" capability, and mechanical noise isolation is medium so these would not be suitable for air (or other noisy) travel
- No ""touch controls"" - one tiny button on each earbud so most controls are in the app
- They are a bit big and heavy, so probably not the best for strenuous activity
I'm very happy with these and highly recommend them because my main priorities are great sound, loudness, and battery life. But some might miss some of the features they lack, so take a close look at the pluses and minuses before buying."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-07,Good for it’s price,They definitely aren’t the loudest but if you use the sound ID feature it is probably one of the nicest sounds I’ve had the privilege to hear i don’t have a lot of money but i saved $100 by not buying AirPod pros. I might upgrade in the future simply because they are mostly comfortable but it hurts on the left side if i wear them for a couple hours also if I’m using them to talk on the phone the person I’m talking to can’t hear me very clearly maybe just enough to have a short conversation luckily for me i don’t talk on the phone much but otherwise i suggest them to others. Also some users had mentioned a white noise that bothered them? I kinda hear it but it doesn’t bother me even a little i hardly even notice in fact i didn’t even notice until i listened for it but most the time it’s not noticeable good product for its price
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-07,GreT,Great for listening to music. Could be better for noise canceling.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-08,These are better quality than the top selling ear “buds” available currently!,"I’m not hugely technologically savvy. But I am a music aficionado! And my kids all have Air Pods! After I got these in and began messing around with them, my kids all felt like they got ripped off with their Air Pods! Yes, these headphones are adjustable with an app, and you can tell a sound quality difference. They are equipped with multiple ear plugs for custom fit and the case is way more State of the Art than what the popular earbuds are housed in. Overall, I would of paid easily regular price for these. I did get a great promotion for a few bucks off which motivated me to buy MYSELF two pair. Both black and white ones! I can say that the sound is as loud as the Air Pods but more importantly these have better clarity and customization of the Equalizer app. I will really laughed at all the people who’ve overpaid for a NAME BRAND that is best known but absolutely not the best quality. I can’t think of any drawbacks and whoever said noise cancellation was an issue isn’t utilizing the custom feature to adjust the user’s own core hearing attributes which is also a notable function; the audio test in which you signal when you no longer hear any tone. It allows for customizing the headphones to the listener’s personal ability to detect background noise and any “buzz.” The clarity is unreal. Overall I’m very pleased and I’m one of those “Karen’s” that usually asks to “speak to the manager!” Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro’s ROCK! Literally! Totally digging it!"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-11,360 degree surround sound which paired with the crystal clear microphone makes these perfect !,"Great for communication with team members while multi player gaming; ie. PUBG mobile, Fo...Fo...For... rtnight. Yucky! So what I am saying is that I am really in love with these headphones after all the various semi wireless kind (like ink’d by skullcandy). The case is awesome and has a magnetic snap in place position inside of the earbud case. It will recharge the earbuds like 3 times. Each charge gives me about 10 hours of use. I asked for a recommendation from my fellow gamers and this was the favorite amongst them."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-13,"BIG sound, BIG bass -- but not ""pure""","Do you like a big sound with big bass that will blow you away? These are the ear buds for you! Do you prefer to hear the subtleties and nuance of your music -- then there are better choices. The earbuds are larger than most I have tried but still about as comfortable as others. Battery life also seems to be comparable. Because they put out so much sound, if you use them in an open office, you can basically escape into an ""alone cone"" and not hear any of your co-workers. They are solidly made and don't feel as delicate as smaller earbuds. They have the requisite assortment of ear-tips and charging case. While I'm impressed at the big full sound that these produce, I do prefer more balanced earbuds that don't sacrifice the mid and high end of music just to wow you with bass... however, I love classical music so I am not necessarily the target demographic for this set. It is all a matter of personal preference. [lCVR]"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-03-15,Great for listening to media. Inferior microphone quality. Not me for phone calls,"These soundcore liberty 2 pro earbuds are amazing for music listening but not for making phone calls. Even though these earbuds have multiple microphones, everyone i talked to complained that the sound quality was terrible, that i sounded muffled."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-16,"Best on the market, but you must update the firmware and only use ONE earbud for phone conversations","The best on the market in the $100-$230 price range for music sound quality, but you MUST update the firmware immediately per instructions. The app is a real plus for customizing your music experience with the personal hearing tests, and also the user selectable preset eq settings. However the customized personal equalizer setting from the sound test can distort your phone call experience; potentially more than some of the preset eq settings users may try/use. Initially listeners on my phone calls complained about the sound quality, while I was simultaneously experiencing a lot of reverb. This lasted for the first 5-8 phone calls while I was using both ear buds, whichis how I used to do with my Bose Sports. I then decided to use only one ear bud (right side), which gave some improvement, and that prompted me to try using only the left ear bud instead. Using the left ear bud for phone calls made things better, so I decided to try the right earbud again for a few calls to make sure there was a real improvement, and it worked equally as well as the left. People are now fine with the call sound quality, and the reverb I had experienced has vanished. My hypothesis for the improved sound quality is: a) the combination of four microphones (2/ear bud) creates havoc for the noise cancellation chip and software, and b) there may be some software adaptation that helps with voice calls as long as you only use one earbud (like a normal blu tooth bud for phone calls). These are just speculative on my part however. I’m really glad I purchased these and I now feel confident with them for both audio and phone call use."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-20,Absolutely love it !,Have tried all high end ones ! But this one tops it all !
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-20,Good performance in a pair of wireless earbuds,"I have a lot of experience with all sorts of headsets, so I was excited to try these new wireless earbuds. Just to get the basics out of the way, I'd rate the packaging, build quality and so forth as very good. Materials, fit and finish and so forth are all very good for a product in this price range. The charging approach is also very convenient - charge the case with the earbuds and they charge along with the backup battery in the case itself, giving you power for maybe 30 hours of usage altogether. Battery life seems to depend on how loud you like your music...I probably averaged about 7-8 hours per charge, with less on a few occasions that I blame on walking around far from the music source and playing music a little louder than usual. Pairing is simple too - if you've ever paired any sort of Bluetooth device with a phone or computer, there won't be anything magic here. In my testing, I've used the Soundcore's on Mac and Windows PCs, iOS phones and tablets, and just for kicks, I tried to pair them to the bluetooth enabled audio panel in a small airplane...no drama with any of this. I did notice slightly better sound quality when connected to my Apple iPad Pro (the latest generation)...not sure I can explain why, but this device seemed to stand out as the best sound quality. The only minor feature that's missing is the lack of a wired solution. If you sometimes need to plug into a device that doesn't have bluetooth, you're out of luck with these Soundcore earbuds. Audio quality for phone calls and so forth seemed very good...connected to my iPhone, I never got any complaints about sound quality, and a few folks commented that my voice sounded better than usual, even though they didn't know I was using these earbuds. Where the review gets more complex is sound quality...here's how I measured and compared. First, I created a standard playlist of about a dozen tracks I'm very familiar with. There's one podcast that's exclusively voices, and a mix of music featuring male and female performers from loud and edgy to more laid back and mellow. I figured I'd compare the Soundcore to most of the headsets I have handy, wired and wireless. At the super-high end, I have a pair of Shure SE846...I'm not sure this is fair - the Shure's are over five times the price of these Soundcores. I also tried a pair of older Shure SE535 (wired), a pair of Apple Airpods, and similar wireless earbud products from Jabra and Skullcandy. To round out the competition, I also tried a pair of ""on ear"" B&O H8 headphones, and a similar pair of conventional headphones from Bose and Sennheiser. Before getting into the details, I want to make it clear that in most cases, the details aren't dramatic - especially among the wireless earbuds in the mix. The Soundcore's are definitely competitive with most of what's out there today, but there are subtle differences here and there that my testing pointed out. If you listen in a noisy environment or with poor quality material in the first place, you might never notice any of the things I'm going to point out. With that disclaimer out of the way, out of the mix I tested with, the Soundcore performed somewhat better than the Apple Airpods and the Skullcandy wireless in-ear products. I'd say the Jabra is about equal overall, depending on what you like to listen to. The two Shure products - both much more expensive than the Soundcore - are really the only ones that I'd say were night-and-day above the rest, but that shouldn't be a surprise: you want the absolute best sound quality, be prepared to spend a grand. Some prior reviews pointed out a high degree of hum and noise, audible as background hiss. To be clear, on all of the systems I tested with, I never heard anything like this, so Soundcore seems to have solved that problem. The positives of the Soundcore are its midrange performance at medium volume levels. To my ear, the low-end is a bit over-pronounced and slightly muddy, and the top few octaves are shrill and edgy. In between - where you find male vocals and so on - the Soundcore is very good indeed. The muddy bass is pretty typical for this class of product: the small space available tends to let the designer choose between leaving the bass out, or going too far and getting a result that stretches the drivers a little too far for their size. Soundcore gives you plenty of bass - perhaps too much sometimes - but in so doing, they sacrifice the precision and ""punch"" more expensive products with bigger bass drivers can deliver. Of course, the products that can deliver better and more accurate bass are much more expensive than the Soundcore. At the other end of the spectrum, I found the highest octaves a bit shrill and edgy for my liking, especially at lounder volumes. To an extent, this actually helps the Soundcore reproduce spoken voices a bit better than the competition - I actually enjoyed listening to podcasts and news reports, for example. But with music having a lot of high frequency content - think high-pitched female voices - I didn't like the sound coming out of the Soundcore. Someone once told me that good audio equipment should draw you in, never making you want to get up and shut it off - with the wrong material, that's exactly the sensation I got from the Soundcore. To expand on my comment that the Jabra and the Soundcore are about equal, I think overall the Soundcore has marginally better bass, notwithstanding my comments above...Jabra gives you weaker but more accurate bass, while Soundcore gives you more - though at somewhat lower quality. I think the Soundcore midrange is clearly better than Jabra, but Jabra's high end wins pretty handily. The choice probably comes down to what you want to listen to...podcasts, male vocals and music that's heavy in the midrange - I'd go with the Soundcore...music that emphasizes the high frequencies, I'd probably go with the Jabra. The larger ""on ear"" headphones are another dimension altogether with a very different user experience. Like all in-ear units, the Soundcore earbuds tend to give you better isolation from sounds in the environment than most on-ear units. But because the on-ear units have room for bigger drivers and so forth, they tend to give you a very different sound. If you're unsure, you should definitely try...the experience is very different between on-ear units and an in-ear unit. Bottom line is that for the price, the Soundcore Earbuds are good performances with a lot going for them. If you're considering Apple Airpods, I'd take a close look at Soundcore - they're better in practically every dimension. If you're looking at Jabra, Skullcandy or any of the no-name brands, Soundcore is also a fine choice, depending on what your preferences in music are. On top of that, Soundcore seems to have created a high-quality and convenient product that pairs with just about any bluetooth source and just plain works. They're definitely worth a look."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-20,Great Sound!!! Could use one more button.,"These are very nice wireless headphones. I really like almost everything about the. I will be comparing them to the Jabra Elite Active 65t as those are my normal workout headphones
Sound:
The Anker Soundcore Liberty Pro 2 has fantastic sound in both the higher tones and some great bass. I’ve seen a few other reviews that mentioned a tone until they did a software update. I didn’t have any issues like that. From the first time I put them in my ears there was perfect sound. Jabra has decent sound but the low end bass is definitely not as good and so its missing that full bodied tone. Noise Cancellation:
Anker has total noise cancellation. I couldn’t hear anything in my surroundings when I had these in. This is both great and not great as there isn’t a hear through option. So while I’d use these in my house, car or yard I would be reluctant to do and biking, hiking, running with them since I wouldn’t be able to hear anything in my surroundings. Still great for if I want to shut out the entire world and ignore everyone else. Jabra has good noise cancellation but there is still some minor bleed through even in the noise cancellation more. But there is also a hear though option for these and you the listener can turn it up or down according to your needs. These are much better for me if I’m doing something and need to have some indication of what is going on in my surroundings. Battery Life:
I’m really impressed with Anker’s battery life. I used the headphones everyday for 3-5 hours for two and a half weeks before I needed to plug in the case for charging. The battery life with the charges was fantastic. I think it ended up being somewhere around 50-60 hours. Jabra’s battery life also fits my needs but I find that with the same usage I need to charge my pod about 1x a week. Fit:
The Anker fit decently. There are a lot of options in the box for eartips and earwings that most people should be able to find a good combo that works for them. They stayed pretty snug and I never felt like I was at risk of them falling out. Jabra only had 3 sizes of eartips to select from and the design is different that you twist them into your ears. Mine fit perfect and stay secure running, hiking, biking and during HIIT routines. I think that both are very comparable in the fit category and it will be personal preference on if you like the earwings or not. Buttons:
Anker has one button on top of each headphone. These are supposed to do all of your functions. To turn the headphones on and off it is one tap on either side. To fast forward and rewind it is a long hold on the left or right headphone. I did really well with these functions. But to turn the volume up and down it is a 1s hold on the left or right depending on if you want to increase or decrease the volume. I struggled with this so much. Most of the time I ended up just turning the unit on of off accidentally. I think I’m actually 1 for 5 in getting the volume to adjust instead of just playing the game where I’m powering the unit on and off. I really wish they would have designed it with just one more button. Jabra has a toggle button on the center of each headphone. The app has a great description of how to work the toggles and how long to press for the function you’d like. It made figuring everything out easy and there are enough options that I don’t accidentally turn the headphones off anytime I want to change the volume. Software App:
The Anker app allows you to do a few things. It does the initial set up of your device, if you can find a quiet enough place, to customize the earphones to your specific age/hearing needs. You can also select the kind of audio you are listening to for some preset configurations. But that is about all you can do with the app. It was not the most user-friendly app and I thought your should be able to do more with it. Jabra app lets you adjust the hear through of your device and adjust the settings for type of music you are listening to as well. It has a usermanual loaded and you can get to a few things when not connected to the headphones. It will also help you connect them if you are having issues. Other:
There are a few other comparisons to make that offer some insight on the difference between these. Jabra you can use one headphone at a time but it must be the one for the right ear to work. Anker you can use right or left. Anker will only connect to one device at a time. Problematic for me since I use both my phone and an iPod depending on what I’m doing. Jabra will connect to 2 devices at a time. Overall whether these are the headphones for you will probably just depend on your needs. If you need to hear your surroundings ever then Jabra might fit your life, but if you just want to tune out the entire world and listen to your beats, then Anker has a lot to offer."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,0,2020-03-21,Excellent true wireless earbuds.,"Anker's Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro wireless earbuds work well, are comfortable, and sound great. The earbuds are made from plastic in a mixture of fake metal, glossy, and rubberized. The included case is made from plastic with a rubberized exterior and glossy interior. The plastics used are all high quality and the earbuds are very nicely made. The case feels great in the hand and the magnetically closed sliding lid is smooth and satisfying. Even the packaging is nicely done and easy to open. The earbuds paired up quickly and smoothly with my iPhone XR running iOS 13. Once they were paired initially anytime I slid open the case the earbuds would pair with my phone again. They are very convenient to whip out in the middle of a phone conversation, place into the ear with one hand, and have pair up automatically. Fit wise they come with a variety of ear tip and ear canal wing silicones. There should be enough range for practically every ear. They fit me comfortably and securely. I can wear them when walking, working out, and doing housework without fear of them slipping out or needing to be constantly re-adjusted. Sound quality is very good for the this type of headphone. Bass is strong, but not overpowering. Vocals sound warm and crisp. Instruments sound distinct and pleasant. There is a nice balance to the sound quality. Sound quality can be tailored to your ears using the free Anker app to test your hearing. I found they sound best when left in the default mode. I listened to a wide range of musical genres from pop, to rock, to soundtracks, to classical, and all sounded equally pleasant. They are also excellent for listening to podcasts and taking phone calls. The ear buds have a physical button on each one. The control can be tailored in the app to manage a number of different setting, but the choices are a bit limited. I do appreciate that a long button press can summon Siri. Battery life is excellent. The buds last me a few hours before needing to re-charge in the case and the case lasts me weeks between charges. I use the buds for about 5 hours every week, FYI. The case can be charged via USB or wirelessly with a Qi charger. I charged them wireless on two different branded chargers and both charged perfectly. All in all... excellent buds."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-03-24,Expensive upgrade from Liberty Neos,"I’ve been enjoying my Soundcore Liberty Neos for the past year. Then I got a change to try these out and they are an obvious upgrade. The sound quality and the mic quality are both improved, but the difference isn’t dramatic considering the difference in price. These are quite a bit more expensive and if you want to save money I don’t think you’ll be unhappy with Liberty Neos. I will say that I really like the way Neos fit. But that’s JustMe."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-27,"Very comfortable, bassy and lovable","Whatever those Grammy (TM) producers did to these headphones, they did the right way. There is absolutely zero distortion in sound no matter the volume or bass level (and boy can these crank). I have always had trouble with buds staying in my ears. These headphones were then perfect for someone like myself, with different ear shapes. This came with sets of wingtips and 5 different sizes/styles of buds. This allows for both a snug fight and a correct angle for the drivers directly towards your hearing canals. This allows for a wide range with a seemingly open soundstage that can only be rivaled by the bass these put out. Stock, out of the box, I was amazed. Now, almost 3 months later, I can say they sound amazing (better than sony wh1000xm3) in my personal test. Find the preset that works best for you (not the music type it tells you; the best preset for bass heavy rap is actually piano (prepare yourself and crank it up). In the end, what isnt there to like. Wireless charging, big powerful drivers, great battery life, excellent, top of the line sound and sound reproduction, working mics for making phonecalls. with either bud in. Oh yeah they have a built in one earbud mode. These things are clever, clean and definitely worth the purchase, Fantastic gift idea or workout pair replacementt."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-03-29,"Great sound, but bluetooth connection need more improvement","so far I have tried this one, Razer Hammerhead TWS, Sony WF 1000 XM3, Air pods, Air pods pro. I must say this one probably have the best sound quality of all of them. but the I feel the Bluetooth connection is not as strong as others'"
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-03-31,Perfect,Perfect for jogging
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,1,2020-04-03,Disappointing,"I was looking for an alternative to Apple AirPods, given their built-in battery deterioration. These were well reviewed but a little expensive. I have other Anker products that have worked well, so I thought I’d try these and hoped for the best. In almost all respects they work well. Sound quality is very good but not spectacular. So far, the best feature is battery life, which is terrific. But they have a terrible habit of losing their synch with my tablet. Any re-pairing some times takes several tries. Apple has this down pat. They come with adjustable ear pieces, but I have yet to find a great fit after several adjustments. I’ve never noticed any significant noise cancellation. Given their premium price and less well known brand name, they really should perform better. If I’m going back to Apple."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,3,0,2020-04-09,Comfortable headphones but music is lacking,"These are great for comfort and they come with a lot of tips and the little rubber things that brace them against your ear canal. The battery life is solid and they come in a snazzy white recharging box that has a slide lid. The whole thing in white is pretty futuristic looking and they are sure to turn heads. They sound good for phone calls and people reported that they could be heard without issue and could hear me clearly. As far as music goes these are just okay. They sound a little flat and the treble is less than sparkly. The bass is sort of all over the place. Sometimes it's overwhelming, and sometimes it's lacking. Overall these are good enough headphones if you're trying to save some money over more expensive headphones, but temper your expectations that these can compete with similar but more expensive headphones by Sony, Sennheiser, or Bang and Olafssen."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-12,First time ear buds user,My husband was so jealous of the sound quality of these ear buds that he had to order a pair for himself. I like the fact that you can adjust the sound via app to your personal preference.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-04-13,These are amazing!,"After having had Airpods (the regular kind), and using these, I vote for these! They will fit anybody's ears because they have so many different choices for the silicone parts that help them stay in your hear. For me, Airpods always wind up making my ears sore because they're hard to and too large, but with these I was able to use the smallest parts to put in and they fit my ears perfectly, and without any pain. The charging doc is larger than the Airpods, but I actually love the design, almost like a flat egg and they charge up quickly and last a long time. Sound quality is amazing AND you get noise cancelling! You can't get that with the Airpods at this price. These are the best wireless earbuds I've ever owned and would highly recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,0,2020-04-14,Be sure to use the extra ear pieces for good fit,"We were a little worried we had a product that was not going to work for my teenage son because the earbuds kept falling out of his ears. He didn't see anything in the directions but there was a helpful review that there were other attachments to custom fit to the person's ear. Since then, these have been great. Great sound quality, easy bluetooth connection, and they look nice to boot."

Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-26,whe products come on sale help,I like the quality and the price for this kind of product was as good the reviews i will buy other products in the future thanks
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-27,Great AuDiO But They Wont Stay In My Ears,"I will get right to the point . Great Sound Even Better Than My Liberty Air II . B U T T T
Id such high hopes for the Liberty 2 Pro But Just Like My Liberty Air II The Liberty 2 Pro Will Not Stay In My Ears Even With The Largest Wing & EarTips . The Only True Wireless Earphones So Far That AbSoLutLy StAy In My Ears No MaTtEr WhAt ArE tHeE Buds+Plus . I Returned The Buds+Plus Because I Was Disappointed Overall But I May Buy Them Again Because They Sound Decent And Never Came Out Of My Ears No Matter What I Did Until I Physically Removed Them By Hand ."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-28,Worth every penny,"I had done a bunch of research to find which truly wireless buds to get, knowing that the top top of the line $300+ models weren't an option. After spending days scouring the internet for different reviews on different brands and models and makes, I decided this was the way to go. All the reviews said that the sound quality was amazing, they hold in the ear well, and have incredible battery life, and they are all correct. In fact, the only con I really saw about them was that call quality isn't very good, but since I literally go through great lengths to avoid talking on the phone, that wasn't an issue for me. The sound is great, and well balanced, not bass heavy, but enough to actually hear it in the mix. I've tried cheaper buds and it sounded like the music was being played through a tin can, with the bass mixed out. You can hear the mix really well with these, all the little subtle sounds in a mix are easily picked out, and the battery life is phenomenal. It came with three different sized wing tips, and I believe 6 or 7 different silicone bud options, so they can fit literally any ear you could find. Would recommend."
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,4,1,2020-04-28,Excellent sound with some negatives.,Really great sound and well made app to customize sound. There is a bit of static when listening to podcasts that us a little annoying but not noticeable when listening to music. Wish they included transparent or hear through feature at this price point.
Anker,Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro,5,1,2020-04-28,Lo mejor!,Muy buen sonido de alta calidad !
