Once we had the intersecting words and the usage ratio, we  the data set was grouped by word and summed the ratios of instances of that word. These words were then sorted by their usage ratio. The Following word cloud shows the top 40 uniquely positive words. From this cloud we can see the adjectives people use to describe the products.
